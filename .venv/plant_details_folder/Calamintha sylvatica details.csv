It has very similar properties to lesser calamint (C. nepeta) though is milder in its actions[238]. It is sometimes cultivated as a medicinal herb for household use. The whole plant is aromatic, diaphoretic and expectorant[4]. The leaves are harvested in July as the plant comes into flower and are dried for storage[4]. An infusion is beneficial in cases of fevers, flatulent colic and weaknesses of the stomach[4], it is also used to treat depression, insomnia and painful menstruation[238]. Its expectorant action makes it a good cough and cold remedy and it is of value for treating mild respiratory infections[254]. It is best mixed with other herbs, especially yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)[254]. Calamint should not be prescribed for pregnant women since in excess it can cause a miscarriage[238]."

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. It usually germinates in 2 weeks at 21°c[138]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and, if they grow sufficiently, plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer otherwise wait until the following spring. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be planted direct into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are well rooted before planting them out in the summer. Basal cuttings in May or June. They should be rooted in a sandy compost[245]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
