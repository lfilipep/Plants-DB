An infusion is beneficial in cases of fevers, flatulent colic and weaknesses of the stomach[4], it is also used to treat depression, insomnia and painful menstruation[238]. Its expectorant action makes it a good cough and cold remedy and it is of value for treating mild respiratory infections[254].
