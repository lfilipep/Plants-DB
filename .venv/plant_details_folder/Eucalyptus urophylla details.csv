4,Known Hazards,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269 ]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269 ]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269 ]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269 ]."
5,Habitats,"Frequently occurs as the dominant species in open, often secondary montane forests, where it grows on mountain slopes and in valleys[303 ]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Eucalyptus urophylla is an evergreen Tree growing to 40 m (131ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects, Birds. The plant is self-fertile. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The species is useful in protecting river banks and for providing shade[325 ]. Because it has no major soil requirements, it is increasingly being used in reforestation programmes, both in flooded soils and in dry soils in tropical lowlands[303 , 325 ]. Other Uses: The bark has a tannin content of over 10%, but it is not used commercially[303 ]. The leaves yield a pale yellow oil. The major components of the oil are paecymene (76%), alpha-pinene (7%) and gamma terpenene (4%). The essential oil is a good source of paracymene, which possesses disinfectant properties and is utilized in soapmaking and in the perfumery industry[303 ]. The heartwood is pinkish-brown to red-brown, and contains little gum[310 ]. It is moderately durable, comparatively light compared to other Eucalypts, fairly easy to saw[310 ]. It is used in heavy construction, bridging, flooring and framing. The round wood is used for building poles and fence posts[303 ]. It is particularly suitable as a source of mid-density to low-density eucalypt fibre for pulp and paper production[303 ]. It makes satisfactory fuel wood and charcoal[303 ]. It has been used to produce hybrid species as it appears to be insect-resistant, including a timber with a trade name of ""Lyptus"", hybridised with Eucalyptus grandis, commonly known as the rose gum or flooded gum."
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: SRCA plant of humid and sub-humid tropical areas, where it is found at elevations from sea level up to 3,000 metres[303 ]. It is found in areas with a mean annual temperature of 24 - 28?c and a mean annual rainfall of 700 - 2,500 mm[303 ]. In its natural range the rainfall is monsoonal with 2 - 8 dry months per year[325 ]. Develops best on deep, moist, well-drained, acidic or neutral soils derived from volcanic or metamorphic rock[303 ]. It is also commonly found on basalt, schist and slates, but rarely on limestone[303 ]. It tolerates poor soils as long as the texture is loose[325 ]. A fast-growing tree, especially when young. Trees in one planting had reached an average height of 27 metres when 8 years old[310 ]. Flowering usually starts within 2 years from planting[303 ], and good seed production starts around the age of 4 years[310 ].. The tree has good coppicing ability and can be expected to produce at least 3 coppice rotations after the initial seedling rotation[303 ]. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200 ]. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Propagation Seed - surface sow in a sunny position and make sure the compost is not allowed to dry out[11 , 78 , 134 ]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2?c[200 ]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well[200 ]. The seedlings are ready for planting in the field when they are 25 - 30 cm tall, usually after 10 - 12 weeks[310 ]. The seed has a long viability[200 ]. Rooted cuttings derived from stump sprouts are also used in raising E. Urophylla. After coppicing, when the new sprouts are 60 - 80 cm long, they are removed and divided into cuttings with 2 pairs of leaves[303 ]. In Indonesia, tissue culture has proved successful on an experimental scale[303 ]."
