24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light rich slightly alkaline soil that is not too dry, and a warm sunny position[1, 200]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance[1]. A polymorphic species[58]. Adenophora nikoensis is sometimes separated into two different species, in which the plant with calyx lobes serrate is named A. nipponica and that with entire ones as A. nikoensis. These two forms, however, are often observed in the same place and cannot really be separated[275]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, they have been known to destroy even mature plants[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. Surface sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot in the spring in order to avoid transplanting[133]. We have found that if transplanted when very small seedlings grow away without difficulty[K]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 10°c[133]. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst young. Basal cuttings in spring[K]. Division in spring - very difficult because the plant dislikes root disturbance[1]..,
