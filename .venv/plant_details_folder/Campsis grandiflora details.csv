They are used in the treatment of women's complaints[147, 178]. A decoction of the flowers is used to correct menstrual disorders, rheumatoid pains, traumatic injuries, difficult urination, pruritis and oozing dermaphytoses[147, 218]."
20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be allowed to scramble on the ground and will form an effective ground cover, rooting at intervals along the branches[208]. They should be planted about 2.5 metres apart each way[208]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a good well-drained loam[11, 200] and a very sunny position[166] or light shade[200]. Tolerates moderately alkaline or moderately acid soils[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -10°c[200], though they require a sunny sheltered wall or hot summers if they are to flower well[11, 166]. The fresh young growth in spring is often damaged by late frosts[208]. Plants can take some years to settle down before they start to flower[202]. They climb by means of aerial roots but need to be supported[11, 166]. Another report says that this species does not produce aerial roots[219]. Plants can be pruned like grapes (Vitis spp.)[11] and any pruning is best done in the spring[188]. The sub-species C. grandiflora thunbergii tolerates saline winds[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse at 10°c. Two months stratification at 5°c assists germination[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame. Slow to root but a fair percentage[78, 200]. Root cuttings 5cm long in December. Fair to good percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[202]. Layering in winter[188]. Plants often self-layer[260]."
