See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from June to October, in flower from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",C. adrepens. C. chinensis. Voss.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Blood tonic  Carminative  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Women's complaintsThe flowers and the whole plant are blood tonic, carminative, depurative diuretic and febrifuge[147, 178, 218]. They are used in the treatment of women's complaints[147, 178]. A decoction of the flowers is used to correct menstrual disorders, rheumatoid pains, traumatic injuries, difficult urination, pruritis and oozing dermaphytoses[147, 218].",,"Plants can be allowed to scramble on the ground and will form an effective ground cover, rooting at intervals along the branches[208]. They should be planted about 2.5 metres apart each way[208].",,"Succeeds in a good well-drained loam[11, 200] and a very sunny position[166] or light shade[200]. Tolerates moderately alkaline or moderately acid soils[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -10°c[200], though they require a sunny sheltered wall or hot summers if they are to flower well[11, 166]. The fresh young growth in spring is often damaged by late frosts[208]. Plants can take some years to settle down before they start to flower[202]. They climb by means of aerial roots but need to be supported[11, 166]. Another report says that this species does not produce aerial roots[219]. Plants can be pruned like grapes (Vitis spp.)[11] and any pruning is best done in the spring[188]. The sub-species C. grandiflora thunbergii tolerates saline winds[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse at 10°c. Two months stratification at 5°c assists germination[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame. Slow to root but a fair percentage[78, 200]. Root cuttings 5cm long in December. Fair to good percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[202]. Layering in winter[188]. Plants often self-layer[260].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
