It is used in the treatment of rheumatism, scabies and neuralgia[240, 243, 272]. It is also taken internally in the treatment of hook worms[243]. The juice of the leaves is used in the treatment of coughs[272]. Both the juice and the whole leaves are usd as an anthelmintic that is effective against hookworms[272].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but not boggy humus rich soil in shade or semi-shade[11, 182]. A peat and moisture loving species, it requires a lime-free soil[11, 182]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it only succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. It grows well in Cornwall[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The bruised leaves have a powerful camphor-like scent[245]. The flowers are scented like lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis)[245]. This species is highly variable in the size and shape of leaves. In general these varieties are the result of habitat differences. If in forest understories or at forest margins, it is a large shrub or small tree with large leaves. If on sunny slopes or among thickets, it is often a small shrub with narrow leaves[266].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. Pre-chill for 4 - 10 weeks and then surface sow in a lime-free compost in a shady part of the greenhouse and keep the compost moist[78]. The seed usually germinates well, usually within 1 - 2 months at 20°c, but the seedlings are liable to damp off. It is important to water them with care and to ensure that they get plenty of ventilation. Watering them with a garlic infusion can also help to prevent damping of[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are about 25mm tall and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. The seedlings are susceptible to spring frosts so might need some protection for their first few years outdoors. The leaves remain very small for the first few years[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 3 - 6cm long, July/August in a frame in a shady position. They form roots in late summer or spring[78]. A good percentage usually take. Division in spring just before new growth begins[200]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Layering.",
