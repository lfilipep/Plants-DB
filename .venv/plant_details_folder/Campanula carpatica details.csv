Form: Spreading or horizontal.","Campanula carpatica is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Plants make a good ground cover when planted about 30cm apart each way, forming a spreading clump[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden. Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in a sunny position though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. A very easy species to grow, it will tolerate almost any soil or situation though it prefers the fullest amount of sun[221]. Plants grow well on a sunny wall so long as the roots have soil to grow into[219]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A very free-flowering plant, indeed it has one of the longest flowering periods of any species in this genus[271]. If the plant is cut back as the flowers fade, it will usually produce a second flush of flowers later in the season[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. This species, however, especially under garden conditions, is more likely to produce hybrids than most other members of the genus[271]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A very variable species in the wild[271]. There are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Chewton Joy' has pleasantly flavoured leaves[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Suitable for cut flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. Seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. Very easy from seed[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
