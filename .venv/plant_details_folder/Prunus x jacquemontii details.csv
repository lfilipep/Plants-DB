4,Known Hazards,"The plant (especially the seed and young shoots) contains cyanogenic glycosides, especially amygdalin and prunasin. When injested, these compounds break down in the digestive tract to release cyanide. Used in small quantities in both traditional and conventional medicine, this exceedingly poisonous compound has been shown to stimulate respiration, improve digestion, and promote a sense of well-being[238]. It is also claimed by some to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer - though this claim has been largely refuted. In larger concentrations, however, cyanide can cause gasping, weakness, excitement, pupil dilation, spasms, convulsions, coma and respiratory failure leading to death[293]. The fruits and flowers of most members of this genus generally have low or very low concentrations of this toxin, though the seeds and young shoots can contain much higher levels. The levels of toxin can be detected by the level of bitterness:- for example sweet tasting almond seeds are a major food crop and are often eaten in quantity, whilst bitter tasting almond seeds are used as a flavouring (in marzipan for example) but are not usually eaten on their own. In general, it can be considered safe to eat any fruit or seed from species in this genus that either have a sweet flavour or are slightly bitter. Great caution should be taken, however, if the flavour is moderately to very bitter[K].",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prunus x jacquemontii is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

16,Plant Habitats,,
17,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Juicy[11 ]. The red, ovoid fruit is around 10 - 15mm in diameter[11 , 74 ]. The fruit of most of the species in this section is distinguished by its fleshiness and juiciness, as well as by its pleasant taste[74 ]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",
18,Medicinal Uses,,
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",
20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168 ]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168 ]. As they are rather resistant to drought, the species of this section may be of interest as drought-resistant stock and as sources of drought-resistant strains by crossing with cultivated strains of cherry. They may also be useful in non-irrigated fruit growing areas as stock for regrafting with cultivated strains[74 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a dry, sunny position[11 ]. Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11 , 200 ]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[74 ]. The plant produces new shoots over 30cm long during a season - these are then well furnished with flowers towards the middle of the following spring[11 ]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238 ]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200 ]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200 ]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200 ]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113 ]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, mid summer in a frame[11 , 200 ]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200 ]. Layering in spring.",
