The plant has cleistogamous flowers - these do not open in the usual way but are self-pollinated by the plant. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus.

If seed is in short supply it can be surface sown in a cold frame in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. Division in spring. Large clumps can be planted out direct into their permanent positions whilst it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are ready to be planted out.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
