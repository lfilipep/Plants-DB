21,Other Uses Description,"Makes a good hedge or screen, especially when growing in a lightly shaded position[25]. The canes can be used as plant supports[25]. The canes and foliage are used to make hardboard and cardboard[25, 61, 195].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover. Requires a good humus rich loam with ample moisture in the growing season[200]. Prefers partial shade[200], growing well in thin woodland[11]. A very hardy plant[25], tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c without much damage[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. When grown near water it makes a good cover for wild fowl etc[25]. The rootstock is very rampant and difficult to remove once established[11, 25]. New shoots are produced from April[25]. Special Features:Invasive, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - if possible, surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Stored seed is best sown as soon as it is received. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could be a few years. Plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division in late spring as new growth commences. Take large divisions, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main clump as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Divisions of less than 5 - 6 culms rarely succeed[200].",
