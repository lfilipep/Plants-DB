The source of liquorice powder that is extracted and used in sweets, baked goods, ice cream, soft drinks etc[7, 34, 100, 183], it is also used medicinally. A sweet and delicious flavour, but the root is very fibrous[K]. The root contains glycyrrhizin, a substance that is 50 times sweeter than sucrose[171, 183, 238]. The dried root is often used for chewing, it is excellent for teething children and also as a tooth cleaner[7, 34]. A tea made from the roots is an excellent thirst quencher[21]. The powdered root is also used as a sweetener in other herb teas[183]. The leaves are used as a tea substitute in Mongolia[183]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Demulcent  Diuretic  Eczema  Emollient  Expectorant  Laxative  Miscellany  Pectoral  Tonic  UrinaryLiquorice his one of the most commonly used herbs in Western herbal medicine and has a very long history of use, both as a medicine and also as a flavouring to disguise the unpleasant flavour of other medications[4]. It is a very sweet, moist, soothing herb that detoxifies and protects the liver[238] and is also powerfully anti-inflammatory, being used in conditions as varied as arthritis and mouth ulcers[254]. The root is alterative, antispasmodic, demulcent, diuretic, emollient, expectorant, laxative, moderately pectoral and tonic[4, 9, 21, 46, 165, 178]. The root has also been shown to have a hormonal effect similar to the ovarian hormone[7]. Liquorice root is much used in cough medicines and also in the treatment of catarrhal infections of the urinary tract[4]. It is taken internally in the treatment of Addison's disease, asthma, bronchitis, coughs, peptic ulcer, arthritis, allergic complaints and following steroidal therapy[238]. It should be used in moderation and should not be prescribed for pregnant women or people with high blood pressure, kidney disease or taking digoxin-based medication[238]. Prolonged usage raises the blood pressure and causes water retention[7, 238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Externally, the root is used in the treatment of herpes, eczema and shingles[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn when 3 - 4 years old and is dried for later use[4, 238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Glycyrrhiza glabra for coughs/bronchitis, gastritis (see [302] for critics of commission E)."
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant yields a substance that is used for etching steel sections in photomicrographic work[171]. Extracts from the root are used as a foaming agent in beers and fire extinguishers[238]. A fibre obtained from the roots is used for insulation, wallboard, boxboard etc[4, 171]. The fibres can be used after the medicinal and flavouring constituents of the root have been removed[4]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep well cultivated fertile moisture-retentive soil for good root production[200]. Prefers a sandy soil with abundant moisture and does not flourish in clay[4]. Slightly alkaline conditions produce the best plants[238]. The plant thrives in a maritime climate[7]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[200]. Liquorice is often cultivated for its edible root which is widely used in medicine and as a flavouring. There are some named varieties[183]. The ssp. glandulifera grows in Russia and produces adventitious roots up to 10 cm thick[142]. Yields of 10 - 12 tonnes per hectare were considered good in the early 20th century, this only being attained in the fourth year of growth[4]. Unless seed is required, the plant is usually prevented from flowering so that it puts more energy into producing good quality roots[238]. The bruised root has a characteristic sweet pungent smell[245]. Plants are slow to settle in and do not produce much growth in their first two years after being moved[4]. The young growth is also very susceptible to damage by slugs and so the plant will require some protection for its first few years[K]. A fairly deep-rooting plant, the roots are up to 120cm long[4]. It can be difficult to eradicate once it is established[238]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 10. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow spring or autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in late spring or early summer when in active growth. Plants are rather slow to grow from seed[238]. Division of the root in spring or autumn. Each division must have at least one growth bud. Autumn divisions can either be replanted immediately or stored in clamps until the spring and then be planted out[200]. It is best to pt up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a cold frame until they are established before planting them out in the spring or summer."
