13,Summary,"Commonly found in tropical Africa, Parinari curatellifolia or commonly known as Mbola or Mobola Plum is an evergreen tree growing about 22m high and 20m across characterized by its mushroom-shaped crown. The branches are heavy and may droop or grow erect. The bole is twisted and can be up to 40cm in diameter. Mbola is used medicinally for toothaches, pneumonia, fever, fractures, wounds, sores, and cuts. The ovoid, yellow fruits have delicious flesh that is somehow comparable to the taste of strawberry. It can be eaten raw, cooked, or processed into juice or jam. The seeds are often roasted, boiled, or grounded into powder. Tannins from the bark are used as a dye in making baskets. Seed oil is used in paint, varnish, soap, etc. Twigs are used as chew sticks. The wood is heavy, durable, hard, and highly resistant to fire but difficult to work. It is used for making furniture, poles, dugout canoes, and mortars. It is also used for fuel and charcoal.",

24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of the tropical and subtropical savannah, growing at elevations of 900 - 1,500 metres in areas with a pronounced dry season[466 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature falls within the range 14 - 30°c, but can tolerate 10 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 400 - 1,000mm, tolerating 100 - 2,700mm[418 ]. Prefers a deep soil in a sunny position[307 ]. Grows best in light soils[335 ]. Often found on light yellowish-brown to reddish-yellow, gritty, sandy clay loams and red to dark red friable clays with lateritic horizon[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, but tolerates 5 - 7.5[418 ]. It can tolerate small concentrations of copper in the soil[418 ]. Dislikes cold winds[418 ]. Trees can be coppiced[325 ]. Because of its resistance to fire it features prominently in fire-maintained wooded grassland, especially in upland areas on the former site of montane forest[308 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it remains viable in normal storage for at least 4 years[325 ]. The seeds should be sown in river sand in flat seed trays. Press the seeds down until they are level with the soil surface and cover with a thin layer of sand. Germination is very poor and prolonged, commencing after about 5 weeks. Seedlings should be transplanted in the 3-leaf stage. Be careful when transplanting the seedlings, the taproot is easily damaged[325 ]. Plant out when about 30cm tall. Root suckers.",
