22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A tree mainly of the sub-tropical zone in eastern Australia, occasionally found further north in the tropical rain forest. Established plants can tolerate some frosts[ 694 ]. Succeeds in full sun once established, but probably requires some shade when smaller. Grows best on richer soils and requires a well-drained soil[ 694 ]. Trees are frustratingly slow-growing when young, but can speed up somewhat and become moderately fast-growing after a few years[ 694 ]. We have no specific information for this species, but most members of the genus are dioecious, in which case both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[ 451 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sown fresh it can germinate within one month[ 694 ].
