Easily grown in light soils[162]. Established plants are drought resistant[190]. A very short-lived plant, it is often only an annual[162], though it often self sows a little[190]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ in March or October and only just cover the seed. Make sure the soil surface does not dry out if the weather is dry. Germination takes place within 2 weeks. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
