Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. This species is considered by some botanists to be no more than a minor variant of L. thuringiaca[187].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination is usually quick and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer[K]. Basal cuttings in spring. Cuttings of softwood in June/July[188].,
