13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prosopis chilensis is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid, very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The seedpods contain a sweet, edible pulp surrounding the seeds[317 ]. They can be used to make a drink[418 ]. The pods are dried and then ground into a powder[303 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree can be grown as a hedge[317 ]. It is also of potential use for soil stabilization and erosion control[414 ]. The typical form of this species is thornless and therefore of interest for breeding of cultivars adapted to arid and semiarid areas[317 ]. Other Uses: A gum is obtained from the stems[317 ]. It has been used as a substitute for gum arabic (from Acacia spp.)[317 ]. The heartwood is reddish-brown to dark brown; the sapwood is pale yellow. The grain is straight; lustre is bright. The wood is fairly dense, durable to very durable. It is easy to saw and plane and is capable of a good finish. It is used for parquet floors, doors, furniture, construction etc[325 , 363 , 414 ]. The wood is excellent for both firewood and charcoal[317 , 414 ]. When burnt, it ignites readily, has a high calorific value, emits intense heat, makes enduring embers and leaves little ash[303 ].  Attracts Birds, Butterflies, Low Water Use. Windbreak. : Pod, Bank.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Pod  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,900 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 30°c, but can tolerate 12 - 45°c[418 ]. The mature tree may tolerate temperatures down to around -5°c for a short duration, but it cannot withstand repeated frosts and young growth can be killed at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 300 - 500mm, but tolerates 200 - 600mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position. Succeeds in shallow soils of low fertility and in saline soils[303 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5, tolerating 6 - 8.5[418 ]. Established plants can withstand 8 - 11 months of annual drought[418 ]. An aggressive plant, it may easily become a weed[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it remains viable for several years in normal storage[325 ]. The seeds are hardcoated and must be scarified in order to germinate. Burning, nicking and immersion in boiling water are some of the methods that can be used. If the seeds are not extracted from the pods before sowing, they will normally require several minutes of boiling to overcome dormancy. Normally the seeds are sown directly in containers. Germination starts after 2 weeks and continues for up to one month. When the plants are 30 - 35cm tall they are ready for planting in the field[325 ]. Direct seeding is also possible[325 ].",
