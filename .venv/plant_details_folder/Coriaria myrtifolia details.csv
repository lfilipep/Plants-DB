22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fairly good loamy soil in a sunny sheltered position[11, 200]. Succeeds in light shade[200]. Plants are hardy to about -5°c, succeeding outdoors in Britain from London and south-westwards[11, 200]. The stems are often cut back by winter cold but the plants usually resprout from the base. This new growth does not flower in its first year[182]. The roots of plants in this genus bear nitrogen-fixing nodules[218]. Whilst much of the nitrogen will be utilized by the growing plant, some of it will become available for other plants growing nearby[K]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in a greenhouse[78]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair percentage[78]."
