0,Mertensia maritima,Oyster Plant,Boraginaceae,3-7,None known,Shingle by the sea[17]. Uncommon and declining[200].,"Throughout the temperate regions of both hemispheres, including Britain.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MertensiaMaritima.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MertensiaMaritima2.jpg",,"Mertensia maritima is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects? Self. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",Pulmonaria maritima.,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[172, 183]. They are said to taste of oysters[5]. No-one has yet noticed a resemblance to oysters though not many of the tasters have ever eaten oysters! The flavour is fairly bland, the leaf is thick and has a very mucilaginous texture - it is probably this texture that reminds people of oysters[K]. Root[22, 46, 61, 105]. Eaten by the Inuit of Alaska[183, 257]. Flowers - raw[172].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Thrives in nutritionally poor sandy or gravelly soils in a sunny position[200]. Requires a very well-drained soil[188]. Dislikes shade[233]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. This species is not very easy to cultivate[1]. Plants are very susceptible to slug damage[188, K] The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Spring sown seed is also successful[K]. Germination usually takes place within a month. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in April or early September. With care since the plant resents root disturbance.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
