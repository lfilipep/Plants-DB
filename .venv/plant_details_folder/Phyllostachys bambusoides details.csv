13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Phyllostachys bambusoides is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 8 m (26ft) by 8 m (26ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked as a vegetable[25, 46, 105]. Large but somewhat acrid when raw[61], they require boiling in a lot of water or in several changes of water[183]. The shoots are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level. The shoots contain about 2.1% protein, 0.3% fat, 3.2% carbohydrate, 0.9% ash[179].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AntipyreticThe leaves are antipyretic[218]. New shoots are used in the treatment of haematuria[218].,
22,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant has an extensive root system and is used for erosion control. The stems are used for making furniture, plant supports etc[46, 61, 74]. Fairly thick walled, the canes are considered to be the most versatile of this genus and are used in construction and other industrial uses[195]. Splints made from the stems are good for weaving various bamboo articles[266]. Even the dead culms are durable[195].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: MultistrataRequires a rich loamy soil and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1] plus a sheltered position[200]. A very hardy plant[11, 25], tolerating temperatures down to about -18°c, but it dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. Plants can reach 25 metres in height in their native habitat, they are much smaller in Britain but, even so, a height of 12 metres has been recorded in Cornwall. Cultivated for its edible shoots in China[183], it is the most widely grown bamboo in Japan for its useful canes[195]. It has been widely planted for ornament in the Mediterranean and is becoming naturalized there[50]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Castillon' has smaller culms than the species type, the edible shoots are less bitter[195]. A plant of this cultivar at Trebah gardens in Cornwall was growing well in woodland shade, it was 5 metres tall with canes 20mm in diameter[K]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. The rootstock is running but not aggressively so, especially in the cooler climate of Britain[25]. New shoots are produced from late May[25]. Individual stems can be long lived, staying leafy for up to 20 years[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of several years, viable seed is usually produced[122]. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They usually die after flowering, but if left alone they will sometimes recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring.",
