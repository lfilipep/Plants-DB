13,Summary,"A woody shrub that reaches only up to 4 m high upon maturity, Pigeon Pea or Cajanus cajan is grown in the tropics and subtropics for various uses. It is short-lived and believed to be one of the earliest of cultivated plants. It has deep tap roots hence it can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Edible parts of pigeon pea are the seeds, seedpods, leaves, and young shoots. Pigeon pea is as well known for its medicinal uses. Leaves are used as treatment of coughs, bronchitis, diarrhoea, haemorrhages, sores, and wounds. Diabetes and sore throats can likewise be treated using other plant parts of pigeon pea. Pigeon pea is planted as green manure. The stems are used as material in making baskets and in thatching. The wood is used in light construction."

23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: A good green manure crop[ 46 , 200 ]. The plant has an extensive root system and is often grown to bind soil[ 200 , 320 ]. It is also grown to provide shelter from the wind[ 320 ]. It is also grown as a shade crop, cover crop, or as support for vanilla[ 299 ]. Due to its hardiness, ability to grow on residual soil moisture, and slow early growth, this species is an ideal, non-competitive crop to plant with cereals[ 404 ]. For hedgerow intercropping, the hedges should be cut at height of 50 - 100cm when the grain crop is fully mature. The hedges can be cut 2 - 3 times a year in areas where the dry season lasts 4 - 6 months. At pod maturity, the branches are cut at about 50cm. Higher levels of pruning can result in higher and unacceptable levels of plant mortality[ 303 ]. The root system is reported to break plough pans, thus improving soil structure, encouraging infiltration, minimizing sedimentation and smothering weeds. Leaf fall at maturity adds to the organic matter in the soil and provides additional nitrogen. It seems to have special mechanisms to extract phosphorus from black Vertisol soils[ 303 ]. The plant improves the soil through its extensive root system, nitrogen fixation and the mulch provided by the fallen leaves. Other Uses The stems are of use in basketry and thatching[ 200 ]. The plants are often used as brooms[ 272 ]. An essential oil can be collected by the steam distillation of the leaves and other aerial organs. It contains a mixture of compounds including the terpenoid alpha - copaene[ 404 ]. The macerated leaves are used as a deodorant[ 348 ]. The wood is used in light construction such as in roofing, wattling on carts, tubular wickerwork lining for wells and baskets[ 303 ]. The dried stalks and branches are used for fuel[ 320 ]. The sticks are an important household fuel in many areas. The heat value, with 1,450 kJ per 100g, is about half as high as the same weight of coal[ 303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Insect: Plants grown for useful fodder insects.,Global Crop as Annual: These crops are already grown or traded around the world. The annual value of each is more than $1 billion US.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Perennial Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers.,Other Systems: Homegarden: Tropical multistrata agroforestry (multi-story combinations of trees, crops, domestic animals in the homestead).,Other Systems: Perennial fallow: Land that is plowed and tilled but left unseeded during a growing season.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."

Plants generally prefer a rainfall in the region of 500 - 1,000mm per year, though there are some cultivars that are adapted to wet, humid tropics so long as the soil is well drained[ 300 ]. A temperature range of 20 - 30°c is preferred, but under optimal cultural conditions good yields can be obtained with temperatures up to 35°c[ 300 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[ 320 ]. Succeeds in a wide range of soils that are well-drained[ 300 ]. Plants produce deep tap roots, they can succeed in poor soils and are extremely drought resistant once established[ 298 , 300 ]. Dislikes very acid soils, growing best in a pH range of 5.5 - 6.5[ 300 ]. A short-lived, woody plant, dying after 1 - 5 years[ 404 ]. Harvesting of dwarf varieties can commence 5 months after sowing (8 - 12 months for taller varieties) and continue for several months[ 300 ]. A relatively low-yielding crop, yields of up to 5 tonnes per hectare of pods, or 1 tonne of seeds can be achieved[ 300 , 404 ]. In perennial crops, 2 - 10 tonnes per hectare a year of woody stalks can be harvested for fuel[ 404 ]. There are two main forms of this plant, and many named varieties of each[ 46 , 300 , 301 ]. Var. Flavus DC. Is a moderate height plant that is early maturing, it is often grown as an annual in India[ 300 ]. The green pods normally contain 3 seeds[ 300 ]. Var. Bicolor DC. Is a taller plant that is later to mature and is usually grown as a perennial[ 300 ]. The dark coloured pods contain 4 - 5 seeds[ 300 ]. Short-duration dwarf cultivars are usually daylength neutral, but the taller growing cultivars are usually short-day plants that will not readily flower if day length is 12 hours or more[ 300 ]. A good companion plant, it is often grown in association with other crops[ 300 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 200 ]. The crop is cultivated on marginal land by resource-poor farmers, who commonly grow traditional medium- and long-duration (5-11 months) landraces."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ during the wet season, placing the seed 2 - 3 cm deep in the soil[ 300 ]. Two seeds are often planted per station, thinning to the best plant[ 300 ]. The seeds germinate at temperatures of 19 - 43°c, but most rapidly at 20 - 30°c. Emergence is complete 2 - 3 weeks after sowing. Vegetative development starts slowly, but after 2 - 3 months growth accelerates[ 299 ]."
