24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. See the plants native habitat for ideas on its cultivation needs."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if they are large enough. Otherwise, grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year. A sowing in situ would also be worth trying."
