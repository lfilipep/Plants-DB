24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this plant and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. Going by its native habitat it should be very wind resistant and probably requires a light to medium well-drained soil in a sunny position. Is this the same plant that is listed as A. tuberosa. Cav. in [46] and [61]??"
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
