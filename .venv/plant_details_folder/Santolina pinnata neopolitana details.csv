21,Other Uses Description,Can be grown as a low formal hedge and used as an edging plant[200]. The plant is very tolerant of shearing[200]. The cultivar 'Edward Bowles' is often used[29]. They are best spaced about 75cm apart each way[208].
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Does not require a rich soil and dislikes wet conditions around the roots[200]. Prefers a light sandy soil in full sun[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200], growing well in a hot dry soil[190]. Tolerates salt-laden winds[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[184]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[29, 200]. The flowers smell vile[190], rather like perspiration[245]. The foliage is most aromatic[245]. Tolerates shearing so long as this is not done at times of low resistance (winter?)[200]. Plants can be cut back hard in spring to maintain their form[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Does not require pre-treatment[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, 5 - 8 cm, July/August in a frame. Roots within 2 weeks. High percentage[78]. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Layering."
