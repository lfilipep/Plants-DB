13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Dipterocarpus kerrii is an evergreen Tree growing to 40 m (131ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The oleo-resins obtained from the tree are used in analgesic liniments[373 ].,
20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"An oleoresin is obtained by tapping the tree[373 ]. It is commonly used by local people for caulking boats; making torches, coating wood as a protection against weather; etc[46 , 373 ]. The resin is obtained by cutting a hole in the trunk near the base (about 90 - 150cm from the ground) and then dipping out the resin with a spoon as it collects there. To prolong the flow, a fire made from dead leaves or brushwood is made in the hole at intervals - this burns off the dried resinous film and allows the resin to flow again[64 , 146 ]. An essential oil can be distilled from the resin[373 ]. It is used as a fixative in perfumery and for scenting soaps[373 ]. The tree is a source of keruing timber[884 ]. We have no specific information on the wood, but the general description of keruing timber is as follows:- The heartwood is light red to red brown or purplish red brown; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 7cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain straight or interlocked. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; moderately hard; somewhat durable, being resistant to dry wood borers, fairly resistant to fungi but susceptible to termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable to moderately stable in service. It has a high blunting effect on tools due to the presence of silica, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; some species are very resinous and can clog tools; there is occasional tearing on quartersawn wood; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct, but care is required because of the resin. A general construction timber, it is used in carpentry, panelling, joinery, floors, timber frame houses, boxes and crates, veneer etc[848 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Wild Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Wild CropYoung trees grow best in the shade of the forest, but become increasingly light-demanding as they grow larger[418 ]. Members of this genus generally only regenerate naturally in the shade of the forest. Seedlings and saplings can persist in dense forest shade for many years. In their first 2 years the young plants cannot tolerate major openings in the canopy, but after they are well established (about 120cm tall) the canopy can be opened up around them to speed up their growth[404 ].",
