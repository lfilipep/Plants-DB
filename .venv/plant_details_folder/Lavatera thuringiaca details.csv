18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves - raw or cooked. A mild flavour, but the leaves are tough and not very worthwhile[K]. Leaves of the cultivar 'Barnsley' are less tough and are reasonably tasty, a plant at Kew had also produced quite a few leaves in the winter and so it is a potential winter salad[K]. Flowers - raw. A pleasant mild flavour, they make a decorative addition to the salad bowl[K]. Many named cultivars have considerably larger flowers than the type species and are thus much more worthwhile for the salad bowl[K]."

22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"A strong fibre is obtained from the stems, it is used for making string, bags, paper etc[74]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a light well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. A soil that is too rich encourages foliar growth at the expense of flowering[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[200]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. There are many named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The cultivar 'Barnsley' usually produces new shoots from the base in the autumn and winter. It is therefore a potential winter salad plant, though the texture of the leaves is not that wonderful[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination is usually quick and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer[K]. Basal cuttings in spring. Cuttings of softwood in June/July[188].
