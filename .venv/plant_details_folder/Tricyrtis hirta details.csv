Prefers a humus-rich fertile well-drained but moisture-retentive acid or neutral light sandy loam in partial shade[175, 200]. Prefers the dappled shade of a woodland garden but tolerates full sun if the soil is reliably moist throughout the growing season, flowering earlier in such a position[200]. Plants also require a sunnier position in the northern parts of Britain[233]. This species is hardy to about -20°c, but if prolonged cold weather is not accompanied by snow cover the plants will appreciate a good mulch of organic matter[187]. Plants are very susceptible to attacks by slugs[175]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed requires 12 weeks stratification at 5°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division just before growth starts in spring to single crowns[175]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
