13,Summary,"Brazilian orchard tree - Bauhinia forficata, is a fast-growing, pioneer species. It is a spiny, deciduous or semi-deciduous tree that grows up to 5-9m tall. It has an open and irregular crown and a usually crooked bole up to 30-40cm in diameter. It has a nitrogen-fixing capacity. The leaf of Brazilian orchid tree has been known as remedy for diabetes. It is also an anticholesterolemic , blood purifier, diuretic, hypoglycaemic, and tonic. The wood is soft and moderately heavy, and used for fuel and charcoal making."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Bauhinia forficata is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is not frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves (see medicinal uses). An infusion of the leaves is drunk regularly after meals for its health benefits, whilst it is also drunk specifically in the treatment of diabetes, high blood sugar levels, kidney and urinary disorders, to reduce blood cholesterol levels and as a general tonic and blood purifier[ 318 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Leprosy: Used to treat leprosy - a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and superficial nerves (in the skin) caused by Mycobacterium leprae.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI)."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Anticholesterolemic  Antidiarrhoeal  Blood purifier  Diuretic  Hypoglycaemic  Kidney  Leprosy  Skin  Tonic  UrinaryBrazilian orchid tree leaf has become very popular as a treatment for diabetes ever since research carried out in the 1920's demonstrated its ability to reduce blood sugar levels. The leaves contain a range of compounds including flavonoids, alkaloids, and glycosides. Various trials have been carried out into the health benefits of the leaves, particularly the hypoglycaemic activity. Whilst most of these trials have been positive, at least one was unable to discern positive benefits[ 318 , 739 ]. The main plant compounds in the plant include astragalin, bauhinoside, beta-sitosterol, flavonols, flavonoids, glycosides, guanidine, heteroglycosides, kaempferitrin, organic acids, quercitrosides, rhamnose, and saponins[ 318 ]. Astragalin has well-proven antibacterial activity[ 318 ]. Kaempferitrin, a flavonoid, has been shown to significantly lower blood sugar levels, to have diuretic activity and to help repair kidney cell damage[ 318 ]. The leaves are anticholesterolemic, blood purifier, diuretic, hypoglycaemic and tonic[ 318 , 739 ]. An infusion is drunk regularly after meals for its health benefits, whilst it is also drunk specifically in the treatment of diabetes, high blood sugar levels, kidney and urinary disorders, to reduce blood cholesterol levels and as a general tonic and blood purifier[ 318 ]. Other conditions that have been treated with the leaves include central nervous system disorders, diarrhoea, elephantiasis, intestinal worms, leprosy, obesity, skin disorders, snakebite and syphilis[ 318 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing, pioneer species that also fix atmospheric nitrogen (some disagreement - see Cultivation below), it can be used in reforestation projects and, with its small size and fairly open crown, is suitable for use in the first stages of a woodland garden[ 419 , K ]. Other Uses The wood is moderately heavy, soft, of low durability when exposed to the elements. Too small and of low quality for applications other than making lightboxes, light workmanship etc[ 419 ]. Whole trunks and branches are used for fuel and to make charcoal[ 419 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Brazilian orchid tree is found from the subtropical to the tropical zones. Prefers a sunny position[ 419 ]. Succeeds in a range of soils so long as they are well-drained[ 309 ]. Tolerant of acidic soils[ 309 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[ 309 ]. A fast-growing young plant, able to reach a height of 3.5 metres within 2 years from seed[ 419 ]. The wood can be rather weak, leading to branches breaking[ 309 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[ 755 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Seed the seed in a partially shaded position in individual containers. A germination rate of around 30% can be expected from untreated seeds, with the seed sprouting within 15 - 25 days[ 419 ]. They should be ready to plant out less than 6 months later. Cuttings. Layering. Suckers."
