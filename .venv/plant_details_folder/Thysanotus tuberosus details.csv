24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a fertile well-drained sandy loan in a sunny position[1, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, usually requiring greenhouse protection in this country. It tolerates temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Most, if not all, members of this genus have edible roots[193]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow thinly in spring in a sandy compost in a greenhouse[200]. Grow the seedlings on in the pot for their first growing season and pot them on into individual pots in early spring of the following year. Grow them on for at least another year in a greenhouse before trying them outdoors. Division.
