While protoanemonin can cause severe topical and gastrointestinal irritation, it is unstable and changes into harmless anemonin when plants are dried or heated[4, 10, 19, 65, 270]. An extremely acrid plant, even small doses causing a great disturbance of the stomach[207].",

23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil but prefers a moist well-drained woodland soil[1, 200]. Prefers a moist peaty soil in some shade[187]. Tolerates drought during its summer dormancy[200]. Hardy to at least -20°c[187]. This species is very closely related to A . grayi , A . lancifolia , A . lyallii , A . oregana , and A . Piperi. This species complex also shares close morphologic affinities with both European species such as A . nemorosa and Asian species such as A . Altaica[270] Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. A good woodland plant[1, 187].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the summer[1]. Surface sow or only just cover the seed and keep the soil moist. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in late winter or early spring. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first year. When the plants are large enough, plant them out in the spring. Division in late summer after the plant dies down.",
