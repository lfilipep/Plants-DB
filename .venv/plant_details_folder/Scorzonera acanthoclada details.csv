24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in any soil in sun or light shade[200]. Plants are probably adaptable to the British climate[141]. Plants usually regenerate from the root after they have been harvested[110].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in the greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into relatively deep pots to accommodate the tap root. If growth is good, plant out in early summer, other wise grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Division in autumn or as growth commences in the spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Root cuttings in the autumn.",
