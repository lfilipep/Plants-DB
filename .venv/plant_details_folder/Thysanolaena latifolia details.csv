In the Philippines a very characteristic, light dust broom is made of the panicles of this grass[345 ]. These brooms are extensively used for sweeping the highly polished hardwood floors so characteristic of the better houses in the Philippines. The panicles of this species are considered to make the best grade of these brooms, and for this purpose they are gathered extensively in some parts of the Islands. The handles of the brooms are made of the flowering stems variously interwoven or bound together, the panicles being arranged in a fan-like fashion to form the broom itself.
