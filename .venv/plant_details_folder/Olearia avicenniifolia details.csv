17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world. The annual value of each is more than $1 billion US Examples include coconuts, almonds, and bananas.,Other Systems: Irreg. Intercrop: Irregular intercropping systems are trees scattered throughout cropland.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Other Systems: Woody agriculture: Domesticated woody plants intensively producing agricultural staples.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",

23,Other Uses Description,"Very resistant to maritime exposure and tolerant of severe pruning[11, 49, 166, 200], this plant can be used as an effective windbreak hedge in exposed maritime areas[75]. It is rather slow growing though[75].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[182, 200]. Thrives in a chalky soil[182] but prefers a light loam or peaty soil[11]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure[11, 75]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. This species is not very hardy outside the milder western and south-western maritime areas of Britain[1], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. Another report says that it is hardy to about -15°c[200]. Very slow growing in Britain[75], the plants generally only reach 2 - 3 metres tall in cultivation in this country. Plants can be pruned right back into old wood in order to promote fresh growth[200]. Any pruning is best done in the spring[11]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Flowers best in years following long hot summers[200]. The flowers are sweetly scented[184].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in early spring in a greenhouse. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. If growth has been sufficiently good, plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, otherwise grow them on for another year in pots and plant them out the following early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in late August and overwinter in a cold frame then plant out in late spring or early summer[78]. Good percentage[11]. Cuttings of moderately ripe wood of the current years growth, 5 - 10cm with a heel, November in a frame. High percentage[78].",
