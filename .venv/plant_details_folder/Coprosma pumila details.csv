The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist, very well-drained neutral to slightly acid soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Prefers a permanent moist and peaty soil, but it is not an easy plant to grow in Britain[225]. Somewhat intolerant of frost, this species is only likely to succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[200]. Another report says that it is fully hardy in Britain[225]. Closely related to C. atropurpurea and often confused with that species[225]. It is a very variable plant, hybridizing freely with other members of this genus[200, 225]. Plants are normally dioecious, though in some species the plants produce a few flowers of the opposite sex before the main flowering and a few hermaphrodite flowers are sometimes produced[225]. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required. There is some confusion over the correct name of this species, it could be a part of C. petriei[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse or cold frame[K]. Sow stored seed in spring in a cold frame[200]. Germination can be slow, often taking more than 12 months even when fresh seed is used[K]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame.",
