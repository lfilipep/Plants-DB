When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. If planting them outdoors, do this in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of green wood, spring in a frame."
