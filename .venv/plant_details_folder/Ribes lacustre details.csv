When crushed the fruit has a foul odour[43] but when eaten by the handful the odour is inoffensive (this sounds a bit strange!) and when cooked they make a good sauce[183]. The fruit can also be dried for later use or used to make jams and preserves[257]. The fruit is about 5mm in diameter[200] and is covered with weak gland-tipped bristles[235]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. Plants are quite tolerant of shade though do not fruit so well in such a position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. Although this plant has spines, it belongs to the blackcurrant section of the genus[101]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so they should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 4 - 6 months cold stratification at about 0°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200]."
