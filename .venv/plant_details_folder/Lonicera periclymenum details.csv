21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Astringent  Cathartic  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Laxative  Mouthwash  Skin  VulneraryThe plant has expectorant and laxative properties[4]. A syrup made from the flowers has been used in the treatment of respiratory diseases whilst a decoction of the leaves is considered beneficial in treating diseases of the liver and spleen[4]. It is used as a mouthwash for ulcers[66] and is considered to be a good ingredient in gargles[4]. The flowers are antispasmodic, astringent, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge and sudorific[240].

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"A climbing plant, it can be allowed to scramble on the ground where it makes a good ground cover[208]. Plants should be spaced about 1.2 metres apart each way[208]. A very good moth and butterfly plant[30], it is also an important food for many caterpillars including the larvae of the rare white admiral butterfly[186]. The dense growth of the plant offers good nesting possibilities for birds[186]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils from acid to base-rich[186]. Prefers its roots in the shade with its shoots climbing up into the sun[200]. Plants succeed even in quite deep shade[219]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are a number of named varieties[184]. The flowers are very fragrant, especially in the evening when it attracts pollinating moths[186, 245]. New leaves often start to open in January with well-grown leaves in April[186]. The leaves fall in November[186]. Twining plants, they can bind themselves so tightly round young trees that they can prevent the trunk from being able to expand[186]. A very good moth and butterfly plant[30], it is also an important food for many caterpillars including the larvae of the rare white admiral butterfly[186]. The dense growth of the plant offers good nesting possibilities for birds[186]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn[200]."
