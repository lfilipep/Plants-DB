See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - roasted[46, 61, 63, 105, 183, 266].

The wood is used in constructing buildings, bridges, and furniture[266].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilSucceeds in ordinary garden soil, tolerating some lime[1]. Requires a sheltered position and either high humidity or a moist riverside soil[200]. Dislikes wind exposure[200]. Tolerates woodland shade very well[200]. Requires hot, very humid summers for best growth[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it only succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[1]. It succeeds outdoors at Kew[11], a tree was 8 metres tall in 1970[185]. The seed takes two summers to mature[229]. The edible seed of this very ornamental evergreen tree is often sold in local markets in China. Closely related to T. nucifera[200]. Plants are dioecious so both male and female plants are required if seed is to be produced. Occasional trees are monoecious with dioecious branches.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some of the seed should germinate in the following spring though much of it might take another 12 months. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and can take 18 months or more to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as growth is observed and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least the next couple of winters, making sure to pot them on into larger pots as and when required. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer when the plants are at least 20cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots in late summer[1]. Cuttings do not grow well[11].
