Plants spread quickly to form thickets in sunny woody areas.The fruit is deliciously spicy and sweet; they can be eaten out of hand or used in pies, preserves etc. They can also be dried for later use. The dried fruit can be ground into a powder then mixed with cereal flours to make bread. The fruit is somewhat seedy. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter.

The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",G. resinosa. Andromeda baccata.

Plants are hardy to about -15°c[200]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties selected for their larger fruits[22, 46]. The small oval leaves are covered with globules on the underside from which a resinous gum is exuded[245]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Seeds are short-lived and difficult to germinate.  Stored seed requires 1 month warm stratification followed by 2 months cold[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots of lime-free compost and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Layering.
