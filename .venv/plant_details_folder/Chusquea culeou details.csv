Prefers an open loam of reasonable quality, doing well on peat[11]. Likes plenty of moisture in the growing season[11]. Established plants are drought tolerant[25, 162, 195]. They require a position sheltered from cold north and east winds[11, 200]. A very hardy plant[25, 162], tolerating temperatures down to about -15°c[200]. Another report says that the plant is probably only hardy in the milder areas of the country[1]. It succeeds outdoors at Edinburgh Botanical Gardens[195] and is growing well at Kew[K]. This species is found further south in the world than any other species of bamboo, it grows in Chile as far south as latitude 47°south[195]. The rootstock is caespitose, new shoots are produced from late April and can grow 15cm overnight[25]. Plants take 2 - 3 years to settle down after being moved but are then quite fast growing[162]. Another report says that they are slow growing[188]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants flower and produce seed annually in the wild without dying as a result of the flowering[162]. Plants of the cultivar 'Tenuis' have been observed to be flowering in 1994, this is the first record of this species flowering in the northern hemisphere[214].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Very difficult[200]. Take divisions with at least four canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].
