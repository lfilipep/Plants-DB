In Australian gardens it succeeds in most soils in a warm sunny position. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in any ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a light well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. A soil that is too rich encourages foliar growth at the expense of flowering[200].
