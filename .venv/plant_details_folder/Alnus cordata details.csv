13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Alnus cordata is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf from April to December, in flower in March. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

20,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc."
21,Other Uses Description,"An excellent windbreak for maritime areas[75], it grows quite quickly and establishes well even in very windy sites[K]. Trees 5 years old from seed have reached 4 metres in height and are showing no signs of wind-shaping in a very exposed site in Cornwall[K]. This is an excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil. Alder seedlings do not compete well in shady woodland conditions and so this species gradually dies out as the other trees become established[K]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives on poor and dryish soils, even on chalk, but prefers to be near water[11, 200]. Prefers a heavy soil and a damp situation[1, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates very infertile sites[11, 200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it is very fast growing, reaching 12 metres tall in 20 years in an exposed maritime position at Rosewarne in N. Cornwall[75]. Very tolerant of salt winds, it establishes rapidly in exposed positions[75]. According to World Economic Plants, the correct author of this species is (Loisel.)Loisel. and not Desf. as we have given here. However, since all our other sources have quoted Desf., we have decided not to alter it at this time (1999)[K]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe and only just covered[200]. Spring sown seed should also germinate successfully so long as it is not covered[200, K]. The seed should germinate in the spring as the weather warms up. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. If growth is sufficient, it is possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in pots outdoors and plant them out in the spring. If you have sufficient quantity of seed, it can be sown thinly in an outdoor seed bed in the spring[78]. The seedlings can either be planted out into their permanent positions in the autumn/winter, or they can be allowed to grow on in the seed bed for a further season before planting them. Cuttings of mature wood, taken as soon as the leaves fall in autumn, outdoors in sandy soil."
