13,Summary,"Form: Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Juniperus sabina is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Irritant: Causes irritation or abnormal sensitivity in living tissue.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Warts: Used in the treatment of warts, corns etc.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Diuretic  Emetic  Emmenagogue  Irritant  Parasiticide  WartsThe young shoots are abortifacient, diuretic, emetic, powerfully emmenagogue and irritant[4, 7]. The plant is rarely used internally but is useful as an ointment and dressing to blisters etc in order to promote discharge[4]. The powdered leaves are also used in the treatment of warts[1, 4, 7, 21]. The shoots are harvested in spring and dried for later use[4]. Use with great caution and never during pregnancy[4, 21], see notes above on toxicity.",
20,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Leaves are used as an insect repellent, a decoction of them is used against lice[46, 61]. An essential oil from the leaves and shoots has strong diuretic properties and is also used in perfumery[1, 61]. Yields of around 4% are obtained, this oil is also used as an insecticide[7]. A good dense ground cover plant, though it is slow to cover the ground[197]. The species type eventually forms a high ground cover, but there are many named forms that are lower-growing[208]. The sub-species J. sabina tamariscifolia has been particularly recommended[188]. Plants should be spaced about 1.2 metres apart each way[208]. The taller forms of this species make a good hedge[245].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[1, 11]. Prefers a limestone soil[1]. Succeeds in poor soils and in light shade[197]. Established plants are drought tolerant, succeeding in hot dry positions[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[188]. All parts of the plant have a powerful pungent smell[245]. Plants can be dioecious or monoecious. Male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed are required. The plant is sometimes attacked by a rust, this is a fungus with an aecidial stage on the leaves of pear trees[1]. Plants are resistant to honey fungus[88]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",
