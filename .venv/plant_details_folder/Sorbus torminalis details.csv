0,Sorbus torminalis,"Wild Service Tree, Checkertree",Rosaceae,5-9,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Woods, usually on clay[186], sometimes on limestone[17].","Europe, from Britain and Denmark south and east to N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Crataegus torminalis. Pyrus torminalis.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 5, 11, 74, 115, 183]. The taste is best after a frost because it turns sweeter. The fruit can also be bletted if it is going to be eaten raw[3, 183]. This involves storing the fruit in a cool dry place until it is almost but not quite going rotten. At this stage the fruit has a delicious taste, somewhat like a luscious tropical fruit. Rich in vitamin C. The fruit is up to 1.5cm across[200] and is borne in bunches which makes it easier to harvest[K].","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Tolerates moderate shade[188], but does not fruit so well in such a position[K]. Grows best in the eastern half of Britain[121]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188]. Plants respond well to coppicing[186]. When found in a truly wild situation this species is considered to be an indication of primary woodland[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
