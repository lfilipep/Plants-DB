Plants grow better if given some shade around midday[200]. Prefers a well-drained calcareous or neutral soil[214] and is drought tolerant when established[190]. Another report says that it dislikes dry summer soils[200]. Dislikes winter wet[200]. Prefers a sheltered position[214]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c, tolerating even lower temperatures if the roots are well mulched, preferably with dry bracken[1, 187, 200]. The crown of the plant requires protection from slugs in the winter[187]. A very ornamental plant, it usually takes about 3 - 4 years to come into flower from seed[214]. This species is often confused in cultivation with I. mairei[214]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance, it is best to place them in their permanent positions whilst small[200]. The plants will often sulk for several years if they are divided[214]. Special Features:Attractive foliage."
