See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Leaves - raw[2, 27, 37]. A hot watercress flavour[183]. The leaves are very nice in small quantities on their own or as a flavouring in mixed salads, they are available from early summer until the first frosts of the autumn[K]. Flowers - raw[2, 27, 37, 183]. A very ornamental and tasty addition to the salad bowl, the flowers have a hot watercress flavour[7]. The flowers contain about 130mg vitamin C per 100g[218]. Young seed pods - raw[2, 27, 37]. These are even hotter than the flowers or leaves[K]. The seed pods can also be harvested whilst immature and pickled for use as a caper substitute[183]. Seed - raw or cooked. Very hot[K]. The mature seed can be ground into a powder and used as a pepper substitute[183].","Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibiotic  Antiseptic  Aperient  Diuretic  Expectorant  Vitamin CThe whole plant is antibiotic, antiseptic, aperient, diuretic and expectorant[7, 21]. It is useful in breaking up congestion in the respiratory passages and chest during colds[21]. The juice or tea can be used as an external or internal antiseptic[21]. The plant has antibiotic properties towards aerobic spore forming bacteria[61], it is also said to have a beneficial effect on the blood by promoting the formation of blood cells[21].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The growing plant attracts aphids away from other plants. Research indicates that aphids flying over plants with orange or yellow flowers do not stop, nor do they prey on plants growing next to or above the flowers[201]. An insecticide can be made from an infusion of leaves and soap flakes[201].",,"Prefers a rich light well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade[37]. More and lusher leaves are produced when the plant is growing in a rich soil, though less flowers are produced[238]. When grown in a soil of low fertility the leaves are smaller and less lush, though more flowers are produced[200, K] The plant will also succeed in very poor soils[202]. Dislikes drought[37]. This species is not frost hardy in Britain but it is often grown in the flower garden as an annual when it will frequently self-sow[37]. In cold springs, however, the seed will often not germinate until mid or even late summer, which is too late to produce a reasonable crop[K]. There are some named varieties[183]. Grows well with radishes, cabbages and fruit trees, improving their growth and flavour[14, 20]. A good companion for many plants, keeping many harmful insects at bay and also improving the growth and flavour of neighbouring crops[201]. Aphids on nasturtiums indicate a lime deficiency in the soil[20]. Slugs and snails love eating this plant, so it can be grown to attract them away from other plants[201]. The caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly can be a nuisance and often cause considerable damage to the leaves[219].",Seed - sow April in situ. The seed usually germinates within 2 weeks. Seed can also be sown in March in pots in a greenhouse and planted out in late spring or early summer.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
