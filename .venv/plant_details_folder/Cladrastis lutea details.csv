It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. tinctoria.

A clear yellow dye is obtained from the heartwood[46, 61, 82].  - is relatively heavy, very hard, strong, close-grained, durable and takes a beautiful polish[11, 46, 61, 82, 229]. It weighs 39lb per cubic foot[235] and is a good fuel[82].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a rich well-drained loamy soil in a very sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerates slightly acid to very alkaline soils[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], when dormant it is hardy to -30°c or lower[200]. However, plants can be excited into early spring growth in the mild climate of Britain and that growth is very susceptible to frost damage[200]. A slow-growing but moderately long-lived tree in the wild[229]. The branches are brittle and can be broken off in strong winds[188, 200]. The plants contain a copious watery sap and can bleed profusely if they are pruned in winter or spring[82, 200]. Any pruning is best done in late summer[200]. This species often only flowers in alternate years in the wild[82]. The flowers are produced most freely after a long hot summer[200]. The flowers have a soft scent of vanilla[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water and then sown in a greenhouse in late winter[78, 164, 200]. Three months cold stratification at 5°c can reduce the germination time[200]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 10°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings, 5 - 7cm long, December in a greenhouse.
