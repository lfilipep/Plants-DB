1,Common Name,Mountain Bladder Fern
2,Family,Dryopteridaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]."
5,Habitats,"Damp, usually basic, rocks on mountains, 700 - 1100 metres in Northern England and Scotland[17]."
6,Range,"Northern, but not arctic, Europe, including Britain, east to Siberia. Also in northern N. America."
