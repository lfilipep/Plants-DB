Likes plenty of moisture whilst in growth followed by a warm dry period in late summer and autumn[200]. Succeeds outdoors in a very sheltered warm position. Plants grow in patches in the wild and these can cover considerable areas[212].

The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. Ephemeral emerging in spring and dying back by summer every year  [1-2]. The root pattern is a corm swelling at the stem base [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Alternatively, the seed can be sown in spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c. Sow the seed thinly so that there is no need to prick them out and grow the seedlings on in the pot for their first year. Give an occasional liquid feed to ensure that they do not become mineral deficient. Seedlings are prone to damping off so be careful not to overwater them and keep them well ventilated. When they become dormant, pot up the small bulbs placing about 3 in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for another year or two until the bulbs are about 20mm in diameter and then plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant in the autumn. Division of flowering size bulbs in autumn. Dig up the clumps of bulbs, replanting the larger ones direct into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up the smaller ones and grow them on in a greenhouse for a year before planting them out when they are dormant in early autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
