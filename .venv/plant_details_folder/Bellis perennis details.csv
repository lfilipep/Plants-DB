Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antidiarrhoeal  Antispasmodic  Antitussive  Cancer  Demulcent  Digestive  Eczema  Emollient  Expectorant  Laxative  Ophthalmic  Purgative  TonicDaisies are a popular domestic remedy with a wide range of applications[7]. They are a traditional wound herb[238] and are also said to be especially useful in treating delicate and listless children[7]. Recent research (1994) has been looking at the possibility of using the plant in HIV therapy[238]. The herb is mildly anodyne, antispasmodic, antitussive, demulcent, digestive, emollient, expectorant, laxative, ophthalmic, purgative and tonic[7, 9, 21]. The fresh or dried flowering heads are normally used[9]. An infusion is used in the treatment of catarrh, rheumatism, arthritis, liver and kidney disorders, as a blood purifier etc[9]. The daisy once had a great reputation as a cure for fresh wounds[4]. An ointment made from the leaves is applied externally to wounds, bruises etc[4, 232] whilst a distilled water is used internally to treat inflammatory disorders of the liver[4]. Chewing the fresh leaves is said to be a cure for mouth ulcers[244]. Daisies also have a reputation for effectiveness in treating breast cancers[7]. The flowers and leaves are normally used fresh in decoctions, ointments and poultices[238]. A strong decoction of the roots has been recommended for the treatment of scorbutic complaints and eczema, though it needs to be taken for some time before its effect becomes obvious[244]. A mild decoction may ease complaints of the respiratory tract, rheumatic pains and painful or heavy menstruation[244]. The plant, harvested when in flower, is used as a homeopathic remedy[232]. Its use is especially indicated in the treatment of bruising etc[232].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden. Succeeds in most well-drained soils in sun or semi-shade[188, 200]. The daisy is commonly found growing in many lawns, some varieties have been developed for the flower garden[1]. It is a good plant for the spring meadow[24]. The plants have a very long flowering season, they will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters[K]. Special Features:Edible, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for dried flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow as soon as the seed is ripe in June. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late summer[200]. Division after flowering[200]. Very easy, it can be done at almost any time of the year, though spring and early summer are best[K]. The divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",
