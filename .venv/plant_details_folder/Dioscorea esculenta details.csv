Sweet and pleasant, with a flavour somewhat like sweet potato or chestnuts[ 301 ]. The tubers are oval, up to 20cm long and 6 - 8cm in diameter. Each plant can produce 5 - 20 tubers. The flesh is yellow or white and the average tuber weight may be 250 - 1,000g, though larger ones can weight 3,000g[ 300 , 418 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 28 - 32°c, but can tolerate 17 - 45°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 9°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 800 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 600 - 8,000mm[ 418 ]. Plants like a well-defined dry season of 2 - 5 months[ 418 ]. This species will grow in drier climates than other yams, so long as the rainfall is evenly distributed through the year[ 300 ]. Succeeds in full sun and also in light shade[ 418 ]. For best yields, this species requires a deep, well-drained, sandy loam that is not liable to water-logging[ 300 ]. This species will succeed in poor gravelly soils, especially if enriched with organic matter[ 300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[ 418 ]. Daylengths of more than 12 hours are preferred during the early growing season since this encourages vegetative growth; daylengths of less than 12 hours towards the end of the growing season will encourage tuber formation and development[ 300 ]. Crops take 7 - 10 months to mature, yields of 7 - 20 tonnes per hectare have been achieved[ 300 ]. There are some named varieties[ 300 , 301 ]. Two main forms of this plant are sometimes recognised:- Var fasciculata (Roxb.)Prain. & Burk. Arose in cultivation and has no spines. Var spinosa (Roxb.)Prain. & Burk. Is believed by many botanists to be the wild form. It has thorny roots protecting the crown of the rootstock[ 266 , 300 ]. This is a variable characteristic, however[ 300 ]. The plant rarely produces flowers[ 418 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female plants need to be grown if seed is required.","Seed - not normally used to propagate this species. Cuttings of tubers. Pieces of tuber, each weighing around 50 - 80g with dormant buds, are planted in situ 4 - 8cm deep with the stem pointing downwards[ 300 ]. The cut tuber is often first left in the sun for several hours to promote wound healing and reduce the risk of fungal infection[ 300 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
