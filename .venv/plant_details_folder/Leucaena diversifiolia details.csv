Benth.,"Leucaena diversifiolia is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The plant is self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Acacia diversifolia Schltdl.,,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant has proved to be effective in controlling soil erosion[303 ]. It is also planted in reforestation schemes for soil amelioration and stabilization[303 ]. Its light crown, and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, makes it an ideal species for shade over perennial crops such as coffee[303 ] The annual leaf dry matter production can reach 10 - 16 tonnes/hectare. When incorporated as green manure, this adds 72 - 119 kg nitrogen, 2.5 - 3 kg phosphorus, 29 - 60 kg potassium, 47 - 94 kg calcium and 7.5 - 18.5 kg magnesium to the soil per hectare[303 ]. Other Uses A water-soluble gum is obtained from the plant[303 ] It contains the sugar rhamnose[303 ]. Sufficiently large logs are used in construction and as poles[303 ]. The pulp is desirable for paper production[303 ]. One of the primary uses of the species is firewood and charcoal; its energy value is 900-19 300 kJ/kg[303 ].","Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Alley crop  Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropSucceeds in moist tropical and essentially frost-free subtropical areas at elevations up to 1,740 metres[303 ]. It grows in areas where the mean annual temperature ranges from 18 - 30°c, and the mean annual rainfall is 600 - 3,500 mm, with 0 - 4 months dry period[303 ]. The natural distribution of L. Diversifolia corresponds to a narrow zone of moist or very moist submontane evergreen forest, subject to frequent mist and cloud cover[303 ]. It also grows sometimes abundantly in secondary vegetation. As a mid-elevation species, it is tolerant of cool climates but not frost[303 ]. Grows best in a sunny position but tolerates some shade[418 ]. Prefers slightly acid, fertile soils but is tolerant of leached soils[303 ]. The aggressive nature and profuse growth occasionally make it a weed[303 ]. The plant is self-fertile; it flowers and fruits over an extended season and sets prodigious quantities of seed from an early age. In other words, it has all the traits to make it an aggressive colonizer of ruderal sites and secondary or disturbed vegetation in many places[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].","Seed - requires pre-treatment to allow water to penetrate the hard coat. This can be done by carefully abrading part of the seed coat, being careful not to damage the seed. Alternatively, soak the seeds in a small quantity of almost boiling water, which cools down quickly enough so that it does not cook the seed. Then soak the seed for 12 - 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing. Treated seeds can give 70% germination within one week[303 ]. Typically, seedlings should be transplanted into the field 8 - 12 weeks after germination[303 ]. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox; viability can be maintained for several years in hermetic storage at room temperature with 5 - 8% mc[303 ]. Vegetative propagation from cuttings and grafts has generally failed, although tissue culture is successful[303 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
