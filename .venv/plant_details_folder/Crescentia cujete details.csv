21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antidiarrhoeal  Astringent  Cholagogue  Diuretic  Dysentery  Emetic  Emmenagogue  Emollient  Expectorant  Laxative  Odontalgic  Purgative  VermifugeThe pulp (of the fruit?[ K ]) is astringent, emollient, expectorant and laxative[ 46 ]. It is used in domestic medicines[ 46 ]. The fruit is abortifacient, emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and vermifuge[ 348 ]. A syrup made from the pulp of the fruit is a popular remedy for colds[ 331 ]. The juice of the fruit is used to treat diarrhoea, pneumonia and intestinal irregularity. It is made into a strong tea and drunk to procure an abortion, to ease childbirth, and is used in a mix to relieve severe menstrual pains by eliminating blood clots[ 348 ]. A syrup made from the fruit is used to treat consumption[ 348 ]. The leaves are cholagogue, emetic (in larger doses), and purgative[ 348 ]. An infusion is sometimes administered for treating dysentery[ 331 ]. It is boiled with sugar, soft grease or Buckley's white rub to make a syrup that is used to treat colds[ 348 ]. Juice of young leaves is drunk to remedy colds and lung diseases[ 348 ]. The leaf is chewed to treat toothache[ 348 ] The leaves are used as a wash to cleanse dirty wounds[ 348 ]. The whole plant is used as a diuretic against hydropsy and diarrhoea[ 348 ]. The ripe fruit-pulp contains crescentic, tartaric, citric, tannic, chlorogenic and hydrocyanic acids, and may cause abortion in cattle[ 348 ]. The seed oil contains oleic acid[ 348 ]. The stem-bark and leaf show antimicrobial activity[ 348 ]",
22,Other Uses,"Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Specimen, Curiosity, Support for epiphytes, Botanic collection, Latge conservatory, Xerophytic. Other Uses The plant produces subglobose hard-shelled fruits about 15 - 30cm long[ 302 ]. Local people constrict the growth of these fruits by tying strings around them and, by so doing, fashion them into a variety of shapes. These can then be used as rattles, bowls, cups, containers etc, in much the same way as bottle gourds are used[ 302 , 331 ]. The most general use of the shells is for making drinking vessels, but the larger ones serve to store all sorts of articles[ 331 ]. Sections of the oblong forms are much used in place of spoons[ 331 ]. Many of the jicaras, as the cups made from the shells are called, are handsomely decorated in colours or by incised designs[ 331 ]. The hard, smooth shells polish well and are finely carved for ritual use in some parts of Africa[ 307 ]. The wood is light brown or yellowish brown, with fine veining of darker colour, without distinctive taste or odour; moderately hard and heavy, tough and strong, coarse-textured, fairly easy to work, takes a smooth finish; but is probably not durable[ 331 ]. It is used for ox yokes, tool handles, and vehicle parts[ 331 ] and is sometimes used in construction[ 302 ]. Thick crooked limbs often are used in Guatemala for making saddle trees[ 331 ]. The wood has been used from Colonial times to the present to make stirrups - some of those of the colonial period are beautifully carved and are real objects of art[ 331 ]. The wood is easy to carve when still green but when thoroughly seasoned is 'like iron' and some have perhaps been in use for 'hundreds' of years[ 331 ]. The wood is also used for fuel[ 307 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  New Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilA plant of the lowland tropics. Prefers a fertile, moist soil in a sunny position[ 302 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[ 307 ]. Plants do not flower until they are quite large[ 200 ], then they can flower all year round[ 307 ]. The flowers emit a pungent, musky, cabbage scent in the evenings[ 307 ]. The large fruits have nectaries that are believed to attract stinging ants. These ants then ward off herbivores such as goats[ 307 ]. The trees seem to afford a particularly good habitat for epiphytes, and in the wild they often are covered with orchids, bromeliads, and other plants[ 307 , 331 ]. Blocks of the wood, used for mounting epiphytic plants, are sold commercially[ 307 ].",
