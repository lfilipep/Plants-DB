Prefers a moist peaty soil in sun or partial shade[187]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. This species is extremely polymorphic, and several varieties and forms have been described in Japan. The many variations in several characters (hairiness, leaf-shape, inflorescence-shape etc.) can be seen in individuals growing intermixed[275]. This species succeeds in a meadow if the grass is not cut until after the plant flowers[200]. Intolerant of root disturbance[1]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, they have been known to destroy even mature plants[K].",Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. Surface sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot in the spring in order to avoid transplanting[133]. We have found that if transplanted when very small seedlings grow away without difficulty[K]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 10°c[133]. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst young. Basal cuttings in spring[K]. Division in spring - very difficult because the plant dislikes root disturbance[1]..,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
