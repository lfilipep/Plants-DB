It is usually found in western tropical Africa. The plant has an extensive, deep root system making it ideal for soil erosion control. The bark and roots are used medicinally to treat a wide range of ailments. The wood can be used as poles and for constructions and fuel. It is resistant to termites, hard, and durable.",

18,Medicinal Uses,"Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PurgativeThe bark and roots are used medicinally as a purgative and against a variety of ailments[ 303 ].,
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The shrubs have an extensive, deep root system that holds the soil and so can be used in schemes to prevent soil erosion[ 303 , 310 ]. The tree produces large amounts of litter and recycles appreciable quantities of nutrients through its deep root system, whilst its dense canopy aids in weed suppression[ 303 ]. It has shown promise as mulch and soil regenerator because of its slow decomposition rate[ 299 , 303 ]. The stems provide good quality poles for staking yams and for construction[ 303 ]. The tree is planted in hedgerows in a traditional alley cropping system with inter-hedgerow spacing of 2 - 3 metres and with 1 - 2 years of cropping followed by 3 - 4 years of fallow. Following the fallow period, the shrubs are underbrushed and burned and stems cut to a height of 10 - 20cm. Some stems are left uncut for live staking of Guinea yam (Dioscorea cayenensis). Crops are then interplanted in the alleys[ 299 ]. Other Uses: The dark red wood is hard, durable and resistant to termite attack[ 299 , 303 ]. The stems provide good quality poles for staking crops and are also used for construction work[ 303 ]. The wood is used for fuel[ 299 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist, lowland tropics, being found at elevations below 300 metres[ 303 ]. It grows in areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 20 - 34°c, and the mean annual rainfall is 750 - 1,500 mm[ 303 ]. Well adapted to leached, acid and infertile (ultisols) soils, the plant can also survive occasional flooding[ 303 ]. Established trees coppice well, even after pollarding or burning, and are fire resistant[ 99 , 303 ]. Planted at 4 metres x 4metres, this species can produce 6 tonnes per hectare dry prunings, 4 tonnes of twigs and 9 tonnes of wood within 8 months[ 303 ]. It has been suggested that Dactyladenia lehmbachii and Dactyladenia pallescens, which flower in the same period, may cross-pollinate with this species[ 299 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - germinates readily[ 303 ]. Direct sowing is possible but seedlings survive better when raised in nursery bags before planting out[ 303 ]. Seed germinates readily and can be stored for up to 6 months at 15°c when treated with copper sulphate[ 303 ]. Occasionally, stakes are used as cuttings in live fence systems[ 303 ]. Juvenile stem cuttings will also root quickly at the peak of the rainy season[ 299 ].",
