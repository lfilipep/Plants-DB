22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Screen, Specimen, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a moist acid peaty soil but it requires a sheltered position because the young growth is easily damaged by frost[11, 182, 184, 200]. Plants grow best with a western exposure so that they are protected from morning frosts[11]. They flower more freely when grown in a sunny position[200]. Best grown in shade or semi-shade[188], they grow well in a woodland garden[200]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[182, 200]. The flowers are delicately scented[245]. A slow growing plant[200]. Plants sometimes succumb to an incurable fungal infection[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in the spring on a fine moss peat. Keep the compost moist and place the pot in a shaded part of the greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady part of the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of short side branches with a heel, August/September in a frame[1]. Layering. Offsets."
