The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

A flavour somewhat like a water melon according to some people, but this is possibly the product of a strained imagination[K].The fruit contains about 3.4% sugar, 1.5% protein, 1.6% ash[194]. Vitamin C is 6.3mg per 100ml of juice[194]. The fruit is about 10mm in diameter with the appearance and texture of a strawberry but very little flavour[K]. A clump 2.5m² yields about 150g of fruit annually[194].

It can be used in decoction or the fresh leaves can be crushed and applied externally as a poultice[147]. It is used in the treatment of boils and abscesses, weeping eczema, ringworm, stomatitis, laryngitis, acute tonsillitis, snake and insect bites and traumatic injuries[147]. A decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of swellings[147, 178, 218]. An infusion of the flowers is used to activate the blood circulation[218].

It is rather bare in winter though[K] and should not be grown with small plants since it will drown them out[208]. A good cover for bulbous plants[214]. Perennial groundcover for zone 2 firebreaks. The US government has created a system of firebreaks for areas prone to wildfires, theses are separated into concentric zones surrounding buildings. Zone 2 is the second away from the house. These low-level groundcovers provide little fuel.",,"Prefers a moist but well-drained soil in a sunny position[175]. Plants are at their best in semi-shade, though they are not too fussy[214] and can succeed in quite dense shade[208, 214]. They also grow well in a rock garden[1]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1] but it can be invasive, spreading freely by means of runners[187]. Plants are more or less evergreen, though they can be browned by severe frosts[214]. Plants sometimes self-sow in British gardens[214]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1]. Heat Zone: 8-6.","Seed - sow spring in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 weeks or more at 15°c. A period of cold stratification may speed up germination. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division of runners in spring or late summer. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
