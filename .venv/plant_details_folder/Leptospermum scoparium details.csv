17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"resh, pungent leaves are a fragrant and refreshing tea substitute[144, 153, 183]. Of excellent quality, in taste trials this species has often received higher marks than the traditional China tea obtained from Camellia sinensis[K]. It is important to brew the leaves for considerably longer than normal teas to ensure the flavour is released into the water[K]. A sweet manna is sometimes exuded from the stems as a result of insect damage[153, 173]. Another report says that manna is reported to form on the leaves[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Roofing: Used to give a waterproof roof to buildings. See also Thatching.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"This species can be grown as a hedge in the milder areas of Britain[200] and is reasonably tolerant of maritime exposure. Plants should not be trimmed back into old wood, however, because they do not regenerate from such treatment. A yellow-green dye is obtained from the flowers, branches and leaves[168]. A greenish-black dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. Source of an insecticide[153] (no further details).  - red, strong, elastic. Used for inlay work, cabinet making etc[61]. The bark is used for roofing huts[61]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Screen, Seashore. Succeed in almost any neutral or acid soil of good or reasonable quality[200], preferring a light sandy loam and full sun[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Prefers a position sheltered from hot or cold drying winds. We have found the plants to be fairly tolerant of maritime exposure[K]. The plant only succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of Britain. Hardy to about -10°c, succeeding outdoors in most of Southern Britain[184]. A polymorphic species, many forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. There are some dwarf varieties that grow very well in pots in cold greenhouses and conservatories[260]. Resents root disturbance. Plants do not regenerate from old wood[200]. The bruised leaves and the flowers are pleasantly aromatic[219, 245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. The seed remains viable for many years. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, early August in a frame. Over-winter in the greenhouse for its first year. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 4 - 5 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. Good percentage[78]."
