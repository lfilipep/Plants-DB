13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pinus lambertiana is an evergreen Tree growing to 75 m (246ft 1in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"enerSeed - raw or cooked[1, 2, 62, 63, 92, 257]. A good size, up to 15mm x 10mm[200]. A pleasant sweet nutty flavour[11, 183], with a hint of resin[2]. The nut, together with the shell, can be pulverised into a nut butter[84]. A sugar is obtained from boiling off the water in the sap[1, 2, 63, 92, 94]. Some caution is advised since it is laxative if used in large quantities[95]. A sweet sugar-like substance exudes from wounds made in the heartwood of the tree[81, 82, 183] and also from the cones. It is sometimes used for sweetening foods, though in large quantities it is laxative[2, 183]. The pitch obtained from the trunk is allowed to harden and is then used as a chewing gum[257]. A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Carminative  Laxative  Ophthalmic  PoulticeThe turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. The sap is carminative and laxative[257]. The dried sap powder has been eaten in the treatment of stomach gas, constipation, ulcers etc[46, 61, 84, 92, 94]. It has also been used to make eye drops to treat sore eyes[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Adhesive: Glues.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Pitch: Used for waterproofing, in paints etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. Yields a pitch, though it is not commercially important[64]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4].  can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc. The resin is used as an adhesive[257].  - light, soft, straight but coarse grained. Used for lumber, interior finishes etc[46, 82, 84, 171, 229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. Plants have a deep taproot that anchors them firmly when growing in a windy site[229]. A very vigorous tree in Britain, capable of growing 1 metre per year when young[185]. The trees are long-lived in their native environment, but can take 100 years or more before they come into reliable seed bearing[229]. Even then seed production is sparse, with good yields only every 4 - 5 years[229]. The cones open and shed their seed in early autumn whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226]. They are up to 45cm long and often drip with a sweet sap[81]. Unfortunately the cones are seldom borne in Britain[11], though a tree at Hawkestone Park in Shropshire often bears cones[11]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow beneath the tree[18]. Trees are susceptible to the 'white pine blister rust' and should not be grown near to blackcurrants[120, 200]. This rust killed off all the plantings of this species that were made prior to 1960[185]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The crushed leaves and shoots have a sweet grapefruit-like aroma[185]."
26,Plant Propagation,"It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81]."
