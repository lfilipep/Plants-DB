21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Blood purifier  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Poultice  Tonic  VDThe stems are blood purifier, diuretic, febrifuge and tonic[22, 46, 61, 257]. They are beneficial in the treatment of urogenital complaints[22, 46, 61]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of kidney problems, gonorrhoea and the first stages of syphilis[257]. A poultice of the powdered stems has been applied to sores[257]. The stems of most members of this genus contain the alkaloid ephedrine and are valuable in the treatment of asthma and many other complaints of the respiratory system[K]. The whole plant can be used at much lower concentrations than the isolated constituents - unlike using the isolated ephedrine, using the whole plant rarely gives rise to side-effects[254]. Ephedra does not cure asthma but in many cases it is very effective in treating the symptoms and thus making life somewhat easier for the sufferer. The stems can be used fresh or dried and are usually made into a tea, though they can also be eaten raw[K]. The young stems are best if eating them raw, though older stems can be used if a tea is made[K]. The stems can be harvested at any time of the year and are dried for later use[238]."
