13,Summary,"Prosopis alba can reportedly tolerate drought, salt and sand; in fact, it is extremely efficient with regards to water consumption, it produces the most fruits in years of drought and has been successfully introduced in arid terrains."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prosopis alba is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"enerPod - fresh or dried[418 ]. The pod can be eaten as a fresh fruit or conserved in its own sweet fresh juice[418 ]. If the pod is dried then ground into a powder, it gives a flour that can be mixed with a little water and eaten immediately or used for making cakes[317 , 418 ]. The popular drink 'aloja' is prepared with the fresh, sweet tasting pods[317 ]. A gum obtained from the stems has a soft consistency and a sweet flavour. It is used as a candy[303 ]. Staple crop: balanced Carb."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antiseptic  Dysentery  EmollientLeaf extracts have shown antibacterial activity[418 ]. The bark, branches, gum and foliage are antiseptic, antidysenteric and emollient[418 ]. They are used as a treatment against gastritis[418 ]"
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The nitrogen fixing properties, rapid growth and deep roots make this a suitable species for erosion control and soil improvement[418 ]. The tree is planted in reclamation schemes for salt-affected soils[317 ]. Windbreak. Other Uses: A gum obtained from the trunk has physical and chemical properties similar to gum arabic (Acacia spp.)[418 ]. The bark is rich in tannins[317 ]. The wood contains 5 - 9% tannins[303 ]. The heartwood is reddish-brown; the sapwood yellowish[303 ]. The wood is fairly dense and difficult to work[303 , 414 ]. It is used for parquet floors, doors and furniture[325 , 414 ]. The wood is excellent for both firewood and charcoal[325 , 414 , 418 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Fodder: Pod  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA plant mainly of the dry subtropical zone, extending into the tropics at higher elevations in Bolivia and Peru. (though it is found at elevations as low as 360 metres at latitude 18°S in Bolivia). It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures fall within the range 10 - 20°c, though it can tolerate 7 - 28°c and an absolute maximum of 45°c[418 ]. Mature specimens can tolerate occasional short-lived temperatures down as low as -6°c, though younger plants can be killed at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 200 - 500mm, tolerating 100 - 700mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position[418 ]. Succeeds in most soils so long as they are well-drained[418 ]. Tolerates somewhat saline soils[325 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7[418 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[418 ]. Under optimal conditions a large tree (40 cm in basal diameter and 7 m in canopy diameter) may produce 40 kg of pods[325 ]. There are some forms of this plant that are thorn-free[414 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it remains viable for several years in normal storage[325 ]. The seeds are hardcoated and must be scarified in order to germinate. Burning, nicking and immersion in boiling water are some of the methods that can be used. If the seeds are not extracted from the pods before sowing, they will normally require several minutes of boiling to overcome dormancy. Normally the seeds are sown directly in containers. Germination starts after 2 weeks and continues for up to one month. When the plants are 30 - 35cm tall they are ready for planting in the field[325 ]. Direct seeding is also possible[325 ]. Seed need to be inoculated with mesquite rhizobia. Competes well with grasses and shrubs."
