25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant[203], preferring a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1, 90]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -10°c[214]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[203]. The flowers are softly scented[245]. Some forms of this species, especially A. moly bulbiferum[203], produce bulbils in the flowering head[42] and can be invasive[203]. The species type is sometimes considered to be invasive, though it has not proved so with most people[203]. It is useful for naturalising between shrubs and grows well at the base of a beech hedge in a wet garden[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. It is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for dried flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. Very easy, the plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season and the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required. Plants sometimes produces bulbils, these can be potted up as soon as they are ripe and planted out in late spring.",
