It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils.

19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw, cooked or dried for later use[3, 101, 105, 118, 183, 257]. Somewhat sweet but slightly dry[183, 256]. The fruit is quite palatable but is nothing special[K]. A strong flavour, they are usually cooked in pies, preserves etc[177, 183]. The fruit will often hang on the bush until early winter[256]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200]. A tea is made from the leaves and dried fruit[101].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist but freely-draining lime free soil, preferring one that is rich in peat or a light loamy soil with added leaf-mould[11, 200]. Prefers a very acid soil with a pH in the range of 4.5 to 6, plants soon become chlorotic when lime is present. Succeeds in full sun or light shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[200]. Most species require shelter from strong winds[200], but judging by the native range of this species it might succeed in maritime exposure[K]. Hardy to about -15°c[184]. Plants are sometimes cut back by late frosts[11] A very ornamental plant[60], it is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. One report says that it does not fruit freely in Britain[11], but a shrub growing in the shade of oak trees at the RHS gardens in Wisley was seen to be heavy with fruit in the autumns of 1987 and 1988[K]. A shade loving plant, growing well in a woodland[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dislikes root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots until being planted out in their permanent positions[200].  Special Features:North American native, Edible, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse in a lime-free potting mix and only just cover the seed[78]. Stored seed might require a period of up to 3 months cold stratification[113]. Another report says that it is best to sow the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe[200]. Once they are about 5cm tall, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame[78]. Slow and difficult. Layering in late summer or early autumn[78]. Another report says that spring is the best time to layer[200]. Takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in spring or early autumn[113].",
