24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soil[200], thriving in a well-drained loamy soil[1], but resenting dryness at the roots[11, 200]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[200], but if it is grown in a low rainfall area then it requires shade at the hottest part of the day[11]. Does well on very acid soils with a pH around 4.5[200]. The colour of the flowers reflects the pH of the soil the plant is growing in, the flowers are pink in a neutral to alkaline soil and blue in an acid soil. Best grown in an acid soil, doing well on very acid soils (pH 4.5). There is some confusion over the correct name for this plant. We have used the name in [174] but the Flora of Japan[58] says that the correct name is H. macrophylla angustata. Plants are hardy to about -25°c when dormant[200], but the young growth in spring can be killed by late frosts[K]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse in spring[113]. Cover the pot with paper until the seed germinates[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 8cm long, July/August in a frame. Overwinter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in late autumn in a frame[200]. Mound layering in spring. Takes 12 months[78]. Leaf-bud cuttings of the current seasons growth in a frame[200].",
