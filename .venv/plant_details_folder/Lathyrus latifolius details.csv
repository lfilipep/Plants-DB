21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown without supports when they will sprawl on the ground and can be used as a ground cover plant in a sunny position[188, 202]. They should be spaced about 1.5 metres apart each way[208]. They are very vigorous and so are best not used with small plants[K]. They also die down completely in the winter, giving weeds a chance to become established[K].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Arbor, Container. An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good garden soil[200], whether acid or alkaline[202]. Prefers a position in full sun but tolerates part day shade[200]. Succeeds in dry soils and is drought tolerant when established[190]. Grows well on dry slopes[208]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants are hardy to at least -10°c[202]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[187]. It is fast-growing and, when in a suitable position, can become invasive[202]. Plants climb by means of tendrils[188]. Resents root disturbance and can take a year or two to settle down after being moved[219]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Suitable for cut flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Herbaceous. A suckering vine sending up suckers some distance main plant [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200]. Division in spring. It may not transplant well so care should be taken[200].",
