22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The thin-walled culm is used locally in basketry and other handicrafts[310 , 361 ]. The culm is used for making water pipes, arrow heads and as a casual drinking vessel[310 ]. Strips of the culms are used as binding material in roofings, fish traps and screens[310 , 361 ]. The dead canes of this species are useful when lighting camp fires, even in wet weather[713 ]. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: biomass. Other Systems: strip intercrop, multistrata.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: Multistrata  Other Systems: Strip intercropClimate: subtropical to tropical, tropical highlands. Humidity: humid. Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[K]. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. This species, however, is reported to flower regularly in cultivation without dying, though these specimens do not set seed[361]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: managed multistem.",
