Requires a position sheltered from cold drying winds[1, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[184], they can be cut to the ground in severe winters but usually resprout from the base, especially if they have been well mulched, they will then flower in late summer[11, 182, 200]. Plants succeed in an open position at Wisley in Surrey[11]. Spreads rapidly by suckers[11]. Flowers are produced on the current seasons growth[200]. They have a delicious scent[245].

When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings, 6 - 8cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Very easy, they can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
