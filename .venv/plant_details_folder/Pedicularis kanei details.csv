This species is possibly no more than a part of P. lanata, though P. kanei might be the correct name for both species[204]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. A semi-parasitic plant, growing on grass roots. Rather difficult to establish in cultivation, it is best grown in conditions that approximate to its native habitat[200]. It requires a moist peaty soil and the presence of host grasses[1]. Requires a partially shaded to sunny site in a well-drained gritty but moist soil[200].",Seed - sow in pots of turf collected from the proximity of wild colonies or sow directly onto the sites where the plants are to remain[200]. Division of established plants might be possible in the spring.
