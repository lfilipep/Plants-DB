Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.","Fraxinus excelsior is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from May to October, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to January. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Bog Garden;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","re seed - usually pickled by steeping in salt and vinegar, and then used as a condiment for other foods[2, 8, 66, 183]. The leaves are sometimes used as an adulterant for tea[2, 177, 183]. A manna is obtained from the tree[183]. No further details are given. An edible oil similar to sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oil is obtained from the seed[7].","Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Astringent  Carminative  Cathartic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Laxative  Purgative  TonicThe leaves are astringent, cathartic, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, laxative and purgative[4, 7, 9, 13, 21, 165, 254]. The have been used as a laxative, making a mild substitute for senna pods[254]. The leaves should be gathered in June, well dried and stored in airtight containers[4]. The bark is antiperiodic, astringent and a bitter tonic[4, 240]. Little used in modern herbalism, it is occasionally taken in the treatment of fevers[254]. The seeds, including their wings, have been used as a carminative[4]. They will store for 12 months if gathered when ripe[4].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string.

The bark is a source of tannin[4]. A tying material can be obtained from the wood[6] (does this mean the bark?). Very tolerant of extreme exposure and relatively fast growing, though often windshaped in exposed positions, it can be grown as a shelterbelt tree[49, 200]. However, it is late coming into leaf and also one of the first trees to lose its leaves in the autumn and this makes it less suitable in a shelter belt.  - hard, light, flexible, strong, resilient. A very valuable wood, it is much used for tool handles, oars, furniture, posts etc[4, 6, 7, 13, 46, 66]. An excellent fuel, burning well even when green[6]. There is some doubt over how well the green wood burns with several people claiming that it needs to be properly seasoned[K].",,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pollard, Specimen. Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. Plants can succeed in very exposed positions, including maritime exposure, though they can become wind-shaped[49]. Thrives in alkaline soils[11] but not in shallow soils over chalk. Tolerates a pH as low as 4.5, but prefers a base-rich soil above 5.5[186]. Trees are surprisingly tolerant of seasonally water-logged soils[186]. Dislikes dryness at the roots, especially in late spring[186]. Very intolerant of shade, young plants fail to develop properly in such a position and often die. Although the dormant plant is very cold-hardy, the young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A fast growing tree, it is sometimes cultivated for its valuable timber. Very tolerant of cutting, ash was also at one time frequently coppiced for its wood[186]. However, modern use of plastics have reduced its economic values. There are many named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[11]. Trees have a light canopy and cast little shade[186]. A food plant for many insect species, there are 41 associated insect species[24, 30]. Trees can be male, female, monoecious or hermaphrodite, they can also change sex from year to year[11]. Trees take 30 - 40 years to flower from seed[186]. The flowers are produced on one-year old wood[7]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Approximately 5% of stored seed will germinate in the first year, the remainder germinating in the second year[186]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds. Cuttings of mature wood, placed in a sheltered outdoor bed in the winter, sometimes strike.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
