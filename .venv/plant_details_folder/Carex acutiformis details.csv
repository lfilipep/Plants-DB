There is some doubt about the validity of this name. The original report on the plants uses is for a species called C. acutifolia. Ehrh. which is said to be native to Europe but is not in 'Flora Europaea'. We feel that this name is probably a misprint for C. acutiformis[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in a damp to wet soil in full sun or shade[162, 200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - sow in situ in the spring in a moist soil in light shade. If seed is in short supply it can be sown in a cold frame and be planted out in the summer. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 15°c[138]. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
