25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun[220]. This species tolerates a wide range of soils, including those that are dry, stony and nutrient deficient[200]. One report says that this species will probably not survive long outdoors in Britain, even though it is the hardiest member of the genus[1]. Another says that it is quite hardy in Britain[11] whilst a third says that it can tolerate temperatures down to about -7°c[200]. A specimen planted at Kew in 1987 was 2½ metres tall and looking very healthy in August 1999[K]. Trees are relatively slow-growing in the wild[229].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires some cold stratification. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in a cold frame in mid-winter. Move to a greenhouse in early spring. The seed should germinate in late spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fairly good percentage[78].",
