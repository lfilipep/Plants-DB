22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a freely draining gritty soil, preferably of fairly low fertility, and a position in full sun[200]. Dislikes winter wet. Plants are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, though they should succeed in the milder areas of the country, especially if given the additional protection of a wall. They are hardy to about -10°c, so long as they are not too wet[257]. Excess moisture, especially in the winter, is the main cause of death.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse in a gritty well-drained compost, and only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, being careful not to over-water. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in the spring.",
