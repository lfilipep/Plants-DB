17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw, cooked or dried for later use[257]. Sweet and gelatinous[85]. Lean and insipid[95]. The unripe fruits can be added to soups etc, imparting an okra-like mucilaginous quality[183]. The fruit can hang on the plant all year round[160]. Be careful of the plants irritant hairs, see notes above. The fruits of O. macrorhiza are about 4cm in diameter and usually free of spines[200]. The following notes are for O. compressa. They almost certainly also apply to this species[K]. Pads - cooked or raw[62, 160]. Watery and very mucilaginous[85]. Seed - briefly roasted then ground into a powder[62]. It is also used as a thickener[62]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The following notes are for O. ficus indica. They almost certainly also apply to this species[K]. A gum is obtained from the stem. It is used as a masticatory or mixed with oil to make candles[64]. The juice of the boiled stem segments is very sticky. It is added to plaster, whitewash etc to make it adhere better to walls[92]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sandy or very well-drained soil[160]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 to 7.5[200]. Plants must be kept fairly dry in the winter but they like a reasonable supply of water in the growing season[200]. A position at the base of a south-facing wall or somewhere that can be protected from winter rain is best for this plant. Requires warmth and plenty of sun. Plants tolerate considerable neglect. A fairly cold tolerant plant, it can succeed outdoors in a selected site in the milder areas of the country[200]. This species is closely related to O. compressa[235]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a very well-drained compost in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from winter wet. Make sure you have some reserve plants in case those outdoors do not overwinter. Cuttings of leaf pads at any time in the growing season. Remove a pad from the plant and then leave it in a dry sunny place for a couple of days to ensure that the base is thoroughly dry and has begun to callous. Pot up into a sandy compost. Very easy, rooting quickly."
