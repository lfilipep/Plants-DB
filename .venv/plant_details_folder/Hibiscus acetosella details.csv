18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked. An acid flavour with a mucilaginous texture, they can be added to salads or used in soups, stews etc[183, 299, 308]. They can be cooked with other foods to give them an acid sorrel-like flavour[183]. Yellow-flowered types with green leaves are most popular for this purpose, but red-flowered types with dark red leaves are also eaten[299]. Types with decorative pinkish-brown leaves are used in fresh salads, being appreciated for their special rather sour taste[299]. The red flowers and possibly also the leaves are occasionally used to make a tea, somewhat similar to the use of the red calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa[299]. Root - it is edible but is very fibrous[144]. Mucilaginous, without very much flavour[144, 299].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.An infusion of the leaves in water is used as a post-fever tonic and as a treatment for anaemia[299].The leaves are crushed and soaked in cold water and the infusion is used for washing babies and young children who have body pains[299, 398].",
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Grown as a hedge in food gardens, where it can be used as a food as well as a barrier[299]. The form 'Red Shield' makes an ideal hedge[301].The plant is highly resistant to root-knot nematodes and is, therefore, an excellent crop to be used after tomatoes or other solanaceous vegetables that are affected by nematodes[299].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Hibiscus acetosella is found over a large area of tropical Africa, usually being grown at low to moderate elevations. It can also be grown as an annual in warm temperate areas. It grows best in areas with good rainfall[299].Succeeds in a sunny position, but prefers some shade[299]. Prefers a well-drained humus-rich fertile soil[200]. There are some named varieties[200]. Plants are resistant to root-knot nematodes[298].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Germination is usually quite rapid. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Give them some protection until they are growing away well. A sowing outdoors in situ during April might work, though if the summer is cool the plants might not flower and set seed. Cuttings - easy.",
