An acid flavour with a mucilaginous texture, they can be added to salads or used in soups, stews etc[183, 299, 308]. They can be cooked with other foods to give them an acid sorrel-like flavour[183]. Yellow-flowered types with green leaves are most popular for this purpose, but red-flowered types with dark red leaves are also eaten[299]. Types with decorative pinkish-brown leaves are used in fresh salads, being appreciated for their special rather sour taste[299]. The red flowers and possibly also the leaves are occasionally used to make a tea, somewhat similar to the use of the red calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa[299].

It can also be grown as an annual in warm temperate areas. It grows best in areas with good rainfall[299].Succeeds in a sunny position, but prefers some shade[299]. Prefers a well-drained humus-rich fertile soil[200]. There are some named varieties[200]. Plants are resistant to root-knot nematodes[298].","Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Germination is usually quite rapid. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Give them some protection until they are growing away well. A sowing outdoors in situ during April might work, though if the summer is cool the plants might not flower and set seed.
