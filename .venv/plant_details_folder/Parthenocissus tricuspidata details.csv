Plants should be spaced about 2.5 metres apart each way[208]. They are very vigorous, however, and would soon swamp smaller plants[K].",,"Landscape Uses:Arbor, Woodland garden. Requires a well-drained moisture retentive fertile soil[200]. Succeeds in any fertile soil in sun or part shade[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -15°c[200], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. A very ornamental plant[1], there are several named varieties[182]. The flowers are only produced on mature stems[202] and plants usually only fruit after a long hot summer[219]. A rampant climbing plant, clinging by means of round pad-like suckers on the tendrils[11]. It can become a bit of a nuisance by growing into gutters[182]. Plants are very tolerant of trimming and can be cut right back to within 1 metre of the base if required to rejuvenate the plant[202]. Any pruning is best carried out in the spring[219]. Dislikes transplanting[11], plants often put on very little growth in the year after planting out, though they are then fast growing[202]. Plants often hybridize and so do not always come true from seed[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires stratifying for 6 weeks at 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Germination is variable. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm taken at a node (ensure that it has at least 2 true buds), July/August in a frame[78]. Easy to root but they do not always survive the first winter[182].
