See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from September to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.,,Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - cooked. Steeped and boiled[177]. It can also be dried for later use[257]. The root is said to be extremely nutritious[85], though some native North American Indian tribes believed that eating it could cause insanity[257]. It is easiest to use when the plant is in flower because the outer layer of the root (which is very bitter) slips off easily at this time of the year[85]. The root has a good taste though a decided bitter flavour develops afterwards[105, 161].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a very well-drained gritty humus-rich deep soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil[188]. This species is not reliably hardy in Britain. It can withstand consistently very cold weather but does not like alternating periods of mild and cold conditions, nor does it like winter wet[1]. The plant is very susceptible to rotting at the neck in a damp soil[200]. Plants die down after flowering and start growing again in the autumn[188]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Polymorphic[60]. Very apt to hybridize with other members of this genus[1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in a very freely draining soil[129]. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in a cold frame. One months cold stratification should improve germination, though this is still likely to be very slow. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in March/April.
