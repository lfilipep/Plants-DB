Sweet and delicious, it makes an excellent dessert fruit and is also used in savoury dishes as a vegetable[K]. The fruit is rather small and fiddly, about 10 - 15mm in diameter, but it is produced in quite large bunches and is well worth the effort of picking[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[46, 61]. The seed is small and it would be very fiddly to utilize. It is only viable to use the seed as a source of oil if large quantities of the plants are being grown for their fruits and the seed is not wanted.","Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Germination is usually quick and good. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich compost as soon as the first true leaf appears and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Seed can also be sown in situ under a cloche at the end of April, though in a cool summer the results may be disappointing. The seedcoat may carry tomato mosaic virus. However, by sowing the seed 15mm deep the seedcoat will remain below the soil surface when the seed germinates and the disease will be inactivated[124].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
