See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to May, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",P. maculosa.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover; Hedgerow;,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 7, 8, 9, 105]. They can be added to salads or used as a potherb[183]. A fairly bland flavour but the leaves are low in fibre and make an acceptable addition to mixed salads, though their mucilaginous and slightly hairy texture make them less acceptable when eaten on their own[K]. The young leaves make a palatable cooked vegetable[244], though we have found the texture to be somewhat slimy[K]. The plant is an ingredient of the drink Vermouth[244].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Resolvent: Breaks down tumors.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Demulcent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emollient  Expectorant  Homeopathy  Ophthalmic  ResolventLungwort has a high mucilage content and this makes it useful in the treatment of chest conditions, being of particular benefit in cases of chronic bronchitis[254]. It combines well with other herbs such as coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) in the treatment of chronic coughs including whooping cough and can also be taken to treat asthma[254]. The leaves and flowering shoots are astringent, demulcent, diaphoretic, diuretic, emollient, mildly expectorant and resolvent[4, 7, 9, 21, 165]. They are often used for their healing effect in pulmonary complaints[4] and their mucilaginous nature makes them beneficial in treating sore throats[244]. The leaves can also be used externally to stop bleeding[254]. They are harvested in the spring and dried for later use[7]. A distilled water made from the plant is an effective eyewash for tired eyes[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of bronchitis, coughs and diarrhoea[9].",,"A tolerant and slow growing ground cover plant for open woodland and border edges[197, 200]. Plants should be spaced about 50cm apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Grows well in any moderately good soil including heavy clay soils[1, 31]. Prefers full to part shade in a moist humus rich soil[200]. Succeeds in the sunless shade of buildings[200]. Plants growing in shady positions tolerate drought if the soil is rich in humus[190]. The leaves tend to wilt in hot weather when the plant is grown in full sun[190]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer and rabbits[233]. A valuable early nectar source for bees[200]. There are several named forms, selected for their ornamental value[233]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn or after flowering in early summer if the soil is not too dry[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
