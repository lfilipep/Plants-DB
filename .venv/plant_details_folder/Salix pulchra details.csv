See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",S. planifolia pulchra.

It can be dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups or can be added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots and leaves - raw or cooked[257]. They are not very palatable[172]. The leaves and shoots can be eaten with oil to make them more palatable[257]. A good source of vitamin C, they are one of the first new leaves to be produced in the spring[257]. The leaves can be added to soups or eaten in mixed salads[257]. Catkins[177].

They have also been chewed as a treatment for mouth sores and are said to make the mouth smell good[257]. The cottony seed floss has been used to dry moist eyes[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213].

Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Considered to be part of S. phylicifolia by some botanists[60]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious.
