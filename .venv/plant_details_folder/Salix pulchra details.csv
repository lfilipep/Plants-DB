The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

19,Edible Uses Description,"- raw or cooked[172, 177]. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups or can be added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots and leaves - raw or cooked[257]. They are not very palatable[172]. The leaves and shoots can be eaten with oil to make them more palatable[257]. A good source of vitamin C, they are one of the first new leaves to be produced in the spring[257]. The leaves can be added to soups or eaten in mixed salads[257]. Catkins[177]. No more details are given. The dried leaves have been used to make a tea[257]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anaesthetic: Numbs the feeling in a local or general area of the body.,Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Mouthwash: Treats problems such as mouth ulcers.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anaesthetic  Anodyne  Febrifuge  Mouthwash  Vitamin CAn infusion of the leaves and bark has been used as an anaesthetic[257].The bark and the leaves have been chewed to numb the mouth and throat[257]. They have also been chewed as a treatment for mouth sores and are said to make the mouth smell good[257]. The cottony seed floss has been used to dry moist eyes[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Considered to be part of S. phylicifolia by some botanists[60]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy."
