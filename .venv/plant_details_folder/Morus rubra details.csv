13,Summary,"Form: Rounded, Spreading or horizontal."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Morus rubra is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw, cooked or made into preserves[2, 3, 21, 62, 149, 183]. Large and sweet with a good flavour, the fruit can be up to 3cm long[200]. The fruit can also be dried and ground into a powder[183]. This is used to make a delicious confection with almonds and other nuts[183]. The fruit is soft and juicy, when fully ripe it falls from the tree and is easily squashed[227]. Unripe fruits can cause stomach disorders[226]. Young shoots and unfolding leaves - raw or cooked. The related White Mulberry (Morus alba) has edible young leaves and shoots eaten cooked[105, 183] but we have found no information for this plant."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Cathartic  Dysentery  FebrifugeThe root bark is anthelmintic and cathartic[21]. A tea made from the roots has been used in the treatment of weakness, difficult urination, dysentery, tapeworms and as a panacea[222, 257]. The sap is used in the treatment of ringworm[222, 257]. Another report says that the milky juice obtained from the axis of the leaf is used[21]. The fruits are used to reduce fevers[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A cloth can be made from the fibrous bark[149].  - coarse-grained, light, very durable, not strong, soft, rather tough. It weighs about 45lb per cubic foot and is used for boats, fencing and cooperage[46, 61, 82, 227, 229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Pollard. Prefers a warm well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 11]. The red mulberry is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. It is said to be of no value as a fruiting tree in Britain[1, 11]. Trees come into bearing when about 10 years old, fruiting best between the ages of 30 - 85 years and declining from the age of 125 years[227]. A good plant to grow grapes into. The grapes are difficult to pick but they always seem to be healthier and free from fungal diseases[201]. Mulberries have brittle roots and so need to be handled with care when planting them out[238]. Any pruning should only be carried out in the winter when the plant is fully dormant because mulberries bleed badly when cut[238]. Ideally prune only badly placed branches and dead wood[238]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious[229] Male and female plants must be grown if fruit is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, There are no flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed germinates best if given 2 - 3 months cold stratification[80, 98]. Sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if possible, otherwise in February in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in the first spring, though it sometimes takes another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. A good percentage take, though they sometimes fail to thrive[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 25 - 30cm with a heel of 2 year old wood, autumn or early spring in a cold frame or a shady bed outside[78, 113,200]. Bury the cuttings to threequarters of their depth. Layering in autumn[200]."
