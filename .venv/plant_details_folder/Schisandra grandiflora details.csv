See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Kadsura grandiflora.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; East Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105, 177]. A pleasantly acid flavour[2], they make a nice dessert fruit[K]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter and is borne in a grape-like bunch about 12cm long[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Prefers a rich well-drained moisture retentive soil[11, 200]. Prefers a slightly acid soil but tolerates some alkalinity if plenty of organic matter is added to the soil[200]. Requires some protection from the most intense sunlight[200]. Prefers light shade but tolerates full sun if the soil is reliably moist and the roots are in shade[202]. Plants are intolerant of drought[K]. The fully dormant plant is hardy to about -15°c[184], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants are of slow to moderate growth rate[202]. The shoots are semi-twining, but plants often require some support by tying the plant in[202]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Another report says that the plants are monoecious (male and female flowers are separate but are found on the same plant)[182].","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200, 238]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a greenhouse in the spring[238]. Germination can be slow and erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for their first 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Overwinter in the greenhouse and plant out in late spring[11, 78]. Good percentage[78]. Layering of long shoots in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
