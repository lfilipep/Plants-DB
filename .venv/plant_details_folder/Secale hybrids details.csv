13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Secale hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

19,Edible Uses Description,"bon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. A minor or regional perennial crop in production with low or unreported yields  [1-1]. Perennial hybrids are now under development. Wild perennial species found in Turkey , for example, Secale monatum Guss var. anatolicum Boiss and Secale montanum Guss var. vavilovi Grossh.  have a larger stature, high frost resistance, strong tillering ability, and tolerance to poor soils and drought. Understanding wild plant species is becoming important in the development of new hybrid crops."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Possible. For example Secale cereale seed is made into a poultice and applied to tumours[218].

23,Other Uses Description,Many including Biomass;  Green manure;  ;  Soil stabilization;  and Thatching.
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Under DevelopmentClimate: boreal to warm temperate, Mediterranean. Humidity: semi-arid to humid.
