13,Summary,"A genus of 25–35 species of deciduous flowering plants in the family Salicaceae, also known as the common names Aspen, Poplar, Cottonwoods. A large genetic diversity, and can grow from 15–50m (49–164 ft) tall. Poplars are rapid-growing but relatively short-lived trees. widely distributed throughout the northern temperate regions, ranging from North America through Eurasia and northern Africa. Like willows (Salix spp.), their close relatives, poplars are known for fast growth and rapid biomass accumulation. Most coppice well and are easy to propagate from cuttings."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Populus hybrids is a TREE growing to 50 m (164ft) by 30 m (98ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid, very alkaline and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"rich in protein and have a greater amino-acid content than wheat, corn, rice and barley[226]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: protein (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiscorbutic: A plant rich in vitamin C that is used to counteract scurvy.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Antiscorbutic  Antiseptic  Antitussive  Cathartic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Ophthalmic  Skin  Stimulant  TonicSome. See individual species. For example Balsam poplar has a long history of medicinal use. It was valued by several native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a variety of complaints, but especially to treat skin problems and lung ailments[257]. In modern herbalism it is valued as an expectorant and antiseptic tonic. The leaf buds are antiscorbutic, antiseptic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant, tonic[4, 46, 61, 165, 172]. The leaf buds are covered with a resinous sap that has a strong turpentine odour and a bitter taste[213].They are boiled in order to separate the resin and the resin is then dissolved in alcohol[222]. The resin is a folk remedy, used as a salve and wash for sores, rheumatism, wounds etc[222, 257]. It is made into a tea and used as a wash for sprains, inflammation, muscle pains etc[222]. Internally, the tea is used in the treatment of lung ailments and coughs[222]. The buds can also be put in hot water and used as an inhalant to relieve congested nasal passages[213]. The bark is cathartic and tonic[4]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the bark of most, if not all members of the genus contain salicin, a glycoside that probably decomposes into salicylic acid (aspirin) in the body[213, 238]. The bark is therefore anodyne, anti-inflammatory and febrifuge. It is used especially in treating rheumatism and fevers, and also to relieve the pain of menstrual cramps[238]. A tea made from the inner bark is used as an eye wash and in the treatment of scurvy[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Like willows (Salix spp.), their close relatives, poplars are known for fast growth and rapid biomass accumulation. Most coppice well and are easy to propagate from cuttings [1-1]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Agroforestry Services: windbreak, living trellis (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland). : bank. Other Systems: SRC, irreg. intercrop, strip intercrop. Commonly grown as windbreaks. Intercropped with annuals across northern China. In Italy they are pruned to be living trellises for grape growth."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world. The annual value of each is more than $1 billion US Examples include coconuts, almonds, and bananas.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Irreg. Intercrop: Irregular intercropping systems are trees scattered throughout cropland.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
