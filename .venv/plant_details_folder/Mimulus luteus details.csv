24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers rather moist places such as damp borders, margins of streams and boggy spots[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Thrives in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out[200]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. There is some confusion over the naming of this plant, the entry on edibility may refer to M. guttatus, which is closely related to this species[161, 200]. Hybridizes with M. guttatus[187].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only lightly cover the seed[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it can also be sown in situ in late spring after the last expected frosts[200]. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of softwood, 5cm long in spring or summer[200].",
