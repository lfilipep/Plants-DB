24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a rich moist soil, preferring to grow in dappled shade[200, 238]. Closely related to C. japonica, a species that is cultivated as a vegetable in Japan[43, K]. This species is being cultivated in America to supply the Japanese market with a chervil-like herb[218]. Slugs are extremely fond of this plant, especially when the new growth emerges in spring[K]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April in a greenhouse. Germination is usually rapid, prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. The ideal temperature for sowing is about 25°c, though seed does germinate at higher and lower temperatures[206]. Seed can also be sown in early autumn[206]. Division in spring or autumn."
