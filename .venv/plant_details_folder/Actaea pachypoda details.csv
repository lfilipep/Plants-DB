24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame or in a sheltered outdoor bed[200]. Completely remove the seed pulp since this can inhibit germination. Stored seed does not usually germinate well[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year.
