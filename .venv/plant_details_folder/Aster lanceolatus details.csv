Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  VulneraryAn infusion of the plant, combined with another unnamed plant, has been used in the treatment of fevers[257]. A decoction of the plant has been used to dress wounds[257]. The dried and powdered plant has been used as a salve on abrasions[257]. Smoke from the crushed blossoms has been inhaled in the treatment of nosebleeds[257].",,Attracts wildlife,,"Succeeds in most good garden soils[1], preferring one that is well-drained and moisture retentive[200]. Prefers a sunny position[200], but it also succeeds in partial shade[233]. Prefers a rich soil[1], but tolerates poor ones[233]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[257]. Plants need to be divided every few years, preferably in the spring, in order to keep the plant vigorous[187]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The flowers attract butterflies and moths, it is also a good bee plant providing nectar in autumn[30].","Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
