22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. We have no details of its cultivation needs, though it is likely to succeed in a lightly shaded site, possibly in a woodland."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter in a cold greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring might also be possible[K]."
