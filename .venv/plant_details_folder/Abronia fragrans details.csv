The flowers are produced in terminal clusters, they only open in the coolness of the evening, diffusing a vanilla-like perfume[245]. Seed is rarely ripened on plants growing in Britain[1].","Seed - sow autumn or early spring very shallowly in pots of sandy soil in a greenhouse[133]. Germination can be very slow unless you peel off the outer skin and pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water[200, 245]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 15°c[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Seedlings are prone to damp off and so should be kept well-ventilated[200]. Plant out in late spring, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in spring, rooted in sand[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
