A gum from the plant has been used as a glue[257]. Plants have an extensive spreading root system that helps to bind the soil together. They are planted on slopes and other fragile soils for the prevention of soil erosion[181]. Large roots burn well and have been used for firewood[257]. Branches have been tied together then burnt for use as a torch[257].,,"Requires a sheltered sunny position in a well-drained soil[182, 200] and protection from cold winds[200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain and do not withstand exposure to prolonged winter frosts though they succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[182, 200]. In colder areas they are best grown against a south or south-west facing wall[200]. The leaves are resinous and catch fire easily[181]. They have a pleasant aroma[200].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow the plants on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse or cold frame, planting them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings could be tried in August of half-ripe wood, preferably with a heel, in a frame.
