18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves and flower buds - raw or cooked[105]. Eaten in times of want[177]. When added to soup they thicken it in much the same way as okra[85, 159]. The flowers of this species are usually purplish[266] - some caution is advised if plants of this genus have yellow flowers since these can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62]. A tea can be made from the leaves[85]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a cool moist well-drained humus-rich soil in partial or dappled shade and protection from scorching winds. Tolerates sandstone and limestone soils but becomes chlorotic if the pH is too high. Prefers a pH between 6 and 6.5[200]. All members of this genus have more or less edible leaves and flower buds, though those species with yellow flowers can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62, 85, 159]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in the autumn or just after flowering. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring."
