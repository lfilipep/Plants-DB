The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.

18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"et manna-like substance that forms on the twigs is used to adulterate cane sugar[177, 183]. It can also be eaten with porridge etc or mixed with water to make a refreshing drink[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  BitterThe galls are astringent[240]. The bark is astringent and bitter[240].,

23,Other Uses Description,"Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it makes a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens[229]. Galls produced on the twigs and flowers (probably as a result of insect activity[K]) contain up to 55% tannin[223]. The wood has been used for fuel[257].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant of saline conditions[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils as well as in sands and even shingle[182]. Usually found near the coast, it succeeds inland if given a fairly good deep loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerant of maritime winds and dry soils when grown near the coast[11], plants require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in non-saline soils because they use the soil salts that are found in saline soils to help them reduce transpiration[200]. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain[1], but it succeed in the milder areas of the country, tolerating temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. This species flowers on the current year's growth[200]. Any pruning is best carried out in spring, hedges are also best trimmed at this time[188]. Plants are tolerant of severe pruning, sprouting freely from old wood[K]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15 - 25cm long, planted outdoors in late autumn in a nursery bed or straight into their permanent position. High percentage[11, 200].",
