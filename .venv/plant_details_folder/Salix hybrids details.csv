13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix hybrids is a deciduous Shrub growing to 25 m (82ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",

17,Edible Parts,Leaves: ,
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,
19,Edible Uses Description,dual species. In some species the inner bark and leaves are edible.,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Some. See individual species. Willow bark was the basis for aspirin development. Many cultures have used willow bark for pain relief, thanks to a compound in willow bark called salicin.",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Filter: Used to strain out particles from liquids.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Wastewater treatment - converting wastewater to biomass fuel by taking up excess nutrients in warer for fertilizer. A strong, light flexible wood used for basketry, fencing and natural building. Erosion control and bank stabilization akong streams and rivers [1-1]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. : bank. The leaves are a good fodder for livestock. Other Systems: SRC. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: SRCClimate: , tropical highlands. Humidity: semi-arid to humid, aquatic. There are tree, shrub, and ground cover willows. Usually coppiced or pollarded when managing. Some coppiced willows have lived to 800 years. Easy to breed and hybridize. Willows are very cross-compatible, and numerous hybrids occur, both naturally and in cultivation. A well-known ornamental example is the weeping willow (Salix × sepulcralis), which is a hybrid of Peking willow (Salix babylonica) from China and white willow (Salix alba) from Europe. Breeding work has increased biomass yields 50% in the last few decades. European breeding emphasises Salix viminalis and four or five others while North America is based on Salix purpurea and others. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
