Judging by its native habitat it probably requires a very well drained light soil in a sunny position. It is said to be calcicole[50] and so requires an alkaline soil.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a greenhouse and only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
