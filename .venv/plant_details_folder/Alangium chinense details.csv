Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Blood tonic  Carminative  ContraceptiveThis plant is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218]. The roots and the stems are a blood tonic, carminative and contraceptive[147]. They are used in the treatment of rheumatism, numbness, traumatic injuries, wounds and snakebites[147]. A decoction of the leafy shoots is said to be tonic[218]. A paste of the roots is applied to the area around dislocated bones to help them setting[272].

Requires full sun and a sheltered position[200]. Not very frost tolerant[200], this species is likely to be on the borderlines of hardiness even if obtained from its higher provenances[11]. However, although the top growth will be killed back in all but the mildest winters, the plant will usually resprout from the base in the spring and will usually flower in the summer[245]. These flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This species is closely related to A. platinifolium[200]. Although a fair sized tree in its native habitat, it is unlikely to make more than a shrub more than 2 metres tall in Britain[245]. It does not require pruning[245].","Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors.
