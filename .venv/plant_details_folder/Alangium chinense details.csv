24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Requires full sun and a sheltered position[200]. Not very frost tolerant[200], this species is likely to be on the borderlines of hardiness even if obtained from its higher provenances[11]. However, although the top growth will be killed back in all but the mildest winters, the plant will usually resprout from the base in the spring and will usually flower in the summer[245]. These flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This species is closely related to A. platinifolium[200]. Although a fair sized tree in its native habitat, it is unlikely to make more than a shrub more than 2 metres tall in Britain[245]. It does not require pruning[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200]."
