26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise sow it in late winter. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a shady part of the greenhouse or cold frame. Plant out in early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 4 - 7cm long taken at a node, June - August in a shady position in a frame[78]. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer[K]."
