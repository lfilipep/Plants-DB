See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Amaracus hybridus.,Cultivated Beds;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",The aromatic foliage is used as a condiment[177].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Prefers slightly alkaline conditions[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. This species is not very hardy outdoors in the colder areas of Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A hybrid species, O. dictamnus x O. sipyleum[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - sow in a greenhouse in early spring at 10 - 13°c and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. This is a hybrid species and will not breed true from seed. Division in March or October. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings of young barren shoots in June. Very easy. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
