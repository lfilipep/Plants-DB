18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw. Sweet but thin fleshed[227]. The thin flesh has a sweet, mealy pleasant taste[K]. The fruit is small, up to 10mm in diameter, with a single large seed[82, K]. The trees often produce large crops of fruit in Britain, but there is so little that is edible on each fruit that it is scarcely worthwhile[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Wood - very tough, pliable, durable. Of no commercial value[229]. The flexible thin shoots are used as walking sticks, the wood is also an excellent fuel.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any reasonably good soil, preferring a good fertile well-drained loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds on dry gravels and on sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Trees prefer hotter summers and more sunlight than are normally experienced in Britain, they often do not fully ripen their wood when growing in this country and they are then very subject to die-back in winter[1, 11, 200]. This species is very closely related to C. occidentalis, and it is considered to be no more than a sub-species by many authorities[200]. Trees can be very long-lived, perhaps surviving for 1000 years in the wild[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed is best given 2 - 3 months cold stratification and then sown February/March in a greenhouse[78, 200]. Germination rates are usually good, though the stored seed might take 12 months or more to germinate. The seed can be stored for up to 5 years[113]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The leaves of seedlings often have a lot of white patches without chlorophyll, this is normal and older plants produce normal green leaves. Grow the seedlings on in a cold frame for their first winter, and plant them out in the following late spring or early summer[K]. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings",
