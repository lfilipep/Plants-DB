Judging by the plants native habitat, it is likely to be tolerant of maritime exposure[K]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A rather greedy plant, it is apt to impoverish the soil[1].

Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
