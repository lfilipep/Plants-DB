24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a neutral to slightly acid loamy soil, but tolerates a chalky sub-soil if the top soil is deep[200]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[188]. The dormant plant is hardy to about -15°c, though the tree is somewhat hardier if the wood is thoroughly ripened by a long hot summer[200]. The young shoots in spring can be damaged by late frosts. A very ornamental plant[1]. The flowers have a most delicious perfume, which can be wafted far and wide by warm breezes[245]. Trees produce fruit regularly at Kew[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed is required. Female plants can produce some fruit in the absence of a male plant[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[78]. Germination is usually very good[78]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their fist two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring, after the last expected frosts and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Plants cannot be sexed until they flower[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair percentage[78]. Layering in spring. Takes 12 months[78]."
