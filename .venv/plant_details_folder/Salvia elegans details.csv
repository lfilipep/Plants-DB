24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very well-drained light sandy soil in a warm sunny position[200]. Prefers a rich soil[1]. Plants can be killed by excessive winter wet[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. The top growth will be cut back to the ground in cold winters but, if the roots are given a good mulch in the autumn, plants will often survive the winter outdoors and resprout freely from the base in the spring[200]. There are some named varieties. 'Scarlet Pineapple' has leaves with a pineapple-like scent[238]. The flowers are very attractive to bees, providing a good source of nectar[61]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200]."
