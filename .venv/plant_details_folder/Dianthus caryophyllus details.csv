26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in slight heat in a greenhouse[1]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks at 15°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in July[1]. Cuttings of non-flowering basal shoots, June/July in a frame[200]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
