24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most fertile well-drained soils[233], though it prefers a moist but very well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil[1, 200]. Plants are impatient of drought and of too much sunshine, growing best in a shady position[221, 271]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants are best grown in a greenhouse in Britain, they are seldom fully happy outdoors and do not usually open their flowers properly[221]. Plants usually set seed freely and will often self-sow in the garden[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A short-lived perennial[200], in the garden it is best grown from seed as a biennial or propagated each year from the non-flowering side rosettes[221]. The woody roots will usually persist for some years so long as the plant is in a well-drained soil and a sunny position[233]. Except in the most sheltered of positions, the tall flowering stems require staking in order to stop them snapping at the base in high winds[271]. This species is closely related to C. versicolor. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The cultivar 'Alba' is used as an altar flower in its native regions, this cultivar demands an especially well-drained soil and is less hardy than the type[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. It is best to sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse in order to give the plant a long season of growth, otherwise sow it in late winter[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. The plant has a thick fleshy root with a number of crowns. Whilst this can be divided if great care is taken not to damage the root, it is not really recommended because the divisions take a long time to become established[221]."
