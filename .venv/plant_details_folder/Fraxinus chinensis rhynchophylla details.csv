See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",F. bungeana. non DC. F. rhyncophylla.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Antitussive  Astringent  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  StomachicThe bark is analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, astringent, diuretic, expectorant and stomachic[176, 218, 238]. It controls bacterial infections and coughs[238]. It is used in the treatment of apoplexy, liver diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, eye diseases such as cataracts, cough and asthma[176, 279]. The bark contains aesculin, this has anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant and analgesic actions[176]. The bark also contains fraxetin. This has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system, is a stronger and safer anodyne than aspirin and has some antibacterial activity[176].","Weather protection: Plants that can be used to give the body protection from severe weather.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",The plant (extract?) is said to be used as a barrier to protect the skin from ultra-violet light[176]. The wood is used for cabinet making[266].,,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. Plants succeed when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. They tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. This sub-species grows well in Britain and is much more common in cultivation than F. chinensis[11, 200]. This species might be dioecious, in which case male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
