If seed is in short supply we would recommend sowing it in a cold frame.

Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Fair percentage[78]. Root cuttings, 3cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78].
