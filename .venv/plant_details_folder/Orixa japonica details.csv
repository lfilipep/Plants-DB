24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile soil in sun or part shade[182, 200]. Survives in fairly dry shady conditions[200]. The leaves have a foetid smell[184]. They are distinctly and pleasantly aromatic according to another report[182] whilst another says that they release an orange-like pungency when pressed[245]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[182]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - one report suggests sowing the seed outdoors in the spring[200]. If seed is in short supply we would recommend sowing it in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Fair percentage[78]. Root cuttings, 3cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78]. Removal of self-layered branches at any time in the dormant season[200]."
