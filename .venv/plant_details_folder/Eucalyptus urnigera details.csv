0,Eucalyptus urnigera,Urn tree,Myrtaceae,7-9,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269].","The dominant eucalypt species at altitudes from 600 to 1,000 metres (1,969 to 3,281 ft) on moist but well drained dolerite slopes and talus. Typically, it is found below the range of E. coccifera (snow gum) and above the mixed and wet sclerophyll forests of the lower slopes although it will grow within both vegetation types.",An endemic Tasmanian alpine eucalypt of the sub genus Symphomyrtus.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Eucalyptus_urnigera1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Eucalyptus_urnigera2.JPEG",,"Eucalyptus urnigera is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The flowers are pollinated by Birds.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",E. urnigera var. elongata Rodway,,None known,,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Eucalyptus leaves are a traditional Aboriginal herbal remedy. The essential oil found in the leaves is a powerful antiseptic and is used all over the world for relieving coughs and colds, sore throats and other infections[254]. The essential oil is a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold remedies[254]. The plant is an aromatic, astringent, tonic herb that sticks to the teeth and turns the saliva red[238]. The report says that the leaves, essential oil and oleo-resin are used[238], but does not specify which properties apply to the different parts of the plant[K]. The leaves and the oil will have very similar properties, the oil being much stronger in its effect since it is distilled from the leaves[K]. Detailed below is how the oleo-resin and oil are commonly used in other species[K]. The essential oil obtained from various species of eucalyptus is a very powerful antiseptic, especially when it is old, because ozone is formed in it on exposure to air. It has a decided disinfectant action, destroying the lower forms of life[4]. The oil can be used externally, applied to cuts, skin infections etc, it can also be inhaled for treating blocked nasal passages, it can be gargled for sore throat and can also be taken internally for a wide range of complaints[4]. Some caution is advised, however, because like all essential oils, it can have a deleterious effect on the body in larger doses[4]. An oleo- resin is exuded from the tree[238]. It can also be obtained from the tree by making incisions in the trunk[4, 152]. This resin contains tannin and is powerfully astringent, it is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and bladder inflammation[4, 152, 238], externally it is applied to cuts etc[4, 152]. Treats throat ailments[156].",,"An essential oil is obtained from the leaves. Total quantity of the oil, and its composition, can vary widely from plant to plant, but we have reports that the fresh leaves contain around 1.8 - 3.9% (2.5 - 5.6% dry weight) essential oil. The main components include phellandrene, cymene, pperitone, methyl cinnamate and eudesmol[1659 ]. The heartwood is pale brown, straw-coloured or pinkish; the 30mm thick band of sapwood is almost white. The wood is open-textured, straight-grained, with conspicuous growth rings. It bends fairly well, is easily worked and polishes well. An excellent timber, it is widely in construction, for purposes such as building framing, flooring, plywood and veneers, furniture, panelling, turnery, handles and pulp for hardboard and paper[1097 , 1658 ]. A handsome dense foliaged screening tree and good garden specimen that is a superior ornamental tree to E. gunnii due to the attractive foliage and bark. Eucalyptus urnigera does not have any commercial use as a timber tree in Tasmania.",,"A small to medium-sized fast growing tree endemic to Tasmania where it only occurs at mid to high altitudes. Prefers sun to light shade and well-drained soil, light moisture. Most reports say it is hardy to USDA Zone 8 although we have found references that it grows in zone 9. Flowering period: Late summer This species has been confused with E. gunnii to which it is closely allied but from which it is well distinguished by the stalked, urn-shaped fruits on a long common-stalk. Flowers are white in small clusters.  Fruit is urn shaped (urceolate) 15 x 9 mm. Can be coppiced. Very hardy tolerating down to -14C to -16C. Tolerates difficult growing conditions including intermittently waterlogged soils and exposed locations. Generation length 70 years.","Seed - surface sow late winter/early spring in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11 , 78 , 134 ]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2c[200 ]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in early summer, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
