Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anaesthetic  Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Cardiotonic  VasodilatorA widely used herbal remedy in China, where it is cultivated for its root[218]. This is harvested in the autumn as the plant dies down and is then dried before being used. The root is anaesthetic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antirheumatic, cardiotonic, stimulant and vasodilator[176, 218, 238]. It is used in the treatment of shock and collapse, chronic diseases with symptoms of cold, gastralgia and rheumatic arthralgia, oedema and diarrhoea due to hypofunction of the spleen and kidney[176]. A tincture of the root is used externally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthralgis, sprains, contusions etc[283]. Use with great caution, the plant contains the toxic alkaloid aconitine and is very poisonous - should not be used internally[218] unless under the direction of a qualified practitioner[238, 283]. Overdoses lead to numbness of the tongue, lips and extremities, nausea, vomiting, irritability and coma[176].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in most soils and in the light shade of trees[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a moist soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Plants will only thrive in a sunny position if the soil remains moist throughout the growing season[238]. Prefers a calcareous soil. This species is not included in the Flora of North America[270] and so it should be considered doubtful that its range includes this region. A very ornamental plant[233], there are some named forms[238]. It grows well in open woodlands[1, 4]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits and deer[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby species, especially legumes[54]. Closely related to A. fischeri and considered to be part of that species by some botanists[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[111]. The seed can be stratified and sown in spring but will then be slow to germinate[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division - best done in spring but it can also be done in autumn[1, 111]. Another report says that division is best carried out in the autumn or late winter because the plants come into growth very early in the year[233].",
