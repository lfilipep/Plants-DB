Pioneer Species– helps reestablish overused or damaged land. Nitrogen Fixing Plant – this plant creates its own nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with microorganisms (bacteria) in its roots. Dynamic Accumulator Species – Potassium, Phosphorus, Nitrogen."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in a sunny position if the soil is reliably moist throughout the growing season, otherwise it is best grown in semi-shade[200]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible seed which is used as a lentil substitute[2]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen."
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in spring or autumn.
