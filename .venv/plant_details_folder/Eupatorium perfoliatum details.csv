It has been shown to stimulate resistance to viral and bacterial infections, and reduces fevers by encouraging sweating[254]. The plant, however, should be used with some caution since large doses are laxative and emetic and the plant might contain potentially liver-harming pyrrolizidine alkaloids[222]. The leaves and flowering stems are antispasmodic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, emetic, febrifuge, laxative, purgative, stimulant, vasodilator[4, 61, 165, 238]. A hot infusion of the dried leaves and flowers is used as a very effective treatment to bring relief to symptoms of the common cold and other similar feverishness - it loosens phlegm and promotes its removal through coughing[213, 254, 268]. This herb is practically unequalled in its effectiveness against colds[268]. It is also used in the treatment of rheumatic illness, skin conditions and worms[254]. The leaves and flowering stems are harvested in the summer before the buds open, and are dried for later use[238]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh plant, harvested when it first comes into flower[232]. It is used in the treatment of illnesses such as flu and fever[232].
