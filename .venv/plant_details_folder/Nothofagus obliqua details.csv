The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

21,Other Uses Description,"A fast growing tree, it can be used as a hedge or windbreak[188]. Another report suggests that it is not a good wind resister[11].  - heavy, hard, durable, very good quality. Used for furniture, ship-building, interior joinery. A very good fuel[11, 46].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers an open well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds on most soils, including sandy ones[188], but dislikes calcareous soils[11]. Prefers a pH between 5 and 7, but dislikes acid peats[200]. Plants can be damaged in severe winters when young but they become hardier with age. They succeed at Crarae in western Scotland[191]. Prefers a cool wet summer in a temperate maritime climate[200] but it also does well in a Mediterranean climate with as little as 400mm of rain a year[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it often self-sows in Britain[11]. Responds well to coppicing[11]. Trees have poor wind resistance in Britain, probably because they grow so fast[11]. Trees up to 4 metres tall can be successfully established, though the optimum size for transplanting is about 30 - 80cm. The roots are very sensitive to desiccation and extreme care should be taken when moving plants[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cool greenhouse or cold frame. Spring-sown seed requires 2 - 3 months stratification at 1 - 5°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed must not be allowed to dry out according to one report[80] whilst another says that the seed can be stored dry at 2°c for long periods[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Layering.",
