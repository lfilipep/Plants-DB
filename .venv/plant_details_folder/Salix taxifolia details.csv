17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"- raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - cooked. Not very palatable[172].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiperiodic  Febrifuge  MalariaThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226]. The bark is used as a remedy for malaria[149, 227].",
22,Other Uses,Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,
23,Other Uses Description,"Succeeds in wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11]. The branches are used to make brooms[149]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
