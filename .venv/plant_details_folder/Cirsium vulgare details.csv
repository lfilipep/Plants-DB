Main:Bloom Time: Early summer, Late summer, Mid summer.","Cirsium vulgare is a BIENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies), beetles. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. lanceolatum. non Hill. Carduus lanceolatus.,Meadow; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Oil: Oil,Curdling agent: used to curdle soya milk in making cheese.,Oil: ","oot - cooked[183]. A taste somewhat like a Jerusalem artichoke, but not as nice[K]. A rather bland flavour, the root is best used mixed with other vegetables[9]. The root can be dried and stored for later use[257]. The root is rich in inulin, a starch that cannot be digested by humans. This starch thus passes straight through the digestive system and, in some people, ferments to produce flatulence[K]. Young flower stems - cooked and used as a vegetable[177, 183]. Young leaves can be soaked overnight in salt water and then cooked and eaten[183]. Another report says that they can be used in salads[9]. The taste is rather bland but the prickles need to be removed from the leaves before the leaves can be eaten - not only is this a rather fiddly operation but very little edible matter remains[K]. Flower buds - cooked. Used like globe artichokes[177, 183], but smaller and even more fiddly. The dried flowers are a rennet substitute for curdling plant milks[183]. Seed - occasionally eaten roasted[183].","Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antihaemorrhoidal  Antirheumatic  PoulticeThe roots have been used as a poultice and a decoction of the plant used as a poultice on sore jaws[257]. A hot infusion of the whole plant has been used as a herbal steam for treating rheumatic joints[257]. A decoction of the whole plant has been used both internally and externally to treat bleeding piles[257].,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.","A fibre obtained from the inner bark is used in making paper. The fibre is about 0.9mm long[189]. The stems are harvested in late summer, the leaves removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped off. The fibres are cooked with lye for two hours and then put in a ball mill for 3 hours. The resulting paper is a light brown tan[189]. The seed of all species of thistles yields a good oil by expression[4]. No details of potential yields etc are given[K]. The down makes an excellent tinder that is easily lit by a spark from a flint[212].",,"The common thistle is a pernicious weed that spreads freely by means of its seed which can be dispersed by the wind over a large area. The seedlings are capable of establishing themselves in grassland. This plant should not be encouraged, and if growing on your land should be cut down before it sets seed. What better way of discouraging it is there than eating it? An easily grown plant, succeeding in any ordinary garden soil in a sunny position[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow early spring or autumn in situ. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 8 weeks at 20°c[164].
