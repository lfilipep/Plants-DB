14,Physical Characteristics,"Colchicum autumnale is a BULB growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from February to July, in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antirheumatic  Cathartic  Emetic  HomeopathyThough known since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, autumn crocus was considered too poisonous to use medicinally and it was not until research in the Eighteenth century that the plant was discovered to be of value in the treatment of gout[268]. In modern herbalism it is still used to relieve the pain and inflammation of acute gout and rheumatism, although frequent use has been known to encourage more frequent attacks of the complaint[232, 268]. Both the corm and the seeds are analgesic, antirheumatic, cathartic and emetic[4, 7, 13, 21, 235]. They are used mainly in the treatment of gouty and rheumatic complaints, usually accompanied with an alkaline diuretic[4]. Leukaemia has been successfully treated with autumn crocus, and the plant has also been used with some success to treat Bechet's syndrome, a chronic disease marked by recurring ulcers and leukaemia[254]. A very toxic plant, it should not be prescribed for pregnant women or patients with kidney disease, and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The seeds are harvested in early summer, the corms in mid to late summer when the plant has fully died down. They are dried for later use[238]. The fresh bulb is used to make a homeopathic remedy[232]. It is used in the treatment of nausea, diarrhoea and rheumatism[232]."
20,Other Uses,Plant breeding: Used in producing new species of plants or improved varieties.
21,Other Uses Description,"The poisonous alkaloid 'colchicine' is extracted from this plant and used to alter the genetic make-up of plants in an attempt to find new, improved varieties[9, 13, 19, 46, 100, 171]. It works by doubling the chromosome number[89]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Border, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen. Prefers a rich well-drained loam in a sunny position[1, 188]. Tolerates partial shade but dislikes dry soils[1]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.5 to 7.5. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[200]. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -5°c[214]. The autumn crocus is easily grown in grass[90] and can be naturalized there[200]. It also grows well amongst shrubs and by woodland edges[28]. Plant the corms about 7 - 10cm deep in July[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233], though slugs may attack the corms[238]. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[201].  Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early summer in a seed bed or a cold frame[1, 164]. Germination can be very slow, taking up to 18 months at 15°c[164]. It is best to sow the seed thinly so that it is not necessary to transplant the seedlings for their first year of growth. Apply a liquid fertilizer during their first summer, however, to ensure they get sufficient nourishment. Prick out the seedlings once they are dormant, putting perhaps 2 plants per pot, and grow them on in a greenhouse or frame for at least a couple of years. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. The seedlings take 4 - 5 years to reach flowering size[1]. Division of the bulbs in June/July when the leaves have died down[1]. Larger bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out. The plant can be divided every other year if a quick increase is required[1]."
