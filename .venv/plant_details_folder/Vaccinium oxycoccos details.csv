13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Vaccinium oxycoccos is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: ,
18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 13, 17, 101, 171, 257]. Considered by some to be the most pleasantly-flavoured of British wild fruits[11]. The fruit is high in pectin[172], this means that it can be mixed with fruits that are low in pectin to help them set when making jam[K]. Pectin has also been shown to have a valuable role in the diet, where it is said to protect the body against radiation[201]. An acid taste, the fruits are usually cooked in preserves etc[183, 200]. Although smaller than the related V. macrocarpon, the fruit of this species is considered to be of superior taste[183]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200]. A tea is made from the leaves[13, 257].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  UrinaryAn infusion of the plant has been used to treat cases of slight nausea[257]. Treatment for urinary infections - cystitis, and scurvy [301].",
22,Other Uses,"Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.",
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the fruit is used to clean silver[6]. A red dye is obtained from the fruit[13]. Plants can be grown as a ground cover when planted about 1 metre apart each way[208]. Plants rapidly form a dense carpet when they are thriving[208].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist or wet lime free soil, preferring one that is rich in peat or a light loamy soil with added leaf-mould[11, 200]. Prefers a very acid soil with a pH in the range of 4.5 to 6, plants soon become chlorotic when lime is present. Succeeds in full sun or light shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[200]. Requires shelter from strong winds[200]. The fruit often persists on the plant all winter without rotting[200]. Dislikes root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots until being planted out in their permanent positions[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse in a lime-free potting mix and only just cover the seed[78]. Stored seed might require a period of up to 3 months cold stratification[113]. Another report says that it is best to sow the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe[200]. Once they are about 5cm tall, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame[78]. Slow and difficult. Layering in late summer or early autumn[78]. Another report says that spring is the best time to layer[200]. Takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in spring or early autumn[113].",
