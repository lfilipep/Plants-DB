Soils rich in nitrogen encourage excessive leaf growth at the expense of flowering[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. It is as hardy as common sage, S. officinalis[182], to which it is closely related[11]. Plants can be killed by excessive winter wet[200]. The leaves have a pungent lavender scent[182]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
