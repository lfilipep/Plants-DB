4,Known Hazards,"No reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, but the following reports have been seen for S. officinale. This plant contains small quantities of a toxic alkaloid which can have a cumulative effect upon the liver. Largest concentrations are found in the roots, leaves contain higher quantities of the alkaloid as they grow older and young leaves contain almost none. Most people would have to consume very large quantities of the plant in order to do any harm, though anyone with liver problems should obviously be more cautious. In general, the health-promoting properties of the plant probably far outweigh any possible disbenefits, especially if only the younger leaves are used."

14,Physical Characteristics,"Symphytum grandiflorum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.6 m (2ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"A very good ground cover plant[188, 208]. It spreads rapidly to form a good carpet, rooting as it spreads, and should be spaced about 60cm apart each way[208]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch. Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Specimen, Woodland Forest Garden. Shelter for insects, nectary, Green mulch. Notable Products: Sheep and chicken food."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soils and situations but prefers a moist soil and some shade[1, 4]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Grows well under trees[208]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200]. Plants can be invasive, often spreading freely by means of self-sown seed[200]. The root system is very deep and difficult to eradicate, even small fragments of root left in the soil can produce new plants.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Fragrant foliage, Invasive, Naturalizing. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.) For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If you have sufficient seed you can try an outdoor sowing in situ in the spring. Division succeeds at almost any time of the year. Simply use a spade to chop off the top 7cm of root just below the soil level. The original root will regrow and you will have a number of root tops, each of which will make a new plant. These can either be potted up or planted out straight into their permanent positions."
