24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Prefers a well-drained but moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200] or in partial shade[187]. A vigorous and invasive plant, only really suitable for larger areas in the wild garden where this habit is not a nuisance[200]. The stems and leaves are covered with a soft down that emits the smell of the Moss Rose and Eglantine. The plants have the refreshing scent of ripe apples[245]. A good late source of nectar for bees[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in situ or as soon as the seed is ripe. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
