24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  New Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilClimate: subtropical. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. A hairy vining plant similar in appearance to its close relative Cucurbita palmata but the lobes of its leaves are usually more slender. It is a prostrate vine, rarely climbing, with a deep root and slender branches. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus Cucurbita. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
