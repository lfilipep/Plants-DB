14,Physical Characteristics,"Calamintha nepeta is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.8 m (2ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Aromatic  Diaphoretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  StomachicLesser calamint was commonly used as a medicinal herb in medieval times, though is little used by modern herbalists[238]. It is sometimes cultivated as a medicinal herb for household use. The whole plant is aromatic, diaphoretic, expectorant, febrifuge and stomachic[4, 148]. The leaves are harvested in July as the plant comes into flower and are dried for later use[4]. An infusion is beneficial in cases of flatulent colic and weaknesses of the stomach[4], it is also used to treat depression, insomnia and painful menstruation[238]. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women since in excess it can cause a miscarriage[238].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained dry to moist neutral to alkaline soil and a warm sunny position[200, 238]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[187]. This species is very closely related to C. sylvatica, and is considered to be no more than a sub-species by some botanists[4]. A very good bee plant[187]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. It usually germinates in 2 weeks at 21°c[138]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and, if they grow sufficiently, plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer otherwise wait until the following spring. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be planted direct into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are well rooted before planting them out in the summer. Basal cuttings in May or June. They should be rooted in a sandy compost[245]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
