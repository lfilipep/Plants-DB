2,Family,Polygonaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been made for this species, there have been reports that some members of this genus can cause photosensitivity in susceptible people. Many species also contain oxalic acid (the distinctive lemony flavour of sorrel) - whilst not toxic this substance can bind up other minerals making them unavailable to the body and leading to mineral deficiency. Having said that, a number of common foods such as sorrel and rhubarb contain oxalic acid and the leaves of most members of this genus are nutritious and beneficial to eat in moderate quantities. Cooking the leaves will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Edible Portion: Leaves, Shoots, Rhizomes, Roots. Young shoots in spring - cooked. They can be used as an asparagus substitute[55, 62, 116, 1599, 179, 183]. They have an acid flavour and can also be used as a rhubarb substitute in pies, fruit soups, jams etc[183]. Older stems and shoot tips - cooked[62, 159]. They taste like a mild version of rhubarb[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It is rather small and fiddly to utilize. The seed can also be ground into a powder and used as a flavouring and thickener in soups etc, or can be mixed with cereals when making bread, cakes etc. The root is sometimes eaten[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Possibly may have similar properties to other knotweeds where the root can be antiphlogistic, bechic, depurative, diuretic, emmenagogue, emollient, febrifuge, stomachic and vulnerary[46, 61, 147, 178, 218]. It is also used in the treatment of women's complaints[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of burn injuries, boils and abscesses, poisonous snakebites, acute hepatitis, appendicitis, traumatic injuries and menstrual irregularities[147]. The leaves can be crushed and applied externally as a poultice to abscesses, cuts etc, whilst the dried roots can be ground into a powder and applied externally[147]. Extracts of the plant have shown antitumour activity[218]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: fiber (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: HayClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidty: humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: experimental. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,Plants can be grown from seeds.
