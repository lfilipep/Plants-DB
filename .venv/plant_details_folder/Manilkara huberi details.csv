22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"The latex is a source of an inferior balata in Guyana[317 ]. Balata is a gum, resembling rubber, used to make gaskets, chewing gum etc[K ]. The heartwood is dark red brown with purplish shade; it is clearly demarcated from the 4 - 6cm wide band of whitish to pale brown sapwood. It is finely and uniformly textured; usually straight-grained. The wood is very hard, very heavy, tough, strong, elastic; very durable, even in contact with the soil, being very resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites, but susceptible to marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for internal purposes only, and needs to be done with care because of the density of the wood. The wood is used for several purposes, both internal and external. It is used for purposes such as sculpture, tool handles, industrial or heavy flooring, sliced veneer, stairs, furniture , ship building, wood frame house, bridges, posts, stakes, sleepers, heavy carpentry[386 , 848 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: ProteinHumid Tropics. Grows best in a sunny position[420 ].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[420 ]. Sow in a well-drained seedbed in semi-shade[420 ]. Germination usually takes place in 4 - 8 weeks, though germination rates are usually low[420 ].",
