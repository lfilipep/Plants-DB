Balata is a gum, resembling rubber, used to make gaskets, chewing gum etc[K ]. The heartwood is dark red brown with purplish shade; it is clearly demarcated from the 4 - 6cm wide band of whitish to pale brown sapwood. It is finely and uniformly textured; usually straight-grained. The wood is very hard, very heavy, tough, strong, elastic; very durable, even in contact with the soil, being very resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites, but susceptible to marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for internal purposes only, and needs to be done with care because of the density of the wood. The wood is used for several purposes, both internal and external. It is used for purposes such as sculpture, tool handles, industrial or heavy flooring, sliced veneer, stairs, furniture , ship building, wood frame house, bridges, posts, stakes, sleepers, heavy carpentry[386 , 848 ].","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas.
