See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in March, and the seeds ripen from May to July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and can grow in saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Bog Garden;,,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants grown in Britain tolerate drier conditions than their native habitat, but they still require plenty of moisture[11]. Plants are hardy as far north in America as Boston, Massachusetts[1]. They are unlikely to be fully hardy in all parts of Britain. Plants produce suckers[182]. Vegetative reproduction is predominant, forming large clones from adventitious buds on shallow roots[270]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","The seed germinates better if it is given 3 months cold stratification so is probably best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. The seed can also be sown in late winter in a greenhouse but the germination is variable[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Young plants should be overwintered in a greenhouse for their first year and can then be planted out in late spring after the last expected frosts[78]. Give some winter protection from the cold for their first year outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113].
