23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Specimen. Best grown in a warm position in a moderately rich free soil of an open texture[1]. Dislikes limey soils[11]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil but tolerates alkaline soils so long as they are deep and rich in humus[188]. The branches are brittle and the leaves very large, so a sheltered position is required[200, 229]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. Dormant mature plants are hardy to about -20°c[200] but the plants are apt to be damaged by late frosts when they are young[1]. Trees are slow-growing in the wild[229] and do not commence flowering until they are mature[245]. The leaves are very large and can be up to 80cm long by 25cm wide[229]. The flowers are sweetly scented[229, 245]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200].",
