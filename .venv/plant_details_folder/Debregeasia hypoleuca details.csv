See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",D. salicifolia. (D.Don.)Rendle.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[272].

Plants tolerate occasional lows to about -5°c[260]. This species is probably not very hardy in Britain and will probably require greenhouse protection, though it might be possible to grow it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, especially if it is given the protection of a warm wall. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruit is required.","Seed - sow late winter to mid-summer in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 2 months at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings in early summer[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
