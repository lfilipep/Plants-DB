Form: Rounded, Vase.","Celtis laevigata is a deciduous Tree growing to 18 m (59ft 1in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",C. integrifolia. C. mississippiensis.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[61, 105, 257]. The flesh is thin, dry and sweetish, covering a single large seed[149, 183]. The fruit, which is orange to brown or red when fully ripe, is 5 - 8mm in diameter[235, 270].","Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Succeeds in any reasonably good soil, preferring a good fertile well-drained loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds on dry gravels and on sandy soils[200]. Plants are usually found on clay soils in the wild[229]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Trees prefer hotter summers and more sunlight than are normally experienced in Britain, they often do not fully ripen their wood when growing in this country and they are then very subject to die-back in winter[1, 11, 200]. A very variable species, according to some botanists these merit varietal status whilst other botanists say that the differences are too slight[227]. Trees are moderate to fast-growing, probably living no more than 125 - 150 years[229]. They can be very long-lived according to another report, perhaps surviving for 1000 years[200]. Trees fruit heavily most years[229]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 3. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed is best given 2 - 3 months cold stratification and then sown February/March in a greenhouse[78, 200]. Germination rates are usually good, though the stored seed might take 12 months or more to germinate. The seed can be stored for up to 5 years[113]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The leaves of seedlings often have a lot of white patches without chlorophyll, this is normal and older plants produce normal green leaves. Grow the seedlings on in a cold frame for their first winter, and plant them out in the following late spring or early summer[K]. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
