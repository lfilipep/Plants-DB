0,Physalis hederaefolia cordifolia,Ground Cherry,Solanaceae,Coming soon,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where many of the members have poisonous leaves and stems, though the full ripe fruits are usually edible[19, 65].","Dry rocky and gravelly places, 1000 - 1600 metres in California[71].",South-western N. America.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Physalis hederaefolia cordifolia is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  It is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",P. hederaefolia fendleri. (Gray.)Cronq. P. fendleri. A.Gray.,Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Edible fruit - raw or cooked[46, 61, 105, 177, 257]. The fruit can also be boiled in a small amount of water, crushed and used as a condiment[257]. The plant conveniently wraps up each fruit in its own 'paper bag' (botanically, the calyx) to protect it from pests and the elements. This calyx is toxic and should not be eaten.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in the milder parts of this country. If it proves to be tender, it should be possible to treat it as an annual, sowing the seed in early spring in a warm greenhouse and planting out after the last expected frosts[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200].","Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170]. Division in spring[111]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in early summer[111]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
