It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Cladrastis amurensis.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Leaves: ,,"Young leaves - cooked[105, 177].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Succeeds in most soils and situations, including deep soils over chalk and dry soils[1, 200]. Prefers a good soil in a sunny position[1]. Prefers a well-drained sandy soil[245]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[200]. A polymorphic species[58]. It is closely related to the genus Cladrastis[200], and sometimes included in that genus[245]. Plants flower when quite young[200]. The flowers have a powerful scent of vanilla[245]. Transplants readily, even when fairly large[200], but the mature plants resent pruning[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water and then sow it in a cold frame in the autumn[200]. The seed can also be pre-soaked and sown in late winter in a greenhouse[78]. Variable germination. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings 4cm long in December.
