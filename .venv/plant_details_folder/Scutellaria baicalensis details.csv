Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antibacterial  Anticholesterolemic  Antipyretic  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Cancer  Cholagogue  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Haemostatic  Laxative  Nervine  Sedative  Stomachic  TB  Tonic  UrinaryBaikal skullcap is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs and is used primarily in treating ""hot and damp"" conditions such as dysentery and diarrhoea[218, 254]. It has been used medicinally for over 2,000 years and recent research has found that the roots contain flavonoids that greatly enhance liver function and also have anti-inflammatory and antiallergenic effects[238]. The root is anodyne, antibacterial, anticholesterolemic, antipyretic, antispasmodic, astringent, cholagogue, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, haemostatic, laxative, nervine, mildly sedative, stomachic and tonic (for TB)[46, 61, 147, 174, 176, 218, 238]. It reputedly calms the foetus in pregnant women[238]. The root is used internally in the treatment of enteritis, dysentery, diarrhoea, jaundice, chronic hepatitis, urinary tract infections, hypertension, threatened miscarriage, nosebleed and haemorrhage from the lungs or bowel[238]. It is one of the ingredients of the Chinese drug 'injection of three yellow herbs'[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn or spring from plants 3 - 4 years old and is dried for later use[238]. The seed is used to cleanse the bowels of blood and pus[218]. For the treatment of prostate cancer [301].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sunny position in any ordinary garden soil that does not dry out during the growing season[200]. Prefers a light well-drained soil in sun or partial shade[238]. This species requires sharp drainage and, once established, is drought tolerant[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238]. A very ornamental plant[1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow outdoors in situ in late spring[200] If there is only a small quantity of seed it is better to sow it in a pot in a cold frame in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring just before new growth begins. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",
