18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 11, 51, 105, 158, 272]. Up to 2.5cm in diameter[194]. The fruit is usually bletted[183], but even then it is not sweet[146]. Tasty when fully ripe, even when dried[194]. Our experience is that the fully ripe fruit has a reasonable flavour and, when bletted, is sweet and very pleasant[K]. A mature tree yields about 45kg of fruit per year[194]. The fruit contains about 6.8% sugars, 3.7% protein, 1% ash, 0.4% pectin. Vitamin C is very low, about 1.2mg per 100g[194]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentThe juice of the ripe fruit is used in the treatment of diarrhoea[272].
22,Other Uses,"Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"This plant can be used as a rootstock for the cultivated pear[194].  - compact fine grained, hard, durable, liable to split and warp during seasoning. Used for small implements, walking sticks and fuel[51, 158, 266]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year."
