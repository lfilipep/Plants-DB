Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Give the roots protection from winter frosts by mulching them[200]. At one time this plant was commonly cultivated as a dye plant[46, 61], but with the advent of chemical dyes it has fallen into disuse. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse, only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 weeks at 18°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in the spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well.
