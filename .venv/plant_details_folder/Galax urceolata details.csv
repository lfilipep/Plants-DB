23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden, Specimen, Woodland garden. Requires a moist humus-rich lime-free soil with part day shade[200]. Succeeds in full shade[208]. Plants can succeed in the dry shade of trees[233]. Succeeds in the woodland garden, large rock gardens or as an edging for shady paths[200]. Plants like an annual mulch of pine needles or other acid organic matter each spring[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring or autumn in a shaded cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady position in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division with care in early spring[200].",
