13,Summary,"Pau Brasil, Caesalpinia echinata, is a slow-growing small tree up to 12 m high found in South America. It has a large rounded crown and the branches, leaves, and fruits are thorned. When fully established, it is drought-tolerant. Bark is powdered and used as treatment for diarrhoea in children. Pods and wood are sources of black dye and red dye (brazilin), respectively. The wood is heavy, tough, hard, and durable and is used for turnery, building ship and making musical instruments like bows for violins. Other common names include Brazil Wood and Pernambuco tree. Common names: Brazilwood, Pernambuco tree. Portuguese: Pau-Brasil, Pau de Pernambuco; Tupi Ibirapitanga.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Caesalpinia echinata is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Odontalgic  TonicA charcoal made from the powdered bark is infused and used to treat diarrhoea in children[ 307 ]. The wood is odontalgic and tonic[ 739 ].,
20,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: High (4/5). Seaside, Small flowering Tree, Accent, Screening, Barrier, Large planter, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be trimmed to keep them small and dense[ 307 ]. This gives them potential for use as barrier plants[ 307 ]. Other Uses An infusion of the pods, mixed with iron sulphate, yields a permanent black dye[ 307 ]. A red dye is obtained from the wood[ 46 ]. It becomes purplish when mixed with alkalis and yellow if mixed with acids[ 46 ]. A fiery red colour, the dye was a very important item of trade until virtually replaced with synthetic dyes[ 349 ]. The heartwood is red-brown to dark brown; it is clearly differentiated from the thin layer of sapwood. The wood is fine-grained, very tough, hard, heavy and very durable[ 46 , 307 , 419 ]. Very dense, it sinks in water, is easy to split and to polish[ 46 ]. Of high value, the wood is used for turnery, ship building and making musical instruments[ 46 , 307 ]. It is particularly valued for making bows for violins[ 349 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained, alkaline soil and a position in full sun[ 307 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[ 307 ]. Plants are fairly tolerant of salt-laden winds[ 307 ]. A moderately fast-growing tree, reaching a height of up to 2 metres within 2 years from seed[ 419 ]. Plants begin to flower when around 3 - 4 years of age[ 349 ]. The development of heartwood in plantation trees is considerably faster than in the wild; the DBH of a 17 year old plantation tree compares with a 70 year old tree in the wild[ 349 ]. The quality of wood from plantations is, apparently, not suitable for making violin bows and consequently there is a lack of interest in growing the species in plantation[ 349 ]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[ 307 ]. Trees in the wild are frequently covered with orchids and other epiphytes[ 349 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[ 200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 200 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 12 - 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing. Sow the seed in a partially shaded position in individual containers. A germination rate in excess of 60% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 8 - 15 days[ 419 ]. When the seedlings are 4 - 6cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 4 - 5 months later[ 419 ]. Seeds must be sown fresh, they fail to germinate after storage for 30 days[ 349 ]. Softwood cuttings in sand in a frame[ 200 ]. This plant may be considered a protected species; check before digging or gathering seeds.",
