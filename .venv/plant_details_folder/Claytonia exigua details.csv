25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species but judging by its native range it should be possible to grow it as a hardy annual in Britain. It is closely allied to M. perfoliata (a species that is naturalized in Britain) and probably has the same cultivation requirements as listed below. Prefers a moist peaty soil[1, 60]. Plants can succeed on very poor and dry soils and in the shade of trees[52, 60].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring or autumn in situ. The seed usually germinates rapidly.,
