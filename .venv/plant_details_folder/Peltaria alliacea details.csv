A strong flavour, somewhat like a cross between garlic and mustard, the leaves make a reasonable flavouring for salads[K]. The leaves are available for most of the year, even in a severe winter they remain green and lush[K]. At this time they add an especially welcome spiciness to salads[K]. They can become rather bitter in the summer, though, especially if the plants are in a dry sunny position[K]. When flowering in early summer, the plants lose their leaves for a month or two - cutting down the flowering stems at this time will induce new fresh green growth[K]. Flowers - raw. A similar flavour to the leaves, with very little bitterness, they make a very tasty addition to summer salads[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The seed germinates rapidly, prick the seedlings out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer[K].

Divisions in the winter should be potted up in a greenhouse to allow themselves to establish, they can then be planted out in late spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
