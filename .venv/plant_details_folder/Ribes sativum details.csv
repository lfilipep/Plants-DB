13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Ribes sativum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked in jams, compotes, jellies, puddings, pies etc[183, 200]. An acid taste that many people find too strong to eat raw, the fruit makes an excellent jam or preserves[K]. The fruit is rich in vitamin C[183]. There are rather a lot of seeds in each fruit[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. Plants are quite tolerant of shade, succeeding on an east or even a north-facing wall, though not fruiting so well in such a position[11]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 to 6[200]. Hardy to about -20c[200]. There is some confusion in nomenclature with some botanists recognising 2 species of red currants, this species and R. spicatum (syn R. rubrum), whilst others say that R. rubrum is a distinct species[17, 200]. The red currant is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. Most cultivars are self-fertile and set a good crop on their own[200]. The fruit is produced at the base of one-year old and older wood, plants start to fruit at 3 - 4 years from seed[200]. Red currant fruits are an absolute magnet for birds and so the plants will usually need some protection to allow the crop to ripen[K]. Alternatively, you can put this attraction for the birds to good use by planting red currants specifically for the birds. Whilst they are eating these fruits they will not be eating your other fruits[K]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at between 0 and 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200]."
