22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1, 200]. Prefers a deep well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. There are 3 sub-species of this species, 2 of them are calcicole (growing well in alkaline soils), whilst the third, L. rhapontica rhapontica, is calcifuge and requires a lime-free soil[50]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a cold frame and only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring."
