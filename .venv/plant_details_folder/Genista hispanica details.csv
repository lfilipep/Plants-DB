See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Ground Cover; Hedge;,None known,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DiureticThe flowers have been used in the treatment of dropsy[4].,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",Plants can be grown as a low hedge[29]. A good ground cover for sunny positions[190]. Plants take about 2 years to form an effective cover[197]. They should be spaced about 60cm apart each way and can be pruned back hard if they become open or straggly with age[208].,,"Easily grown in a light well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. Prefers a rather dry stony or sandy soil and does better in one on the poor side[11]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. Resents root disturbance and should be planted into its permanent position whilst small[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], it grows well on the top of walls and on hot dry banks, covering them with a dense mass of prickly greenery[182]. The flowers have a sweet refreshing perfume, like ripe apples or pineapples[245]. Plants occasionally die back in the centre of the clump, especially after cold wet winters. Cut out the dead growth and layer living shoots into the gap[200]. Closely related to G. tournefortii. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown autumn in a cold frame. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow February in a cold frame. Good germination[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Roots are formed in the spring[11]. Cuttings of ripe wood, 5 - 10 cm with a heel, September/October in a frame. Good percentage. Plant out the following autumn[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
