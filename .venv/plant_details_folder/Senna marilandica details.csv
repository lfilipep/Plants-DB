19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Cathartic  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Poultice  VermifugeThe leaves and seedpods are cathartic, diuretic and vermifuge[1, 11, 21, 46]. The leaves are harvested before and during flowering, the pods are harvested when fully ripe in the autumn. Both are dried for later use[238]. The leaves are a safe and effective cathartic[207, 213]. They are best used with Foeniculum vulgare seeds in order to counteract a tendency to cause gripe[207, 213]. The seedpods can also be used and are milder but slower in their action[222]. The seeds have been soaked in water until they are mucilaginous and then swallowed as a treatment for sore throats[213, 257]. The root is cardiac and febrifuge[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of fevers and heart problems[257]. A poultice of the root has been used in treating sores[257].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most well-drained soils but prefers an open sandy loam in a sunny sheltered position[1, 11, 200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Succeeds in light shade, but the plant is much less vigorous when grown in dry shade[200]. Although fairly cold-tolerant, plants can be killed in very severe weather, so it is best to mulch the roots of mature plants in bad winters[11]. Younger plants should be mulched each winter until they are well established[200]. Slugs are very attracted to this plant[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - scarify and then pre-soak the seed for 2 - 3 hours in warm water before sowing it from early spring to early summer in a warm greenhouse[138]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 12 weeks at 23°c[138]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse. Do not plant them out until the following spring[138]. Division as growth commences in spring[11]. Cuttings of moderately ripe wood, July in a frame[1].",
