24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,700 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range of 22 - 28°c but can tolerate 10° - 32°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive occasional short-lived temperatures down to about -3°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418 ]. Mature trees have moderate drought tolerance. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range of 900 - 1,500mm but tolerates 700 - 1,700mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position[625 ]. Prefers fertile, deep, well-drained, humus-rich, mildly acid soil[200, 335 ]. Tolerant of moderate levels of salt in the soil[418 ]. Plants have a high requirement for iron[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range of 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418 ]. Newly planted young trees are quite slow to establish and grow away[625 ]. Plants commence fruiting about 6 - 10 years from seed and four years from layering[307, 335 ]. In warm tropical and subtropical areas with light rainfall, the plant can produce 5 or 6 crops each year[200 ]. The flowers and fruits are formed on the trunk and branches[307 ]. Plants have a compact, fibrous root system and transplant well[307 ]. There is at least one named form[301 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a short viability and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe. Sow in a semi-shaded position in a nursery seedbed. Germination rates can be 90% or more, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 35 days[625 ]. The seedlings grow quite slowly[625 ]. Cuttings Side-veneer grafting"
