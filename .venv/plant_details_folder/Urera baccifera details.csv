4,Known Hazards,"This is one of the best known plants of Guatemala and all Central America, one known and probably physically so, to all Central Americans, for it is one of the most severely stinging plants that exist in the Americas[331 ]. The large spine-like prickles are hollow and filled with liquid. When one brushes against a branch or a leaf, the prickles penetrate the flesh and cause the most excruciating pain, as sudden as an electric shock, that may last two or three days. The pain gradually disappears, to be followed by numbness in the affected part. It is needless to explain why the shrub makes an effective hedge plant!!![331 ].(Parts of plant are poisonous if ingested)",
5,Habitats,"Common or abundant in wet or dry thickets, often in secondary growth, mostly in the lowlands at elevations up to 850 metres, but occurring also at higher elevations in Guatemala possibly because it was planted[331 ].",

18,Medicinal Uses,"Antiarthritic: Treats arthritis.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stings: Used in the treatment of stings and insect bites.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiarthritic  Antibacterial  Diuretic  Skin  StingsAn infusion of the fresh leaves is diuretic[528 ]. The leaves are used in the treatment of muscle pain. A leaf is held by its petiole and the nettles are brushed against the skin[521 ]. This causes an excruciating pain, gradually replaced over the following days by a numbness!!![K ]. The Waorani also use this plant to relieve tainting and all pain, including that from aching muscles, arthritis, pulled muscles, snakebite, stingray and stings of the conga, a/teea and fire ants. The roots are said in the Colombian Amazon to have antihaemorrhagic properties, and an infusion of the leaves alleviates erysipelas[697 ]. A decoction of the roots is employed in treating gonorrhea[697 ]. A decoction of the root is diuretic[528 ].",
20,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: When one brushes against a branch or a leaf of this plant, the prickles penetrate the flesh and cause the most excruciating pain. It is needless to explain why the shrub makes such an effective hedge plant, and for this purpose it is widely planted in the Americas. Horses fear it, and few other large animals will attempt to penetrate such hedges, which are far from being things of beauty. Only in the early part of the rainy season, when the new foliage has developed, are the hedges at all presentable. During the height of the dry season they lose their leaves and are unsightly[331 ]. The plant has been shown to build up to high populations in a fire-disturbed forest in the Atlantic forest in southern Brazil through a high recruitment rate and low mortality. The seeds are disbursed by birds[692 ]. Other Uses  from the branches has been used for making rope, twine and paper[331 , 692 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Widespread throughout the moister American tropics and into the subtropics, this species is generaly not found in areas with a mean annual rainfall of less than 1,600mm, preferring the range 2,000 - 4,000mm[692 ]. Prefers a sunny position[200 ], tolerating some shade but dying out in heavier shade[692 ]. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions from acid to calcareous; growing in well-drained to somewhat poorly drained soils of all textures[692 ]. The plant is considered a weed when growing in shaded coffee plantations; however it has never been found naturalized outside its native range[692 ]. When stems are cut during site management activities they quickly sprout and regain their former height. Whether sprouting from the rootstalk occurs after senescence and death of individual stems is not known[692 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required.",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - when sown fesh it can germinate in 26 days or more with around 49% sprouting[692 ]. Cuttings are easy - even thick branches take root quickly when set in the ground[331 ].,
