13,Summary,"A fast-growing tropical tree that grows up to 12 m in height, Cypre or Cordia alliodora has a compact crown and straight stem, and is capable of self-pruning. The trunk is smooth and light coloured. Other common names are Ecuador laurel and Spanish elm. The ellipsoid fruits are edible but not scrumptious. The bark is used as condiment. The leaves are used medicinally particularly in the treatment of catarrh and various lung ailments. Seeds are pulverised and used as treatment for skin conditions. Cypre is wind resistant and readily inhabits bare soil making it an ideal pioneer species. The wood is moderately durable, resistant to fungus and termites attacks, and produces an attractive finish."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cordia alliodora is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies), bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments."
19,Edible Uses Description,"are edible[ 46 , 301 ]. Not very tasty[ 310 ]. The ellipsoid fruit is 5 - 7mm long and about 2mm wide[ 485 ]. The bark is used as a condiment[ 301 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Skin  Stimulant  Stomachic  TonicThe leaves are stimulant, stomachic and tonic[ 46 , 411 ]. A decoction is used in the treatment of catarrh and lung conditions[ 46 , 411 ]. An ointment made from the pulverised seeds is used in the treatment of skin diseases[ 46 , 411 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Cypre is a pioneer species that is very wind resistant and readily colonizes bare soils[ 310 ]. Fast growing, it can be used to commence the process of restoring native woodland to an area[ K ]. Because of its tall, straight stem, self-pruning habit and compact crown, combined with the ease with which it regenerates naturally on cleared sites and its positive effect upon soil conditions, it is commonly grown in association with many agricultural crops and in numerous agroforestry systems, eg as a shade tree in coffee and cocoa plantations and in pastures, often in combination with Erythrina poeppigiana[ 310 , 317 ]. Other Uses: The heartwood is dark brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the thick layer of slightly lighter coloured sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain is slightly interlocked; lustre is medium; odour and taste are indistinct. The wood is moderately durable, being resistant to fungus attacks and with good resistance to termites. It is easy to season and work, and produces an attractive finish (pale golden-brown to brown with darker streaks). It has dimensional stability when dry, satisfactory mechanical characteristics. Of high quality, the wood is used in construction for making doors, window frames, panelling, flooring etc; it is also used for furniture, cabinet work, turnery, carving, scientific instruments, boats (including bridge decking), oars, sleepers and veneer[ 46 , 310 , 363 , 411 ]. Smaller branches are used for making barrel hoops[ 411 ]. The wood is used for fuel and making charcoal[ 310 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A tree of the lowland tropics, normally at elevations below 1,000 metres but occasionally found as high as 2,000 metres[ 310 ]. It grows best in areas where the annual rainfall exceeds 2,000mm, but will also perform reasonably well with an annual rainfall as low as 750mm[ 310 ]. It prefers a mean annual temperature of around 24°c[ 310 ]. Plants are tolerant of a range of soil types, preferring moist but freely draining fertile soils[ 310 ]. It is particularly suitable for calcareous soils in the more humid tropics[ 310 ]. Growth on degraded soils and on sites with poor drainage is reduced[ 310 ]. Requires a position in full sun[ 200 ]. Plants are fairly tolerant of very windy conditions, showing less damage when exposed to hurricane winds than most species[ 310 ]. The tree has been introduced into several areas for forestry. Its seeds are carried by the wind and the plant has escaped from cultivation in some of these areas and is showing every sign of becoming a problem[ 305 ]. The crushed leaves and the fresh bark smell of garlic[ 307 , 411 ]. A fast-growing tree, on suitable sites, with good management, an annual height increase of 2 metres, coupled with 2 cm increase in diameter may be obtained during the first 10 years[ 310 ]. A height of 30 - 40 metres and diameter of 40 - 55 cm at breast height are predicted for rotations of 20 - 25 years[ 310 ]. Seedlings develop a strong taproot. Later, spreading roots also develop which may grow into buttresses[ 310 ]. Flowering may start when the trees are only 2 years old, but more commonly between 5 - 10 years after planting[ 310 ]. Plants can flower all year round when growing near the equator, but become seasonal when growing further away[ 325 ]. Because of its abundant nectar, bees are strongly attracted to this plant[ 307 ]. The tree has a high degree of self-incompatibility[ 310 ]. The mature fruit is shed with the withered flower still attached, which acts as a parachute during fruit fall, possibly assisting wind dispersal[ 310 ]. When harvesting seed for propagation it is important to only harvest mature seed. This is best done by shaking the branches to allow mature seed with a high viability rate to drop off[ 310 ]. Young to middle-aged trees coppice readily and suckers are sometimes abundant[ 310 ]. The bole is generally straight and cylindrical and often clear of branches 50 - 60% of the total tree height, even in open, uncrowded conditions[ 310 ]. When grown as a shade tree in plantations, this species reduces the yield of the main crop, such as cocoa, but the extra income generated from the timber eventually compensates for this yield reduction[ 310 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - the hard seed needs scarifying by lightly abrading the seedcoat before sowing[ 307 ]. Germination usually takes place in 5 - 20 days with up to 80% of the seed germinating[ 310 ]. The seed can be sown in trays, transplanting the seedlings when they are about 3 weeks old to nursery beds[ 325 ]. They are planted out into their permanent positions about 6 months later[ 325 ]. The seed has a short viability under natural conditions; but dried to below 10% moisture it may be stored at 2°c for up to 10 years[ 310 ]. Cuttings."
