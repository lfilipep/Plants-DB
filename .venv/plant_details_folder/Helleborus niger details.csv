As such it should not be taken except under professional supervision. The plant contains cardiac glycosides which have a similar action to the foxglove (Digitalis spp) and it has been used as a heart stimulant for the elderly, though this treatment is no longer recommended[254]. The root is anthelmintic, cardiac, cathartic, diuretic, emetic, emmenagogue, irritant, violently narcotic and a drastic purgative[4, 9, 21, 46, 240]. It is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[4]. It has been used in the treatment of dropsy, amenorrhoea, nervous disorders and hysteria, but it is very poisonous and great care must be taken over the dosage[4]. The root is also applied externally as a local irritant[4], but even this should be done with care, see notes above on toxicity. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[9]. It is used in the treatment of headaches, psychic disorders, enteritis and spasms[9].","Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.","Used as a parasiticide against body lice, fleas etc[76].

Succeeds in any good garden soil[1], growing and flowering best in a moist well-drained rich loam in a sheltered position in partial shade[1, 4, 31, 111, 244]. Succeeds when grown in the shade of a north-facing wall[233]. Does not object to lime[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[200]. Dislikes drought. Slugs are very fond of this plant and it will probably require some protection from them[187]. The various species in this genus hybridize freely[95]. Plants can flower in three years from seed[4]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[187]. Plants resent root disturbance and are slow to re-establish when divided[244]. They are best left undisturbed for 6 - 7 years before being divided[244]. Seedling plants should be placed in their permanent positions whilst still small[200]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1, 134]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible[1], it usually germinates in the autumn to spring. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This species produces flowering plants in 2 - 3 years from seed[200]. Division after flowering or in autumn.
