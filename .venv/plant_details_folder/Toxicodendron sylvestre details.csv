0,Toxicodendron sylvestre,Yame-haze,Anacardiaceae,9-12,"Species in the genus Toxicodendron are known to contain resinous phenolic compounds known as urushiols that can cause severe skin problems in humans. Direct contacr with the plant, exposure to smoke or fumes from a burning plant or even contact with pets, animals or cothing that have touched the plant can cause severe allergic dermatitis in some individuals. There is usually a latent period of about 12 - 24 hours from the moment of contact, this is followed by a reddening and severe blistering of the skin. Even plant specimens 100 or more years old have been known to cause problems [274 ]. The plant does not cause skin problems with wildlife or livestock - the foliage and fruits are eaten by several other species of animals and birds - though some pets are sensitive to it [1050 ].","Low mountains, C. and S.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. The flowers are pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Rhus sylvestris Siebold & Zucc.,,None Known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"The leaves are rich in tannin. They can be collected as they fall in the autumn and used as a brown dye or as a mordant[169 ]. An oil is extracted from the seeds [4 , 61 ]. It attains a tallow-like consistency on standing and is used to make candles. These burn brilliantly, though they emit a pungent smoke[4 ]. The oblique, compressed drupe is around 8mm x 6 - 7mm, with a thick, waxy mesocarp [266 ]. A lacquer is obtained from the sap of this plant [46 , 61 ]. One report says that this species does not yield a varnish [11 ]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: oil, gum (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1].","Industrial Crop: Gum: Used as thickeners and gelling agents. Non-destructively harvested gums come from tapped trees and seed.,Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Gum  Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: Standard  Regional CropClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: humid. Toxicodendron sylvestre is only hardy outdoors in the milder regions of the temperaste zone. The young growth in spring is very susceptible to cold and can be damaged by late frosts. Species in this genus generally succeed in a well-drained fertile or moderately fertile soil in full sun or light shade [11 , 200 ]. Plants have brittle branches and these can be broken off in strong winds [200 ]. Plants are also susceptible to coral spot fungus [11 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. A dioecious species - both male and female forms must be grown if fruit and seed are required.  Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seed. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water (starting at a temperature of 80 - 90c and allowing it to cool) prior to sowing in order to leach out any germination inhibitors[200 ]. The stored seed also needs hot water treatment and can be sown in early spring [200 ]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10cm with a heel, mid summer in a frame[200 ]. Root cuttings 4cm long taken in mid-winter and potted up. Good percentage[78 , 200 ]. Suckers in late autumn to winter[200 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
