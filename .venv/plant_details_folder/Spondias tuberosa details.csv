The climate is hot and dry, there are usually 6 to 11 months without rain each year. The mean annual rainfall varies from 250 - 1,000mm, and the mean annual temperature is from 24 - 26°c. The plant grows best in the subhumid and frost-free tropics[200 ]. Grows well in areas with a prolonged dry period[335 ]. Requires a sunny position[419 ]. Plants are not too fussy over soil, not needing very fertile conditions[200 ]. However, very poor soil, or shallow land, is unsuitable[200 ]. Established plants are very tolerant of dry conditions, able to withstand extended periods of drought[335 , 419 ]. The plant can store starch and water in special storage organs in the roots, known as 'tuberous aquifers'. This makes it able to withstand very long periods of drought[419 ]. A pH in the range 6 - 7 is ideal[200 ]. A slow growing tree[419 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring.
