The leaves can be eaten, or a poultice of the warmed leaves applied to the breasts, in order to stimulate the milk flow of a nursing mother[257]. The juice of the leaves and stems has been rubbed over bleeding wounds to stop the bleeding[257]. A decoction of the stems has been drunk by a woman in the ninth month of her pregnancy in order to ease childbirth[257]. A decoction of the whole plant has been given to children as a treatment for constipation and has been used as a wash to soothe nervous and irritable babies[257]. The plant is used as a treatment for sore gums[257].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden, Seashore. A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates some shade[188]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Succeeds in poor soils and on walls[200]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species, such as this one, that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",
