25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropAgave vivipara is a stemless, succulent plant. Requires a sunny position[423]. Requires a well-drained soil[423]. Succeeds in poor soils[423]. Established plants are very drought resistant[423]. A monocarpic species - the plant lives for a number of years without flowering but dies once it does flower. However, it normally produces plenty of suckers during its life and these continue growing, taking about 10 - 15 years in a warm climate, considerably longer in colder ones, before flowering[11]. Climate: subtropical to tropical. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - surface sow in a container in a light position. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20Â°c[133 ]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of well-drained soil when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a sunny position until they are at least 20cm tall. Division of suckers. Bulbils.,
