19,Edible Uses Description,"it - raw or cooked[183]. The fruits are small and smooth, either oval or cylindrical in shape with a mealy, somewhat insipid or slightly sour flesh[183]. They are eaten when young and still tender, either raw or cooked as a vegetable. Ripe fruits are used for dessert[183]. Seed - raw[57, 86, 105]. Rich in oil with a nutty flavour but very fiddly to use because the seed is small and covered with a fibrous coat[K]. The seed contains between 12.5 - 39.1% oil[218]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[105, 183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The fruits can be used as a cooling light cleanser or moisturiser for the skin[201]. They are also used as a first aid treatment for burns and abrasions[201]. The flowers are expectorant and emetic[218]. The fruit is stomachic[218]. The seed is antitussive, digestive, febrifuge and vermifuge[218]. When used as a vermifuge, the whole seed complete with the seed coat is ground into a fine flour, then made into an emulsion with water and eaten. It is then necessary to take a purge in order to expel the tapeworms or other parasites from the body[7]. The root is diuretic and emetic[218].",
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich, well-drained moisture retentive soil and a warm, very sunny position[200]. A frost-tender annual plant, the snap melon is occasionally cultivated, especially in warmer climates than Britain, for its edible fruit. This form is also of value in breeding programmes for pest and disease resistance. Some varieties may succeed outdoors in Britain in hot summers but in general it is best to grow melons under protection in this country[1, 200]. Grows well with corn and sunflowers but dislikes potatoes[20, 201]. The weeds fat hen and sow thistle improve the growth and cropping of melons[201].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse in a rich soil. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Sow 2 or 3 seeds per pot and thin out to the best plant. Grow them on fast and plant out after the last expected frosts, giving them cloche or frame protection for at least their first few weeks if you are trying them outdoors.",
