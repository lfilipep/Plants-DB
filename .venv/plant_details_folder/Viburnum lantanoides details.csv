0,Viburnum lantanoides,Hobbleberry,Adoxaceae,3-7,None known,"Moist woods and shady ravines[43, 62].","Eastern N. America - New Brunswick to North Carolina, Ontario, Tennessee and Michigan.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ViburnumLantanoides.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ViburnumLantanoides2.jpg",,"Viburnum lantanoides is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",V. alnifolium.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 62, 65]. Sweet and palatable, tasting somewhat like raisins or dates[101, 105, 183]. The fruits have a large seed and a thin flesh[183]. The taste is best after a frost[62, 65]. The ovoid fruit is about 15mm long and contains a single large seed[200].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Infertility: Used in treating problems of human fertility.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Blood purifier  InfertilityThe leaves are analgesic[257]. They have been mashed and applied to the head as a poultice to ease a migraine[257]. A decoction of the roots has been used as a blood medicine[257]. The decoction has been used as a fertility aid by women[257].,,None known,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but is ill-adapted for poor soils and for dry situations[1]. It prefers a deep rich loamy soil in a shady position[11]. Requires a moist acid soil and woodland conditions but without competition from other plants[11, 184, 200]. Another report says that it requires an exposed position[3]. Dislikes alkaline soils[184]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[184]. Plants are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200]. Plants are often self-layering in the wild and form thickets[184]. This species is closely related to V. furcatum[184].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
