0,Gypsophila oldhamiana,"Manchurian Baby's Breath, Oldham's baby's-breath",Caryophyllaceae,Coming soon,"Although no mention has been seen for this species, at least one member of this genus has a root that is rich in saponins[2]. Although toxic, these substances are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm[65]. They are also broken down by heat so a long slow baking can destroy them. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Scrub, mountain slope grasslands, rocks and maritime sands from sea level to 2,000 metres[266].","E.

When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and, if growth is sufficient, plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. If the plants are too small to plant out, grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings before the plant flowers. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.
