See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",S. nigra.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,Fruit: ,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 183].

Prefers a slightly acid soil but tolerates some alkalinity if plenty of organic matter is added to the soil[200]. Requires some protection from the most intense sunlight[200]. Plants are intolerant of drought[K]. This species has not been properly evaluated for hardiness in Britain but it will probably succeed outdoors in most parts of the country[11], especially if given the protection of a woodland or a wall[K]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200, 238]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a greenhouse in the spring[238]. Germination can be slow and erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for their first 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Overwinter in the greenhouse and plant out in late spring[11, 78]. Good percentage[78]. Layering of long shoots in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
