Trees are very hardy when grown in a continental climate with long hot summers but in the cooler climate of Britain where they do not always ripen their wood they are only reliably hardy to about -5°c[200]. They grow well on a south-facing wall[11, 200] and this is the only way to ensure that they fruit well in Britain[1]. A plant growing in a sunny position on the south side of tree cover at Kew was 3.5 metres tall in spring 1995 and looked healthy[K]. Occasionally cultivated, especially in China[46], for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. There is a disagreement over the correct name for this species, with some authorities using Pseudocydonia sinensis[11, 200] and others Chaenomeles sinensis[266].
