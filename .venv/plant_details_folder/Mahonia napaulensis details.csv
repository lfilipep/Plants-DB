13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Mahonia napaulensis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 3 m (9ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[272]. An acid flavour, but it is rather nice raw especially when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. The fruit can also be dried and used as raisins[2, 51, 158, 177]. The ovoid fruit is about 12mm long[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Dysentery  Ophthalmic  TonicThe fruits are said to be diuretic and demulcent[240, 272]. They are used in the treatment of dysentery[240]. A decoction of the bark is used as eye drops to treat inflammations of the eyes[272]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the stem and leaves[61].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it thrives in any good garden soil[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a semi-shaded woodland position in a damp slightly acid to neutral humus rich soil[200]. Requires a position sheltered from cold or strong winds[1]. The plant is slightly tender in Britain[1] though it does well in Cornwall[59]. It under performs in areas where temperatures regularly fall below -10°c[200]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts[K]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. The flowers have a delicate sweet fragrance[245]. At least one named variety has been developed for its ornamental value. 'Maharajah' appears to be hardier than the type species[182]. Closely allied to M. acanthifolia[11] (which is quoted as a synonym of this species in some books). The differences stated between the two species do not hold true in the wild but in cultivation M. acanthifolia has leaflets with a dull surface, flowers in the autumn and is hardier than many of the spring flowering introductions of M. nepaulensis. Resistant to honey fungus[88]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half ripe wood 15cm long, July in individual pots in a frame[78]. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11]. Leaf cuttings in the autumn."
