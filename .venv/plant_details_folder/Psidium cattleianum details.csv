13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Psidium cattleianum is an evergreen Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 3, 61]. The fruit can be used in jellies, jams, custards, drinks etc[183]. Sweet and aromatic. The flavour is more pronounced than that of the yellow strawberry guava but lacks the muskiness of the common guava[183]. The fruit has an agreeable acid-sweet flavour and is good when eaten raw[2, 46], though it can also be used in preserves[177]. The fruit is about 4cm in diameter[200]. Fruit and processed products are traded locally throughout the tropics and subtropics and although the economic importance of P. cattleianum remains low, it can become significant when it is cultivated (e.g. on Réunion). Its cultivation has been tested in Spain (Salinero Corral and Aguin Casal, 1993, 1996) and in Réunion (Normand, 1994, 2002b) where it is now a profitable crop. In contrast to the fruit from P. guajava, P. cattleianum fruit are not rich in vitamin C, with only 11-50 mg per 100 g [1-8]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  AstringentLeaves contain compounds active against antibiotic-resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria which are important human pathogens. They contain flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and essential oils, mainly b-caryophyllene. Fruit and leaves are used in traditional medicine against haemorrhage, diarrhoea and colic. Leaves are a source of essential oils produced after distillation [1-8]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Grown as a fruiting hedge in warm temperate climates[200]. P. cattleianum is grown as an ornamental (garden tree or hedge tree) in the tropics and sub-tropics because of its slow growth, its pleasant dark green and shiny foliage and its tasty fruit. Fuel.  Oil [1-8]. Poultry forage. Windbreak."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained sandy loam with leaf mold [1]. Requires cool greenhouse treatment in Britain[1]. Tolerates short-lived light frosts[200] and cool summers[3] so it might succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country. Hardier to cold than the common guava. Dislikes much humidity. Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. Special soil tolerances: infertile, shallow [1-8]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. If trying the plants outdoors, plant them out in the summer and give them some protection from winter cold for at least their first two winters. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame."
