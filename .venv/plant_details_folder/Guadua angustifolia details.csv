19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,
20,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"& crafts work, raw construction material, panels (plywood, laminates, floors), bio-energy industry, musical instruments, houses, etc. Guadua meets the International Building Code (IBC) . Too big for pots and containers. A good ornamental bamboo. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. : bank.",
22,Cultivation Details,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Regional CropClimate: subtropical to tropical. Humidity: humid. Minimum temperature tolerance: -2°C. Prefers tropical or subtropical climates, but still tolerates some frost. Full sun. Moist, well drained soil. Soil pH requirements: 5.6 (acidic) to 7.5 (neutral). Normal growing conditions in the central region of the Andes, between 900 and 1,600 meters above sea level, at temperatures between 20° and 26° Centigrade, rainfalls of 2,000 - 2,500 mm/year, a relative humidity of 75 - 85% and on alluvial soils that are rich in volcanic ash with a moderate fertility and good drainage. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: managed multistem (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
