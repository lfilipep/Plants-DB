See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds; East Wall.

Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Diuretic  Epilepsy  Hallucinogenic  Hypnotic  Mydriatic  Narcotic  Sedative  UrinaryHenbane has a very long history of use as a medicinal herb, and has been widely cultivated to meet the demand for its use[4]. It is used extensively as a sedative and pain killer and is specifically used for pain affecting the urinary tract, especially when due to kidney stones[254]. Its sedative and antispasmodic effect makes it a valuable treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, relieving tremor and rigidity during the early stages of the disease[254]. This species is generally considered the best for internal use, whilst the black henbane (H. niger) is the form most used externally[4]. All parts of the plant, but especially the leaves and the seeds, can be used - they are anodyne, antispasmodic, mildly diuretic, hallucinogenic, hypnotic, mydriatic, narcotic and sedative[4, 9, 13, 21, 100, 165, 192, 218]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of asthma, whooping cough, motion sickness, Meniere's syndrome, tremor in senility or paralysis and as a pre-operative medication[238]. Henbane reduces mucous secretions, as well as saliva and other digestive juices[254]. Externally, it is used as an oil to relieve painful conditions such as neuralgia, dental and rheumatic pains[238, 254].The leaves should be harvested when the plant is in full flower and they can then be dried for later use[4]. This is a very poisonous plant that should be used with great caution, and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[21, 238]. See the notes above on toxicity. The seed is used in the treatment of asthma, cough, epilepsy, myalgia and toothache[218].",,None known,,"Prefers a hot dry position[200] in a wall or rock crevice[187]. Succeeds in a well-drained fertile soil, preferably of an alkaline nature, in full sun[200]. Grows well in maritime areas[200]. Plants are possibly hardy to about -10°c[187], they are unlikely to succeed in the colder areas of Britain. Self-sows freely, it can be grown in wild informal areas of the garden[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, older seed rapidly loses viability[200]. Either sow in situ or pot up the seedlings whilst still small because plants produce a long taproot and older plants resent root disturbance[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
