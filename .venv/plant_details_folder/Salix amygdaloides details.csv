0,Salix amygdaloides,Peach Leaved Willow,Salicaceae,4-8,None known,"Along muddy streambanks and in low wet woods bordering rivers, to 2100 metres[229].","N. America - British Columbia to New York, south to Texas.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixAmygdaloides.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixAmygdaloides2.jpg",,"Salix amygdaloides is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Salix wrightii Andersson,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Astringent  FebrifugeAn infusion of the bark shavings has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea and stomach ailments[257]. A poultice of the bark has been applied to bleeding cuts[257]. A decoction of the branch tips has been used as a soak for treating cramps in the legs and feet[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The bark is a source of tannin[226]. A light brown dye is obtained from the bark[226]. The young stems are very flexible and can be used in basket making[257]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The tenacious root system of this tree makes it very useful for preventing soil erosion along the banks of rivers etc[226]. It is also a good pioneer species, readily invading any cleared-out area if there is sufficient moisture[226, 229]. It is short-lived and not very shade tolerant and so, having provided good conditions for other woodland trees to become established, it is eventually out-competed by them[K].  - light, close-grained, soft, weak[82, 226, 229, 235]. It weighs 28lb per cubic foot[235]. It is sometimes cut for timber which is used for fence posts, but its uses are mainly limited to charcoal and firewood[226, 229]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A fast-growing but relatively short-lived species in the wild[229]. A good bee plant, providing an early source of nectar[11]. Trees are impatient of root disturbance and should be moved regularly before being planted in their permanent positions, which is best done whilst the plants are young[11]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
