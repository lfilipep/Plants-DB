The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in almost any soil[1], though it prefers a moist soil[27].","Seed - these notes are based on C. bulbosum, they might not apply to this species. Best sown in the autumn in situ[33]. The seed has a very short viability[1] or, according to another report, the seed becomes dormant if allowed to dry out and will not germinate for a year[164]. If stored for a spring sowing it should be kept in damp sand in a cold but frost-free place and then sown in situ in March[1]. Another alternative is to sow the seed in the autumn in a seed tray in a cold frame and then to sow the seed, soil and all, in early April in situ[164].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
