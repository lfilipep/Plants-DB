21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antidote  Antiflatulent  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Appetizer  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Digestive  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Hepatic  Stimulant  TB  TonicWhite horehound is a well-known and popular herbal medicine that is often used as a domestic remedy for coughs, colds, wheeziness etc[4, 254]. The herb apparently causes the secretion of a more fluid mucous, readily cleared by coughing[254]. The leaves and young flowering stems are antiseptic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emmenagogue, strongly expectorant, hepatic, stimulant and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 165, 238]. Horehound is a very valuable pectoral, expectorant and tonic that can be safely used by children as well as adults[4]. It is often made into a syrup or candy in order to disguise its very bitter flavour, though it can also be taken as a tea[4]. As a bitter tonic, it increases the appetite and supports the function of the stomach[254]. It can also act to normalize heart rhythm[254]. The plant is harvested as it comes into flower and can be used fresh or dried[238]. The root is a remedy for the bite of rattlesnakes, it is used in equal portions with Plantago lanceolata or P. major[207]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Marrubium vulgare for dyspepsia, loss of appetite (see [302] for critics of commission E)."
22,Other Uses,"Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the plant and used as a flavouring in liqueurs[46]. The plant has been used as a cure for cankerworm in trees[238]. No more details are given but it is probably a strong infusion of the flowering shoots, or the essential oil, that is used[K]. The growing plant repels flies[201]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"White horehound is an easily grown plant that succeeds in most well-drained soils[200], though it flourishes best in a poor dry soil[1, 4]. Another report says that the plant flourishes best where there is plenty of nitrogen in the soil[274]. It prefers neutral to alkaline soil conditions[238] and requires a warm sunny position if it is to do well[14]. Often grown in the herb garden and sometimes cultivated commercially as a medicinal herb[4, 61]. If the plant is cut back after flowering it will normally produce a second crop of leaves[238]. The fresh leaves have a pronounced musky smell, though this is lost once the plant is dried[245]. A good bee plant[1]. White horehound is a good companion plant for growing near tomatoes[24]. The tomatoes crop for a longer period and also produce a heavier crop[201]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April/May or August/September in a cold frame. Germination can be slow and erratic[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the following spring[K]. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
