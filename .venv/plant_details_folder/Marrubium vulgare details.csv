Another report says that the plant flourishes best where there is plenty of nitrogen in the soil[274]. It prefers neutral to alkaline soil conditions[238] and requires a warm sunny position if it is to do well[14]. Often grown in the herb garden and sometimes cultivated commercially as a medicinal herb[4, 61]. If the plant is cut back after flowering it will normally produce a second crop of leaves[238]. The fresh leaves have a pronounced musky smell, though this is lost once the plant is dried[245]. A good bee plant[1]. White horehound is a good companion plant for growing near tomatoes[24]. The tomatoes crop for a longer period and also produce a heavier crop[201]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].","Seed - sow April/May or August/September in a cold frame. Germination can be slow and erratic[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the following spring[K].

Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well.
