0,Agrostis capillaris,Browntop Bent Grass,Poaceae,3-10,None Known,"Grasslands and pastures. Dominant on poor and acidic soils and is well adapted to grazing pressure. Invades ruderal, disturbed areas, heathland, woodland, scrub and sand dune habitats. Abundant in wetlands and cultivated areas. In Australia, it is reported from dry coastal vegetation, heathy woodlands, lowland grasslands, grassy woodlands, dry and damp sclerophyll forests, riparian vegetation and alpine and sub-alpine vegetation, including montane peatlands and swamps [1-8].","Native to Eurasia, from Ireland and Britain in the west, through Siberia and Central Asia, as far east as China and from Scandinavia south to the Mediterranean, including Tunisia in North Africa.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.","A. alba var. vulgaris (With.) Coss. & Durieu. A. capillaris subsp. castellana (Boiss. & Reut.) O.Bol?s, Masalles & Vigo.

Environmental Uses: Amenity, Erosion control or dune stabilization, Landscape improvement, Revegetation, Soil conservation. Ornamental: garden plant, Seed trade [1-8]. Agronomically valuable fodder and pasture grass for livestock production, occasionally cut for hay. Used in garden lawn mixtures and in particular for tennis courts and golf course fairways. Widely grown in mild (cool-humid) summers, including some parts of Australia, northern Europe, the USA and New Zealand. Compared to A. stolonifera, A. capillaris has a more upright growth habit and does not spread aggressively. Used outside its native range for erosion control and in rehabilitation work.
