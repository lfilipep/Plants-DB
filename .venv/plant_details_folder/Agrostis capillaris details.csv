13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Agrostis capillaris is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Basic Starch: The Carbon Farming Solution. Eric Toensmeier.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
23,Other Uses Description,"Forest garden path mix [1-9]. Environmental Uses: Amenity, Erosion control or dune stabilization, Landscape improvement, Revegetation, Soil conservation. Ornamental: garden plant, Seed trade [1-8]. Agronomically valuable fodder and pasture grass for livestock production, occasionally cut for hay. Used in garden lawn mixtures and in particular for tennis courts and golf course fairways. Widely grown in mild (cool-humid) summers, including some parts of Australia, northern Europe, the USA and New Zealand. Compared to A. stolonifera, A. capillaris has a more upright growth habit and does not spread aggressively. Used outside its native range for erosion control and in rehabilitation work. A food source for herbivores, including rabbits [1-8]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A rhizomatous and stoloniferous  attractive, relatively short perennial grass. Ranging from 10 to 70 cm high. Soil drainage: free or impeded. Soil reaction: acid, alkaline, neutral. Dominant on poor and acidic soils. Soil texture: light or medium [1-8]. Found on a wide range of soils both damp and dry and from neutral to acidic. A hardy grass forming short grazed turf on poor soils on hills and mountains. Common and widespread in both lowland and upland pasture, meadows, heaths, open woodlands, road verges and banks. Upper elevation limit = 945m. Lower elevation limit = 0m."
