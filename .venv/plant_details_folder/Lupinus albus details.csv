0,Lupinus albus,White Lupin,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,Coming soon,"The seed of many lupin species contain bitter-tasting toxic alkaloids, though there are often sweet varieties within that species that are completely wholesome[65, 76]. Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65].","Disturbed ground on acid soils[45, 50].",S.

It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",L. sativus.

Used as a protein-rich vegetable or savoury dish in any of the ways that cooked beans are used, they can also be roasted or ground into a powder and mixed with cereal flours in making bread etc[183]. If the seed is bitter this is due to the presence of toxic alkaloids and the seed should be thoroughly leached by soaking it and then discarding the soak water before cooking[132]. Seeds contain 32 - 40% protein, 8 - 12% oil[160]. The roasted seeds can be used as a snack in much the same way as peanuts[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[4, 7]. The roasted seed is used as a coffee substitute[7, 61, 105, 183].","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

This is used in making soap[7]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making cloth etc[4]. A cosmetic face-mask can be made from lupin flour, this is used to invigorate tired skin[7]. A useful spring-sown green manure crop, especially on light soils. It is deep rooting, fairly fast growing, produces a good bulk and fixes atmospheric nitrogen[7, 46, 61, 87]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good soil. It prefers a light acid soil but tolerates adverse conditions[87]. Requires a sunny position[200]. The white lupin is sometimes cultivated, especially in S. Europe, for its edible seed[50] and also as a green manure crop[4]. There are some named varieties, many of which have bitter seeds that contain toxic alkaloids and require leaching before they are eaten but some sweet varieties have also been developed[183]. These sweet varieties are perfectly wholesome as food for humans and include the cultivar 'Kiev'[183]. There is some confusion between this species and L. nanus[1]. A deep rooting plant[87]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in mid spring in situ[1, 200]. You may need to protect the seed from mice. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
