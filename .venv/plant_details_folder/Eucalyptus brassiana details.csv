Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,None Known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"The wood is normally too valuable to be used as firewood. However, because it grows so quickly it could be used fuel as well as timber. It has a specific gravity of 0 40-0.80. Under plantation conditions common yields are 2040 m3 per ha per year. The wood is also good for heavy construction, furniture, and flooring. The roundwood is used for building poles and posts. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles). Eucalypts are top global timber and pulpwood crops - a few can be coppiced including Eucalyptus brassiana.  [1-1]. Other Systems: SRC.","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: SRCClimate: tropical. Humidity: humid. A hardy, fast growing tree adapted to the lowland tropics. The natural habitat of the species is tropical and humid to subhumid. It grows from 7 to 15 m high on infertile soils, and to more than 30 m high on fertile soils. Approximately half the trunk grows fairly strait. The other half is usually twisted and contorted, and splits into several branches.  The tree can withstand temperatures of at least 32 degrees centigrade, and grows up to 650m above sea level. It can tolerate a dry season of 3 to 5 months; minimum annual rainfall is 1,000 mm. Infertile soils are not considered a problem for the species. It grows on rocky slopes, inundated flats and depressions.  The trees prefers deep, moderately fertile, sandy loams. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: standard, coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seeds are first planted in a nursery, then transplanted after 6-10 weeks.
