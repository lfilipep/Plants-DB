Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antispasmodic  Aperient  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Laxative  TonicFumitory has been highly valued since at least Roman times for its tonic and blood cleansing effect upon the body[244]. It is particularly valuable in the treatment of all visceral obstructions, particularly those of the liver, in scorbutic affections and in troublesome eruptive diseases of the skin, especially eczema (for which it can be taken internally and externally)[4, 9, 238]. The herb is antispasmodic, aperient, cholagogue, slightly diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, laxative and weakly tonic[4, 9, 21, 165, 240]. The plant is harvested as flowering begins in the summer and can be used fresh or can be dried for later use[9, 238]. Some caution should be exercised in the use of this herb since excess doses cause hypnotic and sedative effects, especially if it is taken for more than about 8 days[238, 244].",
