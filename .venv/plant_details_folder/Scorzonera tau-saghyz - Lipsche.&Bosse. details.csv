It is cultivated in Russia for the latex in its root[61]. The plant accumulates more latex each year[110]. Plants are slow to establish and are usually harvested after 5 years growth[110].

Succeeds in any soil in sun or light shade[200].","Seed - sow spring in the greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into relatively deep pots to accommodate the tap root. If growth is good, plant out in early summer, other wise grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Division in autumn or as growth commences in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
