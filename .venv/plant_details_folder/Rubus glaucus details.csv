18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[196]. Rich, tart and very juicy, they are superior in flavour and quality to most cultivated blackberries and raspberries[196]. Similar to a loganberry in terms of taste and utility. The fruit is up to 3cm long[196].",

22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Because the plant has a resistance to cane-spot disease (Mycosphaerella rubi) and also has potential for improving the quality of other fruits, this species is crossed with Rubus cultivars in breeding programmes[317].This species could be useful in hybridization programmes with American and European blackberries and raspberries, but it is susceptible to some N. American raspberry diseases[196].A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Often cultivated in S. America for its edible fruit[196]. Yields of up to 20 tonnes per hectare are achieved in S. America[196]. This species could be useful in hybridization programmes with American and European blackberries and raspberries, but it is susceptible to some N. American raspberry diseases[196]. Closely related to R. occidentalis[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",
