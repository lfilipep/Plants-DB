13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Agastache foeniculum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"eaLeaves and flowers - raw or cooked. They are used as a flavouring in raw or cooked dishes[108, 177, 257]. Excellent raw, they have a sweet aniseed flavour and are one of our favourite flavourings in salads[K]. They make a delicious addition to the salad bowl[183] and can also be used to flavour cooked foods, especially acid fruits[K].The only drawback to the leaves is that they tend to have a drying effect in the mouth and so cannot be eaten in quantity[K]. A pleasant tasting tea is made from the leaves[46, 61, 161, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Diaphoretic  Pectoral  PoulticeThe leaves are cardiac and diaphoretic[222, 238, 257]. An infusion of the leaves is used in the treatment of colds, fevers, weak heart etc[222]. When left to go cold, the infusion is used to treat pains in the chest (such as when the lungs are sore from too much coughing)[207]. A poultice of leaves and stems can be used to treat burns[257]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position and a dry well-drained soil[187, 200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. The young growth in spring is very susceptible to slug damage[K]. The flowering plants are very attractive to bees and butterflies[K]. There is at least one named variety. 'Texas American' has an anise-pennyroyal fragrance and is used in a similar way to the species[183]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 13°c[133]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Division in spring. Fairly simple, if large divisions are used it is possible to plant them straight out into their permanent positions. Basal cuttings of young shoots in spring[111]. Harvest the young shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm tall and pot them up in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse. They should root within 3 weeks and can be planted out in the summer or following spring."
