See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",Many. See individual species.,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Parts of the plant are used for food and material but are toxic if untreated. The raw seed is toxic and requires treatment prior to eating it[46]. With Macrozamia communis (Burrawang) the sea kernals can be eaten after processing. Aged seeds have a distinctive flavor reminiscent of mild cheese - ground into flower for cakes. Leached kernals eaten raw, wrapped in paperbark and baked, or made into bread [183]. Macrozamia denisonii (Burrawang) stems are asource of edible starch [183]. Macrozamia miquelii - Seed - cooked[46]. The raw seed is toxic and needs to be treated to make it edible[46]. The Australian Aborigines would do this by several methods - one involved cooking the seed in ashes, another involved soaking the seeds in water for several days, then pounding them[46].The seeds were made fit to eat by a laborious process of cracking, soaking, grinding and baking[193]. Old, shrivelled seeds are said to be edible raw[193].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Genera to investigate include: Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Microcycas, and Zamia [1-1]. Nearly all cycads fix low amounts of nitrogen.

Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Industrial Crop: Starch: Materials and chemicals include bioplastics, paper, cardboard, solvents, paints, glues etc. Plants are usually pods, starchy fruits, nuts & seeds, starchy trunks.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height.

Humidity: arid to humid. Dioecious palmlike shrubs. Several species were important food sources for Australian Aborigines, after extensive processing to remove toxins. The more abundant species have also been recorded as livestock poisons. Most species have at some time gone under the common name of Burrawang. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: hypothetical.
