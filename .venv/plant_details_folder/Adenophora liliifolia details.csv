25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Woodland garden. Prefers a light rich slightly alkaline soil that is not too dry, and a warm sunny position[1, 200]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and should be planted out into their permanent positions when young[1]. This species has been cultivated for its edible root in Japan[46, 238]. The flowers have a sweet but refreshing perfume[245]. This is the only member of the genus with scented flowers[245]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, they have been known to destroy even mature plants[K].  Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. Surface sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot in the spring in order to avoid transplanting[133]. We have found that if transplanted when very small seedlings grow away without difficulty[K]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 10°c[133]. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst young. Basal cuttings in spring[K]. Division in spring - very difficult because the plant dislikes root disturbance[1]..
