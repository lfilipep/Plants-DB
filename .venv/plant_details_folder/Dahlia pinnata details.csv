24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant so long as the soil does not dry out[260]. It requires a deep rich soil and a sunny position[164], disliking shade[200]. The growing plant is very frost-tender, though the tubers are somewhat hardier tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[260]. However, these tubers are not reliably hardy if left in the ground over winter in Britain[200]. They are best harvested after the foliage is killed off by frost and then stored in a cool but frost-free place over the winter, planting out in April/May[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter to mid spring in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 weeks at 20°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of young shoots in early spring. The tubers are usually brought into the greenhouse in late winter in order to encourage early growth and young basal shoots are removed as soon as they are large enough[200]. Division. The roots are usually harvested in the autumn. These can be divided into individual tubers when planting out in the spring. Each portion should have a growing point[200]."
