24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows well in almost any fertile well-drained moderately retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. This species was formerly cultivated for its edible root[61]. All parts of the plant, especially the roots, are aromatic with a scent like melilot (Melilotus officinalis)[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer or the following spring[K]. Division in autumn[111]. Large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.
