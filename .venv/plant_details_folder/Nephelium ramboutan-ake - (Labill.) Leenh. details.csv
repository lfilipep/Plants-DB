13,Summary,"Pulasan or Nephelium ramboutan-ake is an ornamental fruit tree native to Peninsular Malaysia and a very closely related species to Rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum). It grows 10 - 15 m in height and up to 80 cm in bole diameter. It has alternate, pinnate leaves that are oblong and dark green. The fruit is sweeter but less juicy than rambutan. It is ovoid, dark red, fleshy, and with a thick and leathery rind similar to that of rambutan but has no hairy spines. The fruit is eaten raw or cooked then made into jams and compotes. The seed is ovoid, oblong, or ellipsoidal, and light brown. Unlike rambutan seeds, pulasan seeds are edible raw and has a flavor similar to that of almonds. The seed also yields oil which is used in lamps. The roots are used to treat fevers. The wood, on the other hand, is used in construction.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Nephelium ramboutan-ake is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

19,Edible Uses Description,"ruit - raw or cooked. The delicious white flesh of the fruit is less juicy than the rambutan (N. lappaceum), is sweeter and has a less sprightly taste[301 ]. Much eaten out of hand, it can also be used in jams and compotes[301 ]. The fruit ranges in size from 40 to 70 mm long and 40 to 60 mm in diameter[306 ]. The seed is roasted and used in the preparation of a cocoa-like beverage[301 ]. An oil is obtained from the seed[301 ]. Used in cooking[301 ].",

22,Other Uses,"Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Plant breeding: Used in producing new species of plants or improved varieties.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses An oil obtained from the seeds is used in lamps[418 ]. The wood is hard[418 ]. A useful timber, but rarely used because the fruit is too valuable to merit the tree being felled[418 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Pulasan grows best in the lowland humid tropics at an elevation below 600 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 32°c, but can tolerate 18 - 38°c[418 ]. The plant cannot tolerate frost. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,350 - 4,100mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position, tolerating some shade[418 ]. Prefers a sand or clay soil[303 ]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 5.8, tolerating 4.3 - 8[418 ]. There are some named varieties[301 , 306 ]. Some of the varieties bear parthenocarpic fruit[335 ]. Being overshadowed by good rambutan cultivars, this species has little prospect of being develop for commercial cultivation[306 ]. However, it is a good potential genetic source in breeding programmes with the rambutan[306 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a very short viability and so needs to be sown as soon as it is extracted from the fruit[303 ]. Wash the seed first to remove traces of the fruit[303 ]. When ripe, the seed germinates very quickly and grows rapidly[296 ]. Seedlings quickly produce a large root system and so need to be planted out into their permanent positions when still young[296 ]. The seed has a very short viability and needs to be sown as soon as possible after the fruit is harvested[296 ].",
