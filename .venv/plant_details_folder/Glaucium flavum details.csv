A very ornamental but short-lived perennial[1], it is hardy to about -10°c[187]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[200]. Flowers are produced in the first year from seed[200].","The seed can be sown in the middle of spring or in autumn in a cold frame. A period of cold stratification improves germination. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[1]. If you have sufficient seed it should be worthwhile trying an outdoor sowing in situ in mid spring[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
