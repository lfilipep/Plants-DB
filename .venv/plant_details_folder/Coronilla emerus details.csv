22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sunny position in most well-drained soils[184], preferring a moderately rich loamy soil[11, 182, 200]. An easily grown plant[11], it is hardy to about -20°c[184] if it is sheltered from cold winds[200]. Plants can be pruned almost back to the base if required, they usually resprout freely[200]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - scarify and then pre-soak the seed for 1 - 2 hours in warm water[164]. A period of cold stratification is also said to be helpful[200]. Sow the seed in spring in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place in 4 - 6 weeks at 15°c[164]. Pot up the seedlings as soon as possible into individual pots and plant them out in the following spring[164]. Cuttings of greenwood, June in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Cuttings of nearly mature side shoots, firm at the base and 7 - 10cm long with a heel, October/November in a frame. Plants are well rooted after 12 months. Good percentage[78]."
