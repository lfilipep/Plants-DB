See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Bambusa monogynia Griff.

Other Uses: The culms are used for temporary constructions (houses, bridges) and various household utensils such as water containers[310 , 361 ]. The culms are widely utilized for pulp to make paper[310 ]. Split culms are used for making baskets and mats[310 ]. Harvesting may start 3 - 4 years after a clump has begun to produce culms of maximum size. Only culms older than 3 years are harvestable and harvesting should never be done during the growing season. It is recommended to cut the culms lower than 30cm above the ground level, but not below the 2nd node. Debris and cut branches should always be removed completely[310 ]. The skin of the culms can be used for binding and caning of chairs[361 ].","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 29?c, but can tolerate 15 - 34?c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 3,600mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,500mm[418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in light shade[418 ]. Prefers a medium to heavy soil of at least moderate fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 6.5[418 ]. Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[K ]. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. The flowering cycle for this species is said to be 30 - 40 years[361 ].","Seed - many, if not all, members of this genus have a short viability and should be sown within 2 - 3 months of harvest. Sow in containers in a lightly shaded position and only just cover. Germination usually takes place readily. Prick out into individual pots as soon as the plants are large enough to handle. Plant out into permanent positions when 20cm tall. Plants may remain in their low-growing juvenile state for several years - cutting the culms to the ground level can stimulate taller adult growth[200 ]. Rhizome, culm and branch cuttings[310 ]. The propagules are raised in the nursery and after they have produced roots they are planted out in the field before or during the first half of the rainy season[310 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
