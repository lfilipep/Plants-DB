Requires a lime-free humus-rich soil[182]. One report says that it succeeds on a sheltered north wall[182] whilst another says that it needs a sunny position[219] and another says it needs warm summers[260]. Prefers a cool root run[182]. This species is not very cold-hardy in Britain, it is also slow growing[184]. It succeeds outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[184]. Plants do not flower well if the temperature drops below 5°c[200]. The Japanese form of this species might be hardier[11]. Plants grow taller in their native habitat, reaching a height of 3 metres[200]. The flowers emit a delicate sweet perfume[245]. Some named forms have been developed in Japan for their ornamental value[182]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a warm greenhouse in late winter or early spring[188]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in the spring[188]."
