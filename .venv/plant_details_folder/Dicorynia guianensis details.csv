The bole is straight and cylindrical which can be 150 cm in diameter. The tree is heavily buttressed. It is highly resistant to decays and moderately resistant to marine borers? damage making it ideal for marine constructions. The wood is also used as construction material and for bridge flooring, boat framing, carriage work, crossties, furniture, etc.","Dicorynia guianensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 35 m (114ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses: The heartwood is a russet colour when first cut, turning on exposure to a lustrous brown, often with a distinct reddish cast; it is sharply demarcated from the 2 - 10cm wide band of reddish sapwood. The texture is medium, the grain usually straight, with no distinctive odour or taste present in seasoned wood. In the green condition, angelique is similar to teak in most strength properties and clearly superior to white oak. It is about equal to the average for timbers of similar density in bending strength, elastic resilience, hardness, compression across the grain, shear, and toughness. It is above average in stiffness and in work to maximum load, slightly above average in crushing strength, but falls slightly below the average in tension across the grain and cleavage resistance. In the air-dry condition, angelique is superior to teak in all mechanical properties except tension perpendicular to the grain. It is superior to white oak in static-bending properties, compression parallel to the grain, and end hardness; comparable in shock resistance, side hardness, and compression across the grain; and inferior to white oak in shear, tension across the grain, and cleavage resistance. The working qualities vary according to the density and silica content but are generally rated as satisfactory. The wood finishes smoothly, splits easily, glues moderately well, and holds its place well under changes in atmospheric conditions. The wood is durable to very durable. The high resistance to decay and moderate resistance to damage by marine borers as well as its very good strength properties make angelique highly acceptable in marine construction for piling, poles, posts, and other similar uses where teredo are not a major factor. The wood is commonly used for construction purposes, bridge flooring, boat framing, carriage work, and crossties. To a limited extent, it, is also used for furniture, barrel staves, and parquet, strips and blocks. Because of small radial shrinkage, quartersawn material is considered suitable for flooring and for boat decks, frames, planking and millwork, general building construction, and agricultural implements[ 378 , 848 ].",,"In the wild the plant thrives best in deep, loamy, well-drained soils, but can also grow in wetter areas[ 378 ].",Seed.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
