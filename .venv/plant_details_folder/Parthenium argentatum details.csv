See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects, wind, Apomictic (reproduce by seeds formed without sexual fusion). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Latex: A source of rubber.,"A source of rubber obtained by mechanical maceration of the roots and/or stems.[61, 110, 171]. Yields of up to 240 kilos per hectare per year are possible (harvested when plants are 5 years old)[110].","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Coppice  Minor Global CropRequires a very well-drained soil in full sun[200]. Prefers a sandy soil but cultivated plants succeed on most soils except clay[110]. Established plants are very drought resistant[110]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, plants dislike winter temperatures falling below -10°c and suffer damage below -15°c[11]. In particular, they dislike fluctuating winter temperatures and excessive winter wet[110]. Plants grow well but give a poor yield of latex when growing in areas of higher rainfall[110]. (This refers to the very low levels of rain the plant experiences in its native habitat). More rubber is produced if the plant is prevented from flowering[110]. British summers are possibly not warm enough for this plant to thrive[110].","Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. Only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
