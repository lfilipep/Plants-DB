Unless there are specific entries with information on edible uses, it would be unwise to ingest any part of this plant[K ].(All parts of plant are poisonous if ingested )","Found in a wide variety of habitats; in disturbed forests; secondary growth; dunes; restingas; disturbed cerrado; rocky soils and roadsides at elevations from sea level to 1,100 metres[435 ].","S.

It can be found in South America particularly in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. It is not edible but is a popular medicinal plant utilized for treatments for digestive problems, liver problems, fevers, anemia, erysipelas, hepatitis, uterine tumors, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic gastritis, and others. The plant is grown by direct seed sowing.","Solanum paniculatum is a SHRUB growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,,None known,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Mouthwash: Treats problems such as mouth ulcers.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Cardiotonic  Carminative  Digestive  Febrifuge  Mouthwash  PoulticeThe plant is commonly used in Brazil, especially to treat digestive problems and a sluggish liver. Modern research has borne out these traditional uses. The plant contains a number of active compounds including steroids, saponins, glycosides, and alkaloids in the root, stem, and leaves. The alkaloids are found more abundantly in the root, although they are also present in the stem and leaves. The steroids and saponins are found in higher quantities in the root, while the leaves have the greatest amount of glycosides. The plant also has been found to contain a large proportion of bitter properties, which were thought to contribute to its ability to stimulate digestion[318 ]. Solanidine and solasodine were discovered in the leaves and fruit, which probably accounts for its liver-protective properties[318 ]. The compound solanin, also found in the plant, has been documented in clinical research to possess analgesic activity (possibly through its ability to block pain impulses in the nervous system)[318 ]. One study has shown that the root, stem, flower, leaf, and fruit of the plant have anti-ulcer activity[318 ]. The plant also has been documented to have cardiotonic activity, possibly due to the alkaloid solanidine, which has been documented to have this activity[318 ]. The leaves and roots are used as a tonic and for treating fevers, anaemia, erysipelas, hepatitis, liver and spleen disorders, uterine tumours, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic gastritis, and other such digestive problems as sluggish digestion, bloating, and flatulence. Jurubeba leaf tea is a very common household remedy throughout Brazil for hangovers, especially when combined with indigestion and bloating from overeating[318 ]. The plant is sometimes employed externally in poultices to heal wounds and ulcers[318 ].",,Other Uses: None known,,"Given its wide adaptability to various disturbed habitats and weedy nature, Solanum paniculatum would probably become naturalized in other parts of the world if introduced[435 ].
