0,Pittosporum resiniferum,Petroleum nut,Pittosporaceae,10-12,None known,"Not very abundant in any part of the Philippines, but it is widely distributed and usually found on high mountain ridges[345 ]. Found in mossy forests at elevations from 600 - 2,400 metres[360 , 418 ]. Found among other trees like oak and other mossy forest species. It can also grow well with pine trees.","Southeast Asia - Malaysia, Philippines.",(0 of 5),(4 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Pittosporum_resiniferum1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Pittosporum_resiniferum2.JPEG",Sometimes misspelt as Pittosporum resinosum,"Pittosporum resiniferum is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",This name is unresolved. Pittosporum resinosum (misspelt),,None Known,Leprosy: Used to treat leprosy - a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and superficial nerves (in the skin) caused by Mycobacterium leprae.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.LeprosyHerbalists in the Philippines use the petroleum nut as a universal medicine[360 ]. An infusion of the fruit is used as a remedy for intestinal and stomach pains[360 ]. An oleoresin obtained from the fruit is used externally as a cure for leprosy and other skin diseases; also to bring relief from muscular pains and skin diseases[360 , 418 ]. A decoction of the nuts is used in the treatment of colds[360 , 418 ]. The crushed nuts, combined with coconut oil, are used to bring relief from myalgia[360 ]. A decoction of the leaves is taken in the treatment of coughs[360 ]. The sap is used to treat ringworm[360 ].",,"An oil obtained from the fruit contains a dihydroterpene and also considerable quantities of normal heptane, which had only once before been found in nature, occurring in the digger pine (Pinus sabiniana) of California[345 ]. The oil can also be distilled into a very pure form of n-Heptane. Dihydroterpene is used in perfumes and medicines, whilst heptane is a component of gasoline, and has been suggested as a possible component of paint and varnish[269 ]. The oil is quite sticky, and in a thin layer rapidly becomes resinous[345 ]. In an open dish it burns strongly, with a sooty flame. It distils unchanged up to 165°, then with decomposition to give a resin oil. The oil distilling from100° to 165° is colourless, with an orange-like odour[345 ]. The essential oil is 8 - 10% of the total fruit weight and comprises 40% myrcene, 38% a-pinene, n-heptane and n-nonane are minor components[360 ]. The fruits, even green ones, burn brilliantly when ignited. Hence they are used like torch nuts or candlenuts for illumination in the bush[345 , 418 ]. The fruits are about 3cm long, borne in clusters on the stems[345 ]. The oil comes from the fruit, not the seed[360 ]. The nut has a carbon rating of 54, much higher than Jatropha curcas which has 41[360 ]. Carbon farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon.","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.","Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: StandardA plant of moderate to high elevations in the moist to wet tropics, where it can be found at elevations from 600 - 2,400 metres[303 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature is within the range 18 - 28°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil[418 ]. The tree can commence fruiting when 6 - 12 metres tall[345 ]. Tree can commence bearing fruit within five years from seed[360 ]. One tree yields an average 250 - 300 kilos of fruit per year[360 ]. One litre of high flammable oil can be obtained from 15 kilos of fresh fruits[345 , 360 ]. There are considerable differences in the proportion of heptane and dihydroterpene found in the oil; the season and degree of ripeness of the fruits undoubtedly playing a considerable role in this respect[345 ]. All parts of the tree are distinctly resiniferous and have the same pleasant, orange-like odour as the fruits[345 ]. The flowers are fragrant[345 ]. Climate: tropical highlands. Humidity: humid. Cultivation: experimental. Management: standard.",Seed - The seed probably has a very short viability of less than 1 month[418 ].
