14,Physical Characteristics,"Livistona australis is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,Leaves: 
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young unfolded leaves - raw or cooked[46, 61, 177]. The young and tender leaves are eaten like cabbages[2]. The young leaf buds are often used but, since the plants are unable to produce side-shoots, this effectively kills the plant[144, 154]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are used for thatching and making hats[61, 144]. They are large and fibrous and can also be used for making baskets, bags, nets etc[156]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Street tree. Requires a sheltered position in a fertile moist but well-drained soil that is preferably neutral to acid[188, 231]. Although plants prefer a deep moist soil, they can also succeed in dry climates[231]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. Plants naturally grow in forest habitats and, especially when young, require some shade from the sun for at least part of the day[231]. This species is not very hardy in Britain where it usually requires greenhouse protection[1]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Plants have been known to tolerate temperatures down to at least 0°c for short periods[200], they are also very amenable to pot cultivation and can be grown successfully in containers for many years[157]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. Plants are slow-growing[188]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in early spring in a warm greenhouse, using deep containers in order to avoid root constriction and plating two seeds in each container[200]. The seed of this species has a longer viability than that of most palms[200]. If necessary, thin the seedlings to the best plant and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least two years. If trying them outdoors, plant them out in the summer and give them some protection from the cold for their first few winters."
