Plants have proved to be fairly wind tolerant in an exposed site in Cornwall[K]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. Plants can be pruned back to the old wood in spring in order to maintain the shape of the plant and promote lots of new growth[238]. The whole plant smells of curry, especially after rain[238]. The flowering stems are often dried and used as 'everlasting flowers'[238]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5cm with a heel, June/July in a frame. Roots in 4 weeks. Good percentage[78].",
