13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Araucaria angustifolia is an evergreen Tree growing to 35 m (114ft) by 28 m (91ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.
19,Edible Uses Description,"d similar to large pine nuts[46 , 349 ]. A mealy texture and a somewhat sweet flavour, reminiscent of sweet potatoes[301 ]. The seeds are extensively harvested in southern Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina and the Rio Grande do Sul states), and are important for the region's small population of natives (the Kaingáng and other Southern Jê). The seeds, called pinhão are a popular winter snack. An edible gum is obtained from the tree[301 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The species is widely used in folk medicine.
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"A resin is obtained from the bark[349 ]. The heartwood is light yellow to brown, often with purplish-pink veins; it is not clearly demarcated from the yellowish sapwood. The texture is fine and uniform, without prominent alternating bands of early and latewood; the grain is straight; there is no distinctive odour. The wood is light in weight, soft, not very durable, being susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It can be slow to season, but with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood is easy to work with normal tools, though internal stresses in the wood may cause distortion in machining; nailing and screwing are good; glueing is correct. It is used for general building purposes, for framing lumber, interior trim, sash and door stock, flooring, furniture and veneer, as slats for Venetian blinds and also as backing for electrotypes[46 , 316 , 349 , 419 , 848 ]. It is also used for plywood, pulp and paper; and locally to make musical instruments, boxes and matches[349 ]. Useful as a fuel wood[338 , 349 ]. Grown as an ornamental plant in parks of towns and cities of Chile, from Santiago to Valdivia."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbFound in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics, which experience a mild to hot summer without a dry season[349 ]. The plant is found at elevations between 200 - 2,200 metres, but is only found below 500 metres where cool air flows from the highlands towards the valleys[418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 23c, but can tolerate 9 - 27c[418 ]. Mature plants can be killed by temperatures of -5c or lower, but new growth will be severely damaged at 0c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,250 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Prefers a medium-textured, moist but well-drained soil[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[418 ]. Optimum annual wood production is 10 - 23 cubic metres per hectare[418 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[419 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual containers[134 , 419 ]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 15c[134 ]. The plants have a rather sparse root system and are best placed in their final positions as soon as possible."
