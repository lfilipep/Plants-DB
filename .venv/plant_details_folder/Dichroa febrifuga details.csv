The flowers vary in colour according to the type of soil they grow in, the best blue colour is formed when plants are in very acid soils[260]. One report says that this plant is probably not hardy outdoors in Britain[11] whilst another says that some provenances tolerate temperatures down to about -5°c[260] and another report says that the forms in cultivation are only fully hardy in southern Cornwall[1].

24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring and only just covering it. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings. No details are given, we suggest trying in August with almost ripe wood in a frame."
