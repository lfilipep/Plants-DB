24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a lime-free peaty well-drained loam[200]. Prefers a deep cool root run in a sunny position[11]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, the plants usually require greenhouse protection but they could succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country if given protection from severe weather[1]. They tolerate frosts down to about -5°c if growing in a sheltered position in a well-drained soil[200] and can be grown in the rock garden or scree[200]. Rather slow growing[200]. Flowers are produced on the tips of the previous seasons growth. Plants may suffer from sudden die back[200]. Hermaphrodite and dioecious forms exist.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn if this is possible, otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Softwood cuttings 5cm long in late spring[200].",
