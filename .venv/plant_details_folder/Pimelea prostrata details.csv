Hermaphrodite and dioecious forms exist.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn if this is possible, otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors.

Softwood cuttings 5cm long in late spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
