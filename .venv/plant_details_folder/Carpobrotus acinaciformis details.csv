18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[1, 61, 89]. There is very little flesh in the fruit and it must be fully ripe otherwise it is very astringent[K]. Insipid[46, 105, 177]. Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 173]. Very mucilaginous, we find it very hard to enjoy them[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fire retardant: Plants that do not easily burn and can be used in barrier plantings to limit the spread of forest fires.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,Planted in maritime areas to prevent soil erosion in sandy soils and on steep banks[200]. Plants form a dense carpet and make an effective ground cover[208]. The plant is moderately fire-resistant and can be used in barrier plantings to prevent the spread of forest fires[200].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained sandy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Plants can be grown on dry walls or in the flower border[166]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Very resistant to wind and salt spray[166]. Moderately fire-retardant[200]. Plants are not very frost resistant and can be killed by temperatures below about -2°c. They have naturalized themselves on cliffs along the coast of S. Britain but do not succeed inland unless grown in a sunny sheltered position[200]. A vigorous prostrate plant, rooting as it spreads. The flowers only open in the afternoon[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow March to June in a greenhouse. Lower night-time temperatures are beneficial. The seed usually germinates in 7 - 10 days at 23°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings at any time during the growing season. Allow the cutting to dry in the sun for a day or two then pot up in a very sandy mix. Very easy[K].",
