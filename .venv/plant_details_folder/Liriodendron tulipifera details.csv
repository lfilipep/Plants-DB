25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep rich soil[11, 43, 200] and a sheltered but not overshadowed position[1]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[188]. Succeeds in sun or semi-shade[188]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is fast-growing and moderately long-lived in its native range[229]. Flowers are first produced when the tree is about 15 - 20 years old[229]. Liriodendron tulipifera is the state tree of both Indiana and Tennessee[270]. Intolerant of root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots and placed into their final positions as soon as possible. Any transplanting is best done in May[11]. Trees flower best in regions with long hot summers[200]. Plants are particularly susceptible to attacks by rabbits and hares[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady place in a cold frame[80, 113, 200]. Stored seed requires 3 weeks warm then 12 weeks cold stratification[80, 113]. Germination is usually poor, only about 1% of the seed is viable[80]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Layering in spring. Do not sever from the parent plant for 2 years[200].",
