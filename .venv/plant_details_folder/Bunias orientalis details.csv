Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Leaves and young stems - raw or cooked[17, 61, 105, 177, 183]. The young leaves have a mild cabbage flavour that goes very well in a mixed salad, though some people find them indigestible[K]. The leaves are a bit hairy so we find them less than wonderful when eaten raw on their own[K]. The cooked leaves make an excellent vegetable[K]. The leaves are available early in the year, usually towards the end of winter, and the plant will continue to produce leaves until late autumn, with a bit of a gap when the plant is in flower[27, K]. Flower buds and flowering stems - raw or cooked[264]. A pleasant mild flavour with a delicate sweetness and cabbage-like flavour, they make an excellent broccoli substitute though they are rather smaller[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Plants have also been seen growing exceedingly well in the dappled shade of a woodland garden[K]. Plants are quite tolerant of neglect, growing well amongst long grass on our Cornish trial ground[K]. The young spring growth can be quite badly damaged by slugs, though more mature plants grow away so quickly that this does not seem to be a problem[K]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].","Seed - sow April in a cold frame. Germination is usually very quick and good. Prick out the seedlings into pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. The seed can also be sown in situ in the spring, though the seedlings are rather prone to slug damage[K]. Division in spring. Quick and easy. Root cuttings 2 - 5cm in length succeed at any time during the growing season, though early spring as the plant comes into growth is best[K]. If the top 7 - 10cm of the plant is removed to supply root cuttings and divisions, the roots remaining in the soil usually regrow very quickly[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
