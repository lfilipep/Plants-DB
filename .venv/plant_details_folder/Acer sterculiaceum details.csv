See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. villosum.

Used mainly for fuel[158].",,"Of easy cultivation, it prefers a good moist well-drained soil[11[ in a sunny position, but tolerates some shade[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Chlorosis can sometimes develop as a result of iron deficiency when the plants are grown in alkaline soils, but in general maples are not fussy as to soil pH. This species is not very hardy in Britain and is unlikely to succeed outside the milder parts of the country. Forms from the W. Himalayas are likely to be the hardiest. Most maples are bad companion plants, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20].","Seed is seldom available for this species. when obtained, it is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the following spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours and then stratify for 2 - 4 months at 1 - 8°c. It can be slow to germinate. The seed can be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has dried and produced any germination inhibitors) and sown immediately. It should germinate in late winter. If the seed is harvested too soon it will produce very weak plants or no plants at all[80, 113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 20cm or more tall before planting them out in their permanent positions. Layering, which takes about 12 months, is successful with most species in this genus. This species, however, has brittle branches and so it can be difficult to find suitable branches to layer. Cuttings of young shoots in June or July. The cuttings should have 2 - 3 pairs of leaves, plus one pair of buds at the base. Remove a very thin slice of bark at the base of the cutting, rooting is improved if a rooting hormone is used. The rooted cuttings must show new growth during the summer before being potted up otherwise they are unlikely to survive the winter. Cuttings of this species are almost impossible to root. Grafting can be quite difficult because there are no suitable rootstocks in this section of the genus. Scions of A. pseudoplatanus can be used and are more or less successful.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
