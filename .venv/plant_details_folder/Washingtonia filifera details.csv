17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked or dried for later use[2, 46, 161, 177, 257]. It can be made into jellies and drinks or dried and ground into a meal[46, 183]. The seed can be ground up with the dried fruit and then both are eaten as a porridge[246]. The fruit is small and hard[213], but has a thin sweet pulp that tastes somewhat like dates[183, 213]. The ovoid fruit is about 6mm long and 4mm wide[200]. Young central bud - roasted[46, 177, 183]. Harvesting this central bud will kill the tree since it is unable to make side branches[K]. Young leaf bases - raw or cooked[161, 177]. Seed - cooked. It can be ground into a powder and used for making bread or porridge[161, 183]."

22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Musical: Specific mention of plants used as musical instruments. Does not include the various woods that can be used for making musical instruments.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre from the leaves is used in basket making and for cordage[46, 169]. The whole leaves are woven and used as the side walls and roofs of huts and temporary dwellings[46, 257]. The seeds have been used as the rattle in gourd rattles[257]. Wood - light and soft[82]. It has been used for making cooking implements, spoons etc[257]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Requires a sheltered sunny position in a fertile moist but well-drained soil[188, 231]. Tolerates some salt in the soil[200] and maritime exposure in climates that are warmer than Britain[200]. Plants can tolerate extensive droughts so long as their roots have tapped into underground water supplies[231]. Plants can tolerate light frosts and should succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of Britain[166]. They have been known to tolerate short-lived lows down to about -10°c[231]. This species has an extensive and fleshy but strong root system that can penetrate to a considerable depth in search of water[231]. It generally establishes best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. Plants growing in the wild are seen as an indication of underground water[200]. Plants produce a 'skirt' of old dead leaves, this can be a fire hazard and the old leaves are usually removed when being grown in areas liable to forest fires[200]. A fast growing tree, even when young, in its native environment and very tolerant of transplanting despite its deep root system[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking for 24 hours in warm water may speed up germination, especially of stored seed[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first two winters outdoors."
