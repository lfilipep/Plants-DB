0,Ledum palustre,"Wild Rosemary, Marsh Labrador tea",Ericaceae,Coming soon,Plants contain a narcotic toxin called Ledel. This toxin only causes problems if the leaves are cooked for a long period in a closed container[172].,Possibly native to Britain in acid bogs near Bridge of Allan in Sterling and Perth. A rare escape elsewhere in Britain[17].,"Northern Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to Germany amd Japan.",(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LedumPalustre.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LedumPalustre2.jpg",,"Ledum palustre is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Bog Garden;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","eaA tea is made from the aromatic leaves[172, 183]. Considered by some to be a better tea than that made from L. groenlandicum[183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. It would be better to brew the tea in cold water by leaving it in a sunny place, or to make sure that it is brewed for a short time only in an open container. The leaves are used as a flavouring, they are a bayleaf substitute[172]. The plant has been used as a hop substitute in making beer, though this has caused an unpleasant kind of drunkenness which is accompanied by a headache and dizziness[232].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Homeopathy  Laxative  Narcotic  StomachicThe leaves and young flowering shoots are astringent, diaphoretic, disinfectant, diuretic, laxative, pectoral, stomachic and tonic[4, 172, 222, 257]. The plant is more strongly narcotic than L. groenlandicum[4] and should not be used without expert supervision[9]. A tea is taken internally in the treatment of asthma, coughs, colds, stomach aches, kidney ailments etc[4, 222, 257]. Externally, it is used as a wash for burns, ulcers, stings, infections etc[222, 257]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the whole, dried and powdered, plant[232]. This is used in the treatment of stings, injuries and joint pains[232]. It is also used in the treatment of various chest complaint, asthma, menstrual pain etc[9].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","The leaves are hung up in the clothes cupboard in order to repel insects[4, 172]. The branches are also placed among grain in order to keep mice away[4, 172]. A strong decoction of the leaves is used to kill lice and insects[4, 232]. The leaves contain tannin[4].",,"Requires a lime-free loam or peaty soil[1, 11]. Prefers a moist humus-rich acid soil in shade or semi-shade[200]. Plants flower more freely when grown in a sunny position. Plants grow better if they have certain fungal associations in the soil. The best way of providing this is to incorporate some soil from around well-growing established plants into the soil for the new plant[200]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The leaves are very aromatic[182]. When crushed, they smell strongly of hops[232]. Plants benefit from removing the dead flowers before they set seed[188]. This prevents them putting too much energy into seed production at the expense of more flowers and leaves. A good bee plant[4]. The flowers contain an oil that smells strongly of antiseptic[232].","Seed - surface sow in a shady part of the greenhouse in February or March[78, 113]. Another report says that the seed is best sown in the autumn as soon as it is ripe[188]. Germination is variable and can be quite slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the pots on in a shady frame for 18 months before planting them out into their permanent positions[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. Fair percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, November/December in a frame[113]. Layering in the autumn. Takes 12 months[78]. Division.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
