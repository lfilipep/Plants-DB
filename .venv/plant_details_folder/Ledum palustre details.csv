19,Edible Uses Description,"eaA tea is made from the aromatic leaves[172, 183]. Considered by some to be a better tea than that made from L. groenlandicum[183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. It would be better to brew the tea in cold water by leaving it in a sunny place, or to make sure that it is brewed for a short time only in an open container. The leaves are used as a flavouring, they are a bayleaf substitute[172]. The plant has been used as a hop substitute in making beer, though this has caused an unpleasant kind of drunkenness which is accompanied by a headache and dizziness[232]."

A tea is taken internally in the treatment of asthma, coughs, colds, stomach aches, kidney ailments etc[4, 222, 257]. Externally, it is used as a wash for burns, ulcers, stings, infections etc[222, 257]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the whole, dried and powdered, plant[232]. This is used in the treatment of stings, injuries and joint pains[232]. It is also used in the treatment of various chest complaint, asthma, menstrual pain etc[9]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free loam or peaty soil[1, 11]. Prefers a moist humus-rich acid soil in shade or semi-shade[200]. Plants flower more freely when grown in a sunny position. Plants grow better if they have certain fungal associations in the soil. The best way of providing this is to incorporate some soil from around well-growing established plants into the soil for the new plant[200]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The leaves are very aromatic[182]. When crushed, they smell strongly of hops[232]. Plants benefit from removing the dead flowers before they set seed[188]. This prevents them putting too much energy into seed production at the expense of more flowers and leaves. A good bee plant[4]. The flowers contain an oil that smells strongly of antiseptic[232]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a shady part of the greenhouse in February or March[78, 113]. Another report says that the seed is best sown in the autumn as soon as it is ripe[188]. Germination is variable and can be quite slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the pots on in a shady frame for 18 months before planting them out into their permanent positions[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. Fair percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, November/December in a frame[113]. Layering in the autumn. Takes 12 months[78]. Division."
