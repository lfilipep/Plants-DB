4,Known Hazards,"Although no mention of toxicity has been seen for this species, it does contain saponins. Although toxic, these substances are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm. They are also broken down by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Silene dioica is a BIENNIAL/PERENNIAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from June to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",

20,Other Uses,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,
21,Other Uses Description,"The root is used as a soap substitute for washing clothes etc[46, 61]. The soap is obtained by simmering the root in hot water.",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained nitrogen-rich soil in light shade[17, 200]. Succeeds in any position that is not hot and dry[187]. Hardy to about -25°c[187]. Hybridizes readily with S. latifolia[17]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[187]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown outdoors in situ during the spring. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",
