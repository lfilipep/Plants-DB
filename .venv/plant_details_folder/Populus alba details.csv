13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Populus alba is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in March. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,Leaves: 
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.
19,Edible Uses Description,"ich in Vitamin C[179]. Inner bark - dried, ground into a powder and added to flour for making bread[2, 105]. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails[177]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Antiseptic  Astringent  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Tonic  Urinary  Vitamin CThe stem bark is anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, astringent, diuretic and tonic[14, 46, 61, 178, 218]. The bark contains salicylates, from which the proprietary medicine aspirin is derived[238]. It is used internally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, gout, lower back pains, urinary complaints, digestive and liver disorders, debility, anorexia, also to reduce fevers and relieve the pain of menstrual cramps[14, 46, 61, 178, 213, 238]. Externally, the bark is used to treat chilblains, haemorrhoids, infected wounds and sprains[238]. The bark is harvested from side branches or coppiced trees and dried for later use[238]. The leaves are used in the treatment of caries of teeth and bones[218]. The twigs are depurative[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Rooting hormone: Substances that can be used to promote the production of roots in plant cuttings.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"An extract of the shoots can be used as a rooting hormone for all types of cuttings. It is extracted by soaking the chopped up shoots in cold water for a day[172]. A fairly wind resistant tree, it can be grown as part of a shelterbelt planting[200]. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark[100].  - rather woolly in texture, without smell or taste, of low flammability, not durable, very resistant to abrasion, very light, soft, elastic. It is used for less good quality purposes such as making matches, packing materials etc[11, 13, 46, 61, 100, 115]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it does well in a heavy cold damp soil[1]. Prefers a deep rich well-drained circumneutral soil, growing best in the south and east of Britain[11, 200]. Growth is much less on wet soils, on poor acid soils and on thin dry soils[11]. This species thrives on drier soils than other members of the genus[188]. It does not do well in exposed upland sites[11] but it is tolerant of maritime exposure, though it can be wind pruned in such a situation[11, 200]. Dislikes shade, it is intolerant of root or branch competition[200]. Tolerates both hot and cool summers[200]. A very ornamental tree, it is fast-growing but fairly short-lived[1, 11, 227]. There are several named varieties[188]. An important food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies[30]. The leaf buds are resinous and exude an aromatic perfume in the spring[245]. Poplars have very extensive and aggressive root systems that can invade and damage drainage systems. Especially when grown on clay soils, they should not be planted within 12 metres of buildings since the root system can damage the building's foundations by drying out the soil[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be sown as soon as it is ripe in spring[113]. Poplar seed has an extremely short period of viability and needs to be sown within a few days of ripening[200]. Surface sow or just lightly cover the seed in trays in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame. If sufficient growth is made, it might be possible to plant them out in late summer into their permanent positions, otherwise keep them in the cold frame until the following late spring and then plant them out. This species does not often produce viable seed in Britain[11]. Most poplar species hybridize freely with each other, so the seed may not come true unless it is collected from the wild in areas with no other poplar species growing[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 20 - 40cm long, November/December in a sheltered outdoor bed or direct into their permanent positions. Very easy. Suckers in early spring[78]."
