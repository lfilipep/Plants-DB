With its edible fruit it could very well be useful in a mixed planting to restore native woodland or to establish a woodland garden[K ]. The large trees of this species are grown in association with avocados. This combination works well because both species have the same soil requirements, and zapote provides necessary shade for the avocados[355 ]. Other Uses The wood is coarse-textured, irregular-grained, light in weight, with a low resistance to wood-eating organisms[625 ]. It is easy to cut, but has poor mechanical properties. It is used as core material for doors and panelling, and to make light boxes[625 ]."
