The leaves and young plants are cooked and have a salty flavour. The seed is prepared and used in piñole, an ancient grain originating with the Aztecs, or ground into a meal and used as a thickener in making bread. Other Atriplex species are recommended for human consumption, and Atriplex truncata as a fodder crop. Leaves are available all year.","Atriplex truncata is a ANNUAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 0.9 m (3ft in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously.
