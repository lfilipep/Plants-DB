13,Summary,"Wedgeleaf saltbush or saltweed is an annual herb native to California, growing to 0.9m in cold to warm temperate climates. The leaves and young plants are cooked and have a salty flavour. The seed is prepared and used in piñole, an ancient grain originating with the Aztecs, or ground into a meal and used as a thickener in making bread. Other Atriplex species are recommended for human consumption, and Atriplex truncata as a fodder crop. Leaves are available all year."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Atriplex truncata is a ANNUAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 0.9 m (3ft in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
23,Other Uses Description,A good fodder crop.
24,Cultivation Details,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Bank  Management: Coppice  Management: Fodder  Regional CropWe have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though it should be possible to grow it as a spring-sown annual. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in full sun in any well-drained but not too fertile soil[200]. Most species in this genus tolerate saline and very alkaline soils[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow April/May in situ[134]. Germination is usually rapid.
