13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Abies religiosa is an evergreen Tree growing to 40 m (131ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

21,Other Uses Description,"An oleo-resin is obtained from the tree (probably from the trunk)[46, 61]. It is balsamic and is used in medicines and in paints[46, 181].  - light, soft, not very durable. Used for pulp, construction, furniture etc[46, 181].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good moist but not water-logged soil[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very shade tolerant, especially when young, but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. Requires a sheltered position, trees are susceptible to wind damage[11]. Trees are tender in most parts of Britain[1, 11], they tolerate temperatures down to about -5 to -10°c[200]. There are trees in Kent and Hampshire that are 12 metres tall[11]. Grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and other areas with cool wet summers[11]. Growth from young trees has proved to be very vigorous in Britain, 60cm in its first year has been recorded and 70 cm in its third year from seed[185]. New growth takes place mainly between July and October[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].",
