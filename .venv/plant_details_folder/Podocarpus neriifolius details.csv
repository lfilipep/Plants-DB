The leaves taper to the tip and are oval in shape. Leaf decoction is used as remedy for rheumatism and arthritis. Fruit is eaten raw. The wood is of high quality and used for general carpentry, boat making, furniture, musical instruments, and many more. Plants can be grown from seeds, layers, or cuttings. Germination rate is slow and can take up to a year or more.","Podocarpus neriifolius is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

It is fine and even-textured; close and straight-grained, lustrous. The wood is light in weight, fairly hard, not very durable when exposed but resistant to termites and insects. It is easy to saw, but softer boards show a tendency to crumble on end grain; it can be planed, shaped, turned, mortized, and sanded with good results and to a smooth finish; the results of boring are sometimes rated as moderate; generally the wood holds nails well, but large nails may cause some splitting; gluing, staining, varnishing and painting properties are stisfactory.

It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,700mm with a uniformly distributed summer rain and up to 5 months of dry season. Optimal temperature range is 25 - 30°c with the coldest months having only between 8 - 24°c[404 ]. Prefers a position in full sun or bright shade[307 ]. Plants are shade tolerant, at least when young[200 , 404 ]. Succeeds in a range of soils, preferring fertile, slightly acid conditions[307 , 451 ]. Most species in this genus are tolerant of hard pruning, being able to regrow from old wood[200 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required.","Seed - generally slow to germinate, taking one year or more[200 ]. Seeds that have passed through the gut of an animal germinate faster[200 ]. Seeds have been known to germinate in the dense shade of a woodland[404 ]. Cuttings should include an erect lead shoot if a good form is required[200 ]. If side shoots are used, the resulting plant will be prostrate[200 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
