26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe. The seed has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow in a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. Germination should take place within 2 - 4 weeks. Young seedlings grow quickly[ 420 ]."
