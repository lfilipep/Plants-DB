19,Edible Uses Description,"s, Leaves, Oil, Stem, Vegetable. Leaves and leaf stems - raw or cooked[ 22 , 33 , 46 , 52 , 61 ]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[ 206 ]. The leaves can also be finely shredded and added to mixed salads[ 206 ]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[ 183 ]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[ 52 ]. Sweet and succulent[ 133 ]. The stem is trimmed then washed, halved, withered slightly and preserved with salt, cayenne pepper and zanthoxylum pericarps under pressure then marketed. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[ 1 , 2 , 17 , 57 , 183 ]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[ 74 ]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[ 171 ]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[ 183 ], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[ 238 ]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[ 238 ]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[ 238 ]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[ 238 ]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads. Plants produce swellings on the stem, these can be cooked or pickled[ 206 ]."

This is attributed to chemicals that are given off as the plants decay[ 206 ]. Other Uses None known
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Originating from the central Asian Himalayas to China, the plant has long been cultivated and many forms have been developed that can be grown from the temperate to the tropical zones. Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[ 16 , 200 , 206 ]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[ 16 ]. Dislikes very hot weather[ 33 ]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[ 206 ]. A form of B. Juncea that has been selected in the Orient for its edible swollen stem, there are many named varieties[ 206 ]. Plants are reasonably cold-tolerant[ 206 ]. They prefer a fairly high stable temperature and are well adapted to short day length[ 200 ]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[ 269 ]. A good bee plant[ 74 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ from August to October. Spring and early summer-sown crops tend to run quickly to seed, though they can be eaten whilst still small[ 206 ]. It is best not to sow the seed in very hot weather[ 206 ]. There are about 5,660 - 6,000 per 0.01 kg (1/3 oz)[ 269 ]."
