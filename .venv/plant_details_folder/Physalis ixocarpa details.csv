18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 38, 61]. The fruit is a berry that is 2.5cm or more in diameter[200]. When not fully ripe, the fruit can be cooked and used in curries, sauces, soups, stews etc[183]. A delicious flavouring when used like a tomato and added to soups, stews etc[K]. The fully ripe fruit is sweeter and can be eaten out of hand, added to salads or used in pies, preserves etc[183]. The plant conveniently wraps up each fruit in its own 'paper bag' (botanically, the calyx) to protect it from pests and the elements. This calyx is toxic and should not be eaten. The fruit can be stored for up to a year if picked before they are fully ripe and left inside their calyx.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Prefers a rich light soil[33, 38]. Tolerates hot dry weather[160]. One report suggests that the plant is a perennial but, if this is true, it is not winter hardy in Britain though it can be cultivated as an annual for its edible fruit in much the same way that tomatoes are grown[34]. There are some named varieties[183]. Some botanists unite this species with P. philadelphica[50], saying that it arose from P. philadelphica through cultivation. A slow growing plant[160]. Insect resistant[160].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170].,
