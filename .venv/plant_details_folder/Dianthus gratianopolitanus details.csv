22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a dry calcareous soil and a sunny position[111]. Dislikes shade[208]. Plants succeed when grown on the top of a broad or retaining wall[219]. Plants grow well in a maritime environment, though they dislike damp conditions. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. A very ornamental plant[1]. The flowers are strongly clove-scented and are very attractive to butterflies and moths[17]. The double-flowered form, 'Flore Plena' has an even stronger scent."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[111]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in July/August in a cold frame. Very high percentage[K]. Division in March[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
