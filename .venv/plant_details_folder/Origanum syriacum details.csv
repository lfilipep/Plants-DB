See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","The leaves and flowering tops are used as a seasoning, having a flavour reminiscent of a blend of thyme, marjoram and oregano[183]. The dried herb is sometimes mixed with sumac (from Rhus species) to form the spice blend known as 'zatar', this is used along with olive oil as a topping for breads[183]. The Bedouin grind the dried leaves, add salt and eat the dry mixture on bread[177, 183]. The leaves and flowering stems of this species are often dried and supplied commercially as 'oregano', a name that should more accurately be restricted to O. vulgare[238].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Prefers slightly alkaline conditions[1]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - sow in a greenhouse in early spring at 10 - 13°c and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in March or October. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings of young barren shoots in June. Very easy. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
