It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Larix europaea. Larix communis. Abies larix.

A sweet-tasting manna is obtained from the trunk, it can be eaten raw but is mainly used medicinally[2, 7, 46, 61, 105]. Another report says that 'Briancon manna' is exuded from the leaves in the summer[4]. It is white, sweet and almost odourless[4].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bach: Plants used in the Bach flower remedies.,Balsamic: A healing and soothing agent.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antidote  Antirheumatic  Antiseptic  Astringent  Bach  Balsamic  Diuretic  Eczema  Expectorant  Haemostatic  Laxative  Rubefacient  Stimulant  Vermifuge  VulneraryThe bark, stripped of its outer layer, is astringent, balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant and vulnerary[4, 21]. Its main application is as an expectorant in chronic bronchitis and has also been given internally in the treatment of haemorrhage and cystitis[4, 238]. A cold extract of the bark is used as a laxative[9]. As an external application, it is useful in the treatment of chronic eczema and psoriasis[4]. The powdered bark can be used on purulent and difficult wounds to promote their healing[21]. The bark is harvested in the spring and should be dried rapidly[4]. The turpentine obtained from the resin is antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, haemostatic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4, 238]. It is a valuable remedy in the treatment of kidney, bladder and rheumatic affections, and also in diseases of the mucous membranes and the treatment of respiratory complaints[4]. Other reports say that it is contraindicated for anyone with a kidney complaint[7, 238]. Externally, the turpentine is used in the form of liniment plasters and inhalers[4]. It has also been suggested for combating poisoning by cyanide or opium[4]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Lack of confidence', 'Anticipation of failure' and 'Despondency'[209]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Larix decidua for fevers & colds, coughs/bronchitis, tendency to infection, blood pressure problems, inflammation of mouth and pharynx, common cold (see [302] for critics of commission E).","Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Large quantities of resin are obtained by tapping the trunk[4]. Small holes are bored into the trunk, most resin being obtained from near the centre of the trunk[171]. When properly made, the same borehole can be used for 20 - 30 years[64]. The resin has a wide range of uses including wood preservatives, varnish, medicinal etc[4, 64]. It needs no preparation other than straining through a cloth to remove plant debris etc[4]. The hole is made in the spring and the resin extracted in the autumn[64].  can be extracted from May to October[4]. The yield is about 40 grams per tree[64]. A fast-growing tree that establishes itself rapidly and is also said to improve the quality of the soil, the larch can be used as a pioneer species on cleared and exposed land in order to assist the establishment of other woodland trees[4]. The bark contains tannin[171]. This is much utilized in N. Europe[223], though in Britain the oak is considered to be a better source[4]. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 11.6% tannin[223].  - durable, tough, elastic, easy to split, takes a good polish[4, 46, 61, 81]. Larch produces one of the toughest woods obtained from conifers and is also resistant to woodworm[4]. It is widely used in construction, for railway sleepers, cabinet work etc[4, 46, 61, 81].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Prefers an open airy position in a light or gravelly well-drained soil[11, 200]. It tolerates acid and infertile soils, though it dislikes very peaty or very chalky soils[11]. Another report says that it tolerates chalky soils[200]. Succeeds on rocky hill or mountain sides and slopes[200]. Tolerates salt-laden gales according to one report[75] whilst another says that it dislikes exposed positions[11]. The larch dislikes atmospheric pollution and so does not grow well in towns[185]. A north or east aspect is more suitable than west or south[11]. It dislikes growing in wet ground or frost pockets[11, 81], and grows best in areas with abundant rainfall[11]. The larch is a very ornamental tree that is widely grown for forestry[11, 81]. It is very fast growing with new annual growth of 1.5 metres often found and trees can average 60cm or more for many years[185]. The dormant trees are very cold hardy, but they are often excited into premature growth in Britain by mild spells during the winter, the plants are then subject to damage by late frosts and cold winds[1, 185]. The young shoots have a delicate mossy fragrance as the leaves unfold[245]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Open ground plants, 1 year x 1 year are the best for planting out, do not use container grown plants with spiralled roots[200]. Plants transplant well, even when coming into growth in the spring[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[81, 200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow late winter in pots in a cold frame. One months cold stratification helps germination[113]. It is best to give the seedlings light shade for the first year[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots. Although only a few centimetres tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer providing you give them an effective weed-excluding mulch and preferably some winter protection for their first year. Otherwise grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year. The seed remains viable for 3 years[113] If you are growing larger quantities of plants, you can sow the seed in an outdoor seedbed in late winter. Grow on the seedlings in the seedbed for a couple of years until they are ready to go into their permanent positions then plant them out during the winter.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
