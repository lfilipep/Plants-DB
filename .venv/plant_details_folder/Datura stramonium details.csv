Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Anthelmintic  Antiasthmatic  Antidandruff  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Hallucinogenic  Hypnotic  Mydriatic  NarcoticThe thornapple is a bitter narcotic plant that relieves pain and encourages healing[238]. It has a long history of use as a herbal medicine, though it is very poisonous and should be used with extreme caution. The leaves, flowering tops and seeds are anodyne, antiasthmatic, antispasmodic, hallucinogenic, hypnotic, mydriatic and narcotic[1, 4, 7, 9, 13, 21, 46, 165, 238, 240]. The seeds are the most active medicinally[4]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of asthma and Parkinson's disease, excess causes giddiness, dry mouth, hallucinations and coma[238]. Externally, it is used as a poultice or wash in the treatment of fistulas, abscesses wounds and severe neuralgia[238, 257]. The use of this plant is subject to legal restrictions in some countries[238]. It should be used with extreme caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner since all parts of the plant are very poisonous and the difference between a medicinal dose and a toxic dose is very small[21, 213, 238]. The leaves should be harvested when the plant is in full flower, they are then dried for later use[4]. The leaves can be used as a very powerful mind-altering drug, they contain hyoscyamine and atropine[213]. There are also traces of scopolamine, a potent cholinergic-blocking hallucinogen, which has been used to calm schizoid patients[213]. Atropine dilates the pupils and is used in eye surgery[222]. The leaves have been smoked as an antispasmodic in the treatment for asthma, though this practice is extremely dangerous[213, 222]. The seeds are used in Tibetan medicine, they are said to have a bitter and acrid taste with a cooling and very poisonous potency[241]. Analgesic, anthelmintic and anti-inflammatory, they are used in the treatment of stomach and intestinal pain due to worm infestation, toothache and fever from inflammations[241]. The juice of the fruit is applied to the scalp to treat dandruff[243]."
20,Other Uses,"Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
21,Other Uses Description,"The growing plant is said to protect neighbouring plants from insects[18, 20]. The juice of the fruits is applied to the scalp to cure dandruff and falling hair[243]. There has also been considerable interest in the use of extracts of Datura species as botanical pesticides. D. metel, for example, appears to suppress a number of nematode species of economic importance. Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Foundation, Specimen."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Foundation, Specimen. Succeeds in most moderately good soils but prefers a rich light sandy soil or a calcareous loam, and an open sunny position[1, 4, 200]. Plants often self-sow when well sited[1]. The thornapple is cultivated commercially as a medicinal plant[57]. It can become a weed in suitable conditions and is subject to statutory control in some countries[238]. This species is extremely susceptible to the various viruses that afflict the potato family (Solanaceae), it can act as a centre of infection so should not be grown near potatoes or tomatoes[200]. Grows well with pumpkins[20]. The whole plant gives off a nauseating stench[245]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Sow the seed in individual pots in early spring in a greenhouse[200]. Put 3 or 4 seeds in each pot and thin if necessary to the best plant. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 6 weeks at 15°c. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Especially in areas with hot summers, it is worthwhile trying a sowing outdoors in situ in mid to late spring."
