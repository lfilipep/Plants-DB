18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105, 146, 158, 200, 218]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Astringent  Dysentery  TonicAnodyne, astringent, tonic[178]. The wood is anodyne and a uterosedative[218]. The stem bark is used in the treatment of dysentery[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"- hard, close grained, warps badly[158]. It makes a good charcoal[146, 158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. A very ornamental tree[1]. There is some confusion between this species and C. controversa[11]. Plants usually fruit heavily in Britain[11]. The flowers have a soft sweet perfume[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame[188]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78]."
