18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Root - cooked[177]. A good source of starch but the root has a bitter taste. This bitterness can be removed by freeze-drying the tubers to make a food called 'chuño'[196].

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Dislikes wet or heavy clay soils[16, 37]. Prefers a slightly acid soil, the tubers are subject to scab on limy soils or those deficient in humus. Yields best on a fertile soil rich in organic matter. This plant is one of the S. American species of potatoes. This is one of the most frost hardy of potato species and grows in areas that can experience frosts on 300 days of the year[196]. It can probably be grown in much the same way as potatoes are grown by planting out the tubers in spring and harvesting in the autumn[K]. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers in the Andes, mainly as insurance against cold weather[196]. Yields are quite low[196].Plants might have strict daylength requirements and may yield poorly in temperate zones because they need short-days in order to induce tuber-formation[196]. A pentaploid species, it produces fertile seed[196]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into a fairly rich compost as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on fast. Plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division. Harvest the tubers in autumn after the top-growth has been cut back by frost. Store the tubers in a cool frost-free place overwinter and replant in April.
