23,Other Uses Description,"The inner bark is long and stiingy like that of the Lime-tree (Tilia spp.)[492 ]. The inner bark of the lime is a source of fibre - is this bark used similarly?[K ]. The heartwood is a reddish or greyish-brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the 4cm wide band of light brown sapwood. The grain is fine and dense, the wood cold and smooth to the touch with a peculiar smell when worked, but no discernible taste when seasoned. It is heavy; hard, becoming harder with age; exceedingly strong and hard to break transversely; durable to very durable. There are differing reports on its ability to resist the attacks of toredo and barnacles[492 ]. It is widely recognized for its high resistance to marine borers[960 ]. The wood is very hard to saw and plane; it is fissile, taking nails badly; it turns and polishes indifferently, except in the best qualities; it cleaves straight. The wood is not very ornamental, but can be used for house-framing, wharves and sluices[492 ].",
