See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower in September, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",C. atlantica.

The oil is also astringent, diuretic, expectorant and sedative[254]. Diluted with a carrier oil such as almond, and massaged into the skin it is used in the treatment of skin diseases, ulcers, chest infections, catarrh, cystitis and dandruff[4, 238, 254]. It is used as an inhalant for treating bronchitis, tuberculosis and nervous tension[4, 238]. An infusion of the branches can also be used[238].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","An essential oil obtained from the distilled branches is used in perfumery, notably in jasmine-scented soaps[238]. The essential oil also repels insects[238]. Plants can be grown as a tall hedge[29].  - fragrant and durable[238]. It is prized for joinery and veneer and is also used in construction[61, 238]. It is also used for making insect-repellent articles for storing textiles[238].",,"Thrives on most soils, being very tolerant of chalk, dry sites and of drought when it is established[11, 81, 200]. Prefers a rich loam or a sandy clay in full sun[1]. This species is more tolerant of atmospheric pollution than other members of the genus[11]. Succeeds in warm dry areas with less than 40cm of rain a year, but also in areas with cool summers and up to 200cm of rain[200]. Small trees less than 50cm tall establish much quicker and better than taller trees, those more than 2 metres tall are difficult to establish[200]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Trees grow fairly rapidly, with height gains of 60cm in a year recorded[185]. This species is cultivated for its timber in some parts of S. Europe[50]. Small male cones are formed on the lower branches of trees, whilst the larger female cones are formed on higher branches[238]. These female cones persist on the tree for 2 - 3 years before breaking up[238]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - collect the cones in winter and keep in a warm room until they open[1]. Sow immediately in a cold frame[78]. One report says that a short cold stratification of one month improves germination rates[113]. Keep the seed pot moist, but be careful because the young seedlings are very prone to damp off, keep them well ventilated[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings of terminal shoots can be tried in a frame in November but they are very difficult[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
