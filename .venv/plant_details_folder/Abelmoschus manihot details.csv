19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves - raw or cooked[183 , 200 ]. Sweet and mucilaginous[183 , 300 ]. The leaves are high in vitamins A and C, and iron, and have 2% protein by dry weight. Young leaves can be used as a lettuce substitute[298 ] or a spinach substitute. Young shoots are harvested when about 15cm long[300 ]. Flower buds - raw or cooked[183 ]. There is a wide range of other leaf shapes."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Emmenagogue  Odontalgic  VulneraryThe bark is said to be emmenagogue[240]. A paste of the bark is used to treat wounds and cuts, with new paste being applied every 2 - 3 days for about 3 weeks[272]. In Nepal the root juice is warmed and applied to sprains[272]. The juice of the flowers is used to treat chronic bronchitis and toothache[272]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"The root of this plant is used by the Japanese as a size for their handmade papers, which are prepared from the inner bark of Edgeworthia gardneri and several varieties of the paper mulberry (Broussonetya papyrifera). The root is macerated in water and added to the paper pulp. The mucilage is obtained from the roots of this plant as follows:- Wash off the dirt, soak in fresh water for some hours, and crush them to pieces. The substance thus prepared should then be put in a linen bag and soaked again in water. When the material gets thoroughly soft, the juice comes out of the bag by manipulating in the vat in which pulp has been previously mixed to receive the paste. The bag should be squeezed now and then, as the mucilage does not come out by itself. The paper maker can judge whether sufficient mucilage is in the water or not by its glutinous consistency. This is the best mucilaginous plant extensively used in Japan[511 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A short-lived perennial shrub. Plants grow well in lowland tropical areas, with yields beginning to drop when they are grown at elevations above 500 metres. They may develop an annual habit of growth at higher elevations and in cooler climates[300 ]. They are generally tender in the temperate zone but can be grown outdoors as an annual, flowering well in their first year and setting seed[200 , K ]. They will occasionally overwinter in a cold greenhouse in the temperate zone[K ]. Plants have a high moisture requirement and grow best in areas with an evenly distributed annual precipitation of 1,000mm or more[300 ]. They prefer a relatively high humidity and a stable temperature above 25°c, though they can tolerate occasional short-lived lows down to about -5°c so long as they are in a very well-drained soil[260 , 300 ]. Easily grown in any well-drained soil in a sunny position[200 ]. Plants are most productive when grown in well-prepared fertile soils that are rich in organic matter[300 ]. When well looked after, the plant can be highly productive - yields of 40 - 60 tonnes per hectare have been achieved in the tropics[298 , 300 ]. A very variable plant[300 ]. Plants do not flower well when day length is less than 12 hours[300 ]. Plants are somewhat susceptible to root nematodes[298 ]. It grows well in an ornamental vegetable garden[200 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a warm greenhouse. The seed should germinate with two weeks, when it is large enough to handle prick it out into individual pots and plant out after the last expected frosts. The seed can also be sown in situ in late April in areas with warm summers."
