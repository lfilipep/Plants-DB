Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, the resulting progeny is usually sterile[200]. Fish like to spawn amongst this plant[74].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a pot that is standing in its own depth of water in a greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if this is possible. Stored seed is likely to have a short viability. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and increase the depth of water around the pot until the plants are covered by a few centimetres of water. Grow the plants on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter, increasing the depth of water as the plants grow larger. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring[56]. Cuttings of erect shoots in the growing season[56].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
