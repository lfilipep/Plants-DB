4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prunus pumila is a deciduous Shrub growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 159, 161]. A reasonable size, up to 10mm in diameter with one large seed[200], this is the largest of the N. American cherries[213]. A rich and pleasantly acid taste when fully ripe though they are sometimes slightly bitter[2, 11, 101, 183]. Eaten out of hand, used in preserves or dried for later use[183]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.",
23,Other Uses Description,A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168]. Used as a rootstock for the sour cherry[160].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[1, 11]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11]. Prefers some chalk in the soil but apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Established plants are very drought resistant[160]. This species is hardy to about -35°c when the plants are fully dormant[160], though the young growth in spring is fairly tender[K]. Plants are susceptible to mildew in low areas[160]. Plants thrive in areas with a short growing season[160]. The fruits are highly resistant to all fruit worms[160]. Plants can produce fruit in 3 years from seed[160]. A single plant, growing at Hilliers Arboretum in 1999, produced a good crop of fruit with viable seed, so the species is almost certainly self-fertile[K]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200]. Layering in spring.",
