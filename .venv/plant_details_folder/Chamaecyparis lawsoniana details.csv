Form: Columnar, Oval, Pyramidal, Upright or erect.","Chamaecyparis lawsoniana is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Cupressus lawsoniana.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Ground Cover; Hedge;,None known,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Any trimming should be done in the summer[200]. Certain dwarf forms can be used for ground cover, the cultivars 'Knowefieldensis', 'Nidiformis' and 'Tamariscifolia' have been recommended[208]. The branches have been used to make brooms[257].  - very close-grained, hard, strong, durable, easily worked, light, abounding in fragrant resin, acid resistant. One of the world's finest timbers, it is widely used for flooring, fencing, making boats etc[46, 61, 82, 171]. It is now in short supply due to over-harvesting without replanting[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Hedge, Screen, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils and situations, but prefers a moist deep loamy soil and a sheltered position[1, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Survives on dry alkaline soils[200]. Growth of trees is hardly affected by a lack of phosphate in the soil. Plants are moderately shade tolerant, especially when young[81, 200]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution according to one report[200], whilst another says that they do not do well in a polluted atmosphere[1]. A fairly wind tolerant plant, but it does not like severe maritime exposure[75]. Plants are susceptible to wind burn and recover variably[75]. This species is hardy to about -25°c[200]. A fairly long-lived tree in the wild with specimens 500 - 600 years old[229]. It is a very valuable timber tree in N. America and it is sometimes cultivated as a forestry tree in Britain, where it occasionally self-sows[1, 11]. It establishes well and grows quickly. New shoots can make 1 metre in a year but trees rarely maintain that rate and 30cm is nearer the average[185]. New growth starts very slowly in April, speeds up in June and ceases in September[185]. A very uniform species in the wild[200], in cultivation it is polymorphic and there are many named varieties[1, 185, 200]. The crushed foliage has a pungent smell[245]. Favoured by many birds for roosting, providing high cover and especially for nesting, large specimens of this tree help to attract songbirds to the garden[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow March/April in a seedbed outdoors[78]. The seed is best sown in pots in a frame[K]. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. One month warm then one month cold stratification has produced good results[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in late summer or autumn in sandy soil in a cold frame[1, 11, 200]. Difficult, it may be best done in late winter to early spring[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
