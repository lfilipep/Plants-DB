Used for bearings, turnery, cabinet work, ornamental uses etc[46, 61, 139].",,"Succeeds in a well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. Requires a warm sheltered position[202]. It grows best in the warmer areas of the country where the wood will be more readily ripened and better able to withstand winter cold[219]. Hardy to about -10°c[200], it succeeds in the open in southern and south-western Britain but is best grown against a wall elsewhere[11, 184]. Plants are of slow to moderate growth[202]. In good summers plants set abundant seed in this country[219]. Plants should be container-grown and planted out whilst young, older plants do not transplant well[219]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in hot (not boiling) water and sow in late winter in a greenhouse[78]. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into individual pots in the greenhouse, and grow them on for 2 years under protected conditions. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their third year. Cuttings of young shoots with a heel, July/August in a frame[11].
