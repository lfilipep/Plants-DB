21,Other Uses Description,"A yellow-tan dye is obtained from the leaves[106, 115]. Wood - heavy, tough, durable, fine grained, hard. Used by cabinet and instrument makers[11, 61, 100, 149]. When covered with black varnish it is an excellent ebony substitute[74].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A hybrid of the European Pear (Pyrus communis) and the Common Whitebeam (Sorbus aria). For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types, if they are moderately fertile[200], avoiding only the most acid soils[186]. Dislikes very exposed positions[186]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to below -15°c[200]. Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat. The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.) The cultivar Shipova is a small to medium size tree with roundish to slightly pear shaped, seedless, fruit, about the size of a large apricot; skin is a deep yellow with a delicious flavour and delicate rose-like aroma.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. The seed of pear cultivars will not usually breed true to type.",
