13,Summary,"Bloom Color: White.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Aronia arbutifolia is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105]. It can also be dried and used for making pemmican[161, 183]. Fruit quality is rather variable, some forms are rather pleasant when fully ripe, especially if they have experienced some frost[2]. The fruit is about 7mm in diameter[200], it can hang on the plant for several months[235].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Foundation, Pest tolerant, Massing, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a moist peaty soil in full sun or partial shade[134]. Succeeds in most soils[1] but dislikes shallow chalk[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[227]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. This genus is closely related to Sorbus species[200]. A suckering plant, it forms thickets in the wild[182]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 4. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in pots outdoors or in a cold frame[113]. Pre-soak stored seed overnight and then cold stratify for 3 months at 2°c[113]. The seed germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[200]. Very easy, they can be planted straight out into their permanent positions. Layering[200].",
