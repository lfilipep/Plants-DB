24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[74]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Cultivated for its edible fruit in China and Japan, there are many named varieties. A hybrid between this plant and P. communis culta is more suitable for warmer climates. The leaves are remarkably variable in shape[11]. Trees are used in the re-afforestation of arid areas[74]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year."
