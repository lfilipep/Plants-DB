Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[74]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Cultivated for its edible fruit in China and Japan, there are many named varieties. A hybrid between this plant and P. communis culta is more suitable for warmer climates. The leaves are remarkably variable in shape[11]. Trees are used in the re-afforestation of arid areas[74].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
