22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers an open well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds on most soils but dislikes calcareous soils[11, 200]. Prefers a pH between 5 and 7, but dislikes acid peats[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], in Britain it is only hardy south and west of mid Sussex[1]. Trees are growing well at Crarae in western Scotland[191]. Trees have poor wind resistance in Britain, probably because they grow so fast[11]. Trees up to 4 metres tall can be successfully established, though the optimum size for transplanting is about 30 - 80cm. The roots are very sensitive to desiccation and extreme care should be taken when transplanting them[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cool greenhouse or cold frame. Spring-sown seed requires 2 - 3 months stratification at 1 - 5°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed must not be allowed to dry out according to one report[80] whilst another says that the seed can be stored dry at 2°c for long periods[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Layering.",
