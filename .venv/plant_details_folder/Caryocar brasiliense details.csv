It is relatively slow-growing and drought tolerant when fully established. It grows up to 10 m tall with a crooked bole, deep taproot, and rounded, spreading crown. The palmate leaves are large, tough, and hairy. The flowers are hermaphrodite and yellowish-white in colour. The fruit is dark purple but turns to green as it ripens. It is strongly scented with a sweet, fleshy pulp. The seeds yield edible oil which is mainly used for flavouring, in cosmetics, soap making, as an illuminant and lubricant. Pequi has several medicinal uses. In particular, the bark is used to induce urination and reduce fever, and the fruits and seed oil (with honey) can both be used separately against cold and bronchitis. The wood is used for engraving, construction, furniture, etc.","Caryocar brasiliense is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bats, Insects. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Acantacaryx pinguis Arruda ex Koster Caryocar intermedium Wittm.,,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","portion: Fruit, Nut. The oily, mucilaginous fruit is nutritious[ 324 ]. A strongly scented, fleshy pulp[ 416 , 419 ]. It has a sweet flavour, but is an acquired taste and is mainly used as a flavouring or as a famine food[ 324 ]. The fruit is eaten fresh or used for sweets and liqueur. The fruit, including the seed, is cooked with rice[ 419 ]. A kind of butter and suet are extracted from the fruit[ 419 ]. The kernel is rarely eaten because of endocarp spines[ 324 ]. The seed has a large number of small spines which can injure the mucous membranes of the mouth[ 419 ]. The seeds are the source of an edible oil that is mainly used for flavouring[ 324 ]. The high melting point of the oil may give it potential as a cocoa butter substitute[ 324 ]","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  FebrifugeThe flowers, fruits and seeds are used in local medicine[ 324 ]. The bark is diuretic and febrifuge[ 739 ]. The fruits are used in the treatment of the common cold and bronchitis[ 739 ]. The seed oil, combined with honey, is used in the treatment of the common cold and bronchitis[ 739 ].

Other Uses The oil from the seed is used in the cosmetic industry and locally for making soap, as an illuminant and lubricant[ 324 ]. The leaves, bark and fruit pulp are a source of tannin[ 324 ]. The wood is moderately heavy, soft, of good natural durability. It is used for engraving, construction, wooden machinery parts, furniture, fences etc[ 324 , 419 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[ 324 ]. Attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds. Suitable for xeriscaping.","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of the drier tropics and subtropics, it grows naturally in areas with an annual rainfall of 1,000 - 1,500 mm and a dry season of 3 - 5 months, with relative humidity as low as 13%[ 324 ]. Requires a sunny position[ 419 ]. Adapted to nutrient-poor, heavy clays, especially iron and aluminium-rich soils[ 324 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 324 , 419 ]. Large trees may yield up to 2,000 fruits[ 324 ]. A fairly slow-growing tree, reaching a height of up to 1.5 metres when two years old[ 419 ]. The tree has potential as an oil crop for the drier regions of the world, being well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils and long dry seasons[ 324 ]. A cultivated fruit tree. Self-fertile but more fruit is produced with cross-pollination.","Seeds - they contain a germination inhibitor and can take one year to germinate;[ 324 , 419 ]. Stratification of the endocarp with mesocarp removed is recommended[ 324 ]. Alternatively, immerse the seeds in warm water for 48 hours, changing the water every 12 hours[ 419 ]. Sow the seed in individual containers in a sunny or lightly shaded position. Pre-soaked seed can sprout within 30 - 50 days with a moderate germination rate[ 419 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 25 cm tall[ 324 ]. Good results can be obtained from grafting and marcottage[ 324 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
