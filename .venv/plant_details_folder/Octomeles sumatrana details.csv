It is fast-growing and evergreen, with a semi-globose crown and a straight, buttressed bole which can be about 400 cm in diameter. The extract of leaves are used as relief from stomach pains. Young leaves can be cooked and eaten as vegetables. Ilimo tree has an extensive root system making it ideal for preventing soil erosion in sloping areas. It is also a pioneer species and resistant to fire damage. The bark yields dye. The wood is light, fairly soft, and only used for match boxes, concrete moulds, pallets, etc. It is also used for pulp."
14,Physical Characteristics,Octomeles sumatrana is an evergreen Tree growing to 50 m (164ft) by 30 m (98ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils.

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Young leaves - cooked and eaten as a vegetable[451 ].
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.A leaf extract is used to cure stomach-ache[325 ].
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The trees extensive root system binds the soil, making it an ideal plant for stabilizing river banks[451 ]. The tree is actually a pioneer species in the rainforest, rapidly invading new banks of alluvial soil built up by the rivers, but unable to regenerate once other trees close the canopy below them[451 ]. Other Uses A dye is obtained from the bark[418 ]. The heartwood is absent. The wood is light, relatively soft, coarse-textured, brittle and with poor resistance to decomposition. It is only suitable for use under cover where a weak, perishable timber will suffice, being employed to make match boxes, concrete moulds, pallets etc, and for pulp[325, 451]. The colossal stems are, however, suitable for making large canoes[451 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A tree of the moist, lowland tropics where it is generally found at elevations below 1,000 metres[451 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 29 - 34c, but can tolerate 20 - 38c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 3,000 - 4,000mm, but tolerates 2,000 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position[325 ]. Succeeds in alluvial soils, clays and sandy loams[325 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 4.5 - 5.5, tolerating 4 - 6.5[418 ]. Trees can be exceptionally fast growing, with one report of a 4-year old specimen having attained a height of 25 metres and a bole diameter of 47cm[451 ]. Annual wood production potential is 25 - 40 cubic metres per hectare[418 ]. Trees are resistant to fire damage[451 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[325 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a fairly short viability and should be sown before it is 12 months old[451 ]. It does not have a dormancy, and pre-treatment is not necessary. It probably germinates better in a sunny position. Seeds are sown in a nursery seedbed and only just covered, Germination will usually take place within 7 days. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they have 4 leaves and place in semi-shade for one week before returning them to a sunny position[325 ]. Plant out when 30cm tall[325 ]."
