Plants are quite tolerant of shade though do not fruit so well in such a position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. A low-growing plant, the branches creep along the ground, forming roots as they grw[266]. This species is closely related to R. fragrans[200]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so they should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at between 0 and 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200]. Division of plants in the dormant season. The low branches form roots as they grow and these can be separated from the plant - bigger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though smaller ones are best potted up and then planted out during the summer[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
