It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[195]. They have a small degree of acridity when raw but this is removed if they are boiled in water, they are then eaten in salads etc[183]. The shoots, which are about 35mm in diameter[266], are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level."

22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The canes are used for plant supports, making musical pipes and weaving baskets etc[195, 266]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position and plenty of moisture in the growing season. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. It dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. Cultivated for its edible shoots in China[195]. Plants show a remarkably high survival rate when planted out[195]. Commercial plantings in America averaged around 86% success rate[195]. (This probably refers to divisions) In tests in Alabama, USA, this species was considerably more productive than any other member of this genus in producing canes as measured by number and by weight of the wood[195]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring."
