13,Summary,"A long-lived prostrate, scrambling vine with stems up to 1.5 m long with a strong taproot. Occasionally a semi-upright shrubby plant growing 0.5m tall."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Desmodium intortum is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil."

20,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
21,Other Uses Description,"Long-term and irrigated pastures for hay and silage - provides good standover feed during autumn and winter in frost-free areas. Very palatable and tends to be heavily grazed. Cut-and-carry systems, and as ground cover. DM yields range from 12 to 19 t/ha/year, which is higher than silverleaf desmodium (7-9 t DM/ha/year). Better yields are obtained with longer cutting intervals of 30-85 days [418]. A good groundcover covering the soil in 4 months. It has been used as ground cover on coffee plantations. Carbon Farming Solutions - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, understory legume. : pasture (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland)."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Pasture  Management: Fodder  Minor Global CropClimate: tropical, tropical highlands. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Desmodium intortum will grow on a wider range of soils than will D. uncinatum , from sands, light loams to medium clays, but prefers moderate fertility and pH above 5.0. Not tolerant of salinity or high Al and Mn. Requires >900mm rainfall with a moderate dry season of less than 6 months, but will grow under much wetter conditions (>3,000 mm).  Tolerance to waterlogging or flooding is better than D. uncinatum .  Withstands hot weather better than D. uncinatum. Frost-susceptible.  Optimum growth at 30/25°C ±3°C. Good shade tolerance. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: fodder (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed germinates quickly (3-4 days) without scarification.
