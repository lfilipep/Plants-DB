Very palatable and tends to be heavily grazed. Cut-and-carry systems, and as ground cover. DM yields range from 12 to 19 t/ha/year, which is higher than silverleaf desmodium (7-9 t DM/ha/year). Better yields are obtained with longer cutting intervals of 30-85 days [418]. A good groundcover covering the soil in 4 months. It has been used as ground cover on coffee plantations.

Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Desmodium intortum will grow on a wider range of soils than will D. uncinatum , from sands, light loams to medium clays, but prefers moderate fertility and pH above 5.0. Not tolerant of salinity or high Al and Mn. Requires >900mm rainfall with a moderate dry season of less than 6 months, but will grow under much wetter conditions (>3,000 mm).  Tolerance to waterlogging or flooding is better than D. uncinatum .  Withstands hot weather better than D. uncinatum. Frost-susceptible.  Optimum growth at 30/25°C ±3°C. Good shade tolerance.
