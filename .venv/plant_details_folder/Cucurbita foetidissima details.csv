It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

19,Edible Uses Description,"it - cooked[105]. Used as a vegetable, it can also be dried for later use[161, 183]. The young fruit is used, it is bitter and becomes more bitter as it gets older[183]. One report says that the fruit contains up to 23% protein[213], though this would be very unusual in a fruit[K]. The fruit is up to 7cm in diameter[200]. Seed - raw or cooked[46, 61, 86, 92, 94]. The seeds can be ground into a powder and used as a thickening in soups or can be mixed with cereal flours when making cakes and biscuits[183, 257]. Rich in oil with a very pleasant nutty flavour, but very fiddly to use because the seed is small and covered with a fibrous coat[K]. The seed contains 30 - 35% protein and 34% oil[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183]. Root - the source of a starch that is used as a sweetener, stabilizer or for making puddings like tapioca[183]. Some caution is advised, see notes on toxicity[207]. The flowers are said to be edible after preparation[183] but no more details are given.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Laxative  Poultice  VermifugeBuffalo gourd was employed medicinally by many native North American tribes who used it particularly in the treatment of skin complaints[257]. It is still employed in modern herbalism as a safe and effective vermicide[238]. The leaves, stems and roots are laxative and poultice[46, 61, 92, 94]. The root is used mainly, but some caution is advised because of a report that it can be poisonous[207]. A poultice of the mashed plant has been used to treat skin sores, ulcers etc[257]. The seeds are vermifuge[7, 88]. The complete seed, together with the husk, is used. This is ground into a fine flour, then made into an emulsion with water and eaten. It is then necessary to take a purgative afterwards in order to expel the tapeworms or other parasites from the body[7]. As a remedy for internal parasites, the seeds are less potent than the root of Dryopteris felix-mas, but they are safer for pregnant women, debilitated patients and children[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Darning ball: ,Musical: Specific mention of plants used as musical instruments. Does not include the various woods that can be used for making musical instruments.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,Starch: Used as a fabric stiffener.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The fruit is used as a soap substitute[94, 95, 169]. The fruit is cut up and simmered in water to obtain the soap which can be used for removing stains[92]. The fruit can also be dried and stored for later use[92]. It is often used with the root which is also a soap substitute[92]. The soap is said to be effective in removing stains from clothing[257]. The dried fruits have a tough, thick skin. They can be used whole as rattles or can be carved to make ladles, spoons etc[94, 95, 257]. The root is a rich source of starch[177]. (Industrial uses?)",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  New Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilRequires a rich, well-drained moisture retentive soil and a very warm, sunny and sheltered position[1, 200]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[117]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it is usually grown as an annual in temperate climates[200]. The roots can survive temperatures down to about -25°c[160]. Does not hybridize naturally with other members of this genus though crosses have been made under controlled conditions[86].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse in a rich soil. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Sow 2 or 3 seeds per pot and thin out to the best plant. Grow them on fast and plant out after the last expected frosts, giving them cloche or frame protection for at least their first few weeks if you are trying them outdoors.",
