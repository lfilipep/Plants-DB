This species is hardy to about -10°c, and perhaps more when growing in a suitable site[200]. It does not thrive in areas where the summers are long and hot[200]. A polymorphic species[44]. A good plant for the rock garden[1], it can be invasive though and has become a lawn weed in some gardens[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame in the autumn[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in the autumn. Overwinter the plants in a cold greenhouse and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of basal shoots in early summer. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
