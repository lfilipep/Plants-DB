14,Physical Characteristics,"Acer spicatum is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft 10in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"ugar is obtained from the sap. The sap can be used as a drink or boiled down to make maple syrup[183]. The syrup is used as a sweetener on many foods. The sap can be harvested in late winter, the flow is best on a warm sunny day after a frost. Trees on southern slopes in sandy soils give the best yields. The best sap production comes from cold-winter areas with continental climates."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Ophthalmic  PoulticeThe North American Indians made an infusion of the pith of young twigs and used this as eye drops to soothe irritation caused by campfire smoke[226, 257]. The pith itself was used to remove foreign matter from the eyes[257]. An infusion or poultice made from the outer bark has been used to treat sore eyes[257]. A poultice made from boiled root chips has been applied externally to wounds and abscesses[257]. A compound infusion of the roots and bark is used to treat internal haemorrhage[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are packed around apples, rootcrops etc to help preserve them[18, 20]. The bark contains tannins, but the report does not say in what quantity[223]. The trees have an extensive root system that can be used to bind the soil. They are often grown on banks in order to prevent soil erosion[226]. The wood is close-grained, soft and light, weighing 33lb per cubic foot[82, 235]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Woodland garden. Of easy cultivation, it prefers a sunny position and a good moist well-drained soil but succeeds on most soils, especially those on the acid side, and dislikes alkaline soils[182]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are hardy to about -35°c when fully dormant. The lower branches of trees often self-layer, the trees then forming an impenetrable thicket[226]. Most maples are bad companion plants, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20].  Special Features:North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the following spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours and then stratify for 2 - 4 months at 1 - 8°c. It can be slow to germinate. The seed can be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has dried and produced any germination inhibitors) and sown immediately. It should germinate in late winter. If the seed is harvested too soon it will produce very weak plants or no plants at all[80, 113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 20cm or more tall before planting them out in their permanent positions. Layering, which takes about 12 months, is successful with most species in this genus. Plants often self-layer in the wild[226]. Cuttings of young shoots in June or July. The cuttings should have 2 - 3 pairs of leaves, plus one pair of buds at the base. Remove a very thin slice of bark at the base of the cutting, rooting is improved if a rooting hormone is used. The rooted cuttings must show new growth during the summer before being potted up otherwise they are unlikely to survive the winter. Strong plants are usually produced by this method."
