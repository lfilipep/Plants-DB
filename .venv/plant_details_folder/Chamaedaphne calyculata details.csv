24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a moist well-drained lime-free soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 200]. Best if given some protection from the midday sun[1]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value. 'Nana' is a dwarf compact form that is good for shady areas[183]. The flowers have a delicate refreshing scent[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February in a lime-free compost in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[78]. Do not allow the compost to dry out and keep the pot in a shady position. Germination is usually fair, taking 1 - 12 months at 15°c, though 4 weeks cold stratification may reduce this time[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[164]. Cuttings of almost ripe side-shoots, 4 - 5cm long with a heel, August in a frame. A variable degree of success[78]. It can help to prune the plants lightly after flowering in order to encourage vigorous growth from which to take the cuttings[78]. Layering in August. Takes 18 months. High percentage[78].",
