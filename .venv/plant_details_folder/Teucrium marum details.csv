The plant is supposed to possess very active powers and has been recommended in the treatment of many diseases, being considered useful in most nervous complaints[4]. It is used in the treatment of gallbladder and stomach problems[254]. The root bark is considerably astringent and has been used for checking haemorrhages[4].

Does well in dry places in the rock garden[1]. Plants are not fully hardy in Britain, they can be killed in severe winters especially if the weather is wet[4]. The bruised leaves release a pungent aroma[245]. Cats are strongly attracted to this plant and may tear it to pieces[11, 182, K]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if they are large enough. Otherwise, grow them on in a cold frame for the winter and plant them out in the following spring. Division in early spring[1]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
