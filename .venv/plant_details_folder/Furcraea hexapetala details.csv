Plants are monocarpic - they live for a number of years without flowering, then put all their energy into flowering and die afterwards[200 ]. Occurs in climates with good light with temperature between 17 and 24 ? C, relative humidity between 50 and 70%. Prefers clay-clayey soils, well aerated and with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0. It can be propagated sexually by entomophilic pollination, but it must spread asexually through bulbils or suckers, which after falling to the ground, grow easily.","Seed - rarely produced[200 ]. Plants frequently produce large numbers of bulbils, which root and grow into new plants when they fall to the ground[200 ]. These bulbils have the capacity to remain viable for a number of years, even in unfavourable conditions[200 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
