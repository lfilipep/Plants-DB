25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropRequires a well-drained soil and a sunny position[200 ]. Plants are monocarpic - they live for a number of years without flowering, then put all their energy into flowering and die afterwards[200 ]. Occurs in climates with good light with temperature between 17 and 24 ? C, relative humidity between 50 and 70%. Prefers clay-clayey soils, well aerated and with a pH between 5.0 and 7.0. It can be propagated sexually by entomophilic pollination, but it must spread asexually through bulbils or suckers, which after falling to the ground, grow easily."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - rarely produced[200 ]. Plants frequently produce large numbers of bulbils, which root and grow into new plants when they fall to the ground[200 ]. These bulbils have the capacity to remain viable for a number of years, even in unfavourable conditions[200 ]."
