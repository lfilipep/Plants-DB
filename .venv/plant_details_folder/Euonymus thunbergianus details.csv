It is possibly no more than a synonym of E. alatus[109, 275]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Thriving in almost any soil, including chalk, it is particularly suited to dry shaded areas[200]. Prefers a well-drained loamy soil[11].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[121]. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification, so should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[113]. The seed can take 18 months to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm long taken at a node or with a heel, July/August in a frame.
