Form: Prostrate, Spreading or horizontal.","Cotoneaster conspicuus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, midges. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; Hedge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants are fairly wind-resistant and can be grown as part of a shelterbelt[200]. The cultivar 'Red Glory' is taller growing than the type species and so would probably be of more use[K]. Some cultivars are suitable for growing as a ground cover, the cultivar 'Decorus' has been recommended[208]. 'Flameburst', Red Pearl' and 'Tiny Tim', are also low-growing and would possibly be of use for ground cover[K].",,"Landscape Uses:Container, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden. An easily grown plant, it prefers a good soil but also does well in poor soils[1, 11, 200]. It thrives in lime and is also happy in peaty soils[1]. It succeeds in any soil that is not marshy or waterlogged[11, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[208]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade but does not fruit so freely in a shady position[11, 200]. Grows well on the sunny side of a woodland edge[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and windy sites[200]. This species is hardy to about -18°c[202]. Plants are normally of a low growing and spreading habit, though they are sometimes almost prostrate and at other times taller and fairly erect[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. There are a number of named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The flowers, when inhaled near to, have an unpleasant smell like decaying fish[245]. They are very attractive to bees whilst the fruit is a good winter food source for many species of birds[200]. The fruit of this species is not very attractive to birds and normally hangs on the bush throughout the winter[11].  Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed. Members of this genus hybridize freely so, if you require seed that breeds true, it is important to obtain it from a known wild source or from a controlled fertilization of garden plants. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it will usually germinate in the spring[11, 200]. Stored seed germinates faster if given 3 months warm stratification at 15°c and then 3 months cold stratification at 4°c[164]. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 18 months at 15°c but it can take 2 years[164]. Pot the seedlings up as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into nursery beds or into their permanent positions when they are more than 10cm tall.
