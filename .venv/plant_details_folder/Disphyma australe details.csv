25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very well-drained soil and a sunny position[1, 200]. It does not need a rich soil and is probably hardier when grown in poorer soils[200]. Plants grow well by the coast, tolerating maritime exposure[1]. This species is not very cold-hardy in Britain, it can be grown as an annual, flowering and setting seed in its first year from seed[1]. It is also possible to take cuttings in the summer and overwinter them in the greenhouse[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in the summer."
