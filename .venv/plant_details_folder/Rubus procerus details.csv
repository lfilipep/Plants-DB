24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. A form of this species, known as 'Himalayan giant', is commonly cultivated in temperate zones for its edible fruit[50]. Although a blackberry, the stems are often perennial and can fruit for more than one year[50]. This name may be wrongly applied . According to the new RHS Dictionary of Gardening, the correct name for the 'Himalayan Giant' blackberry is R. procerus. P.J.Muell., the name R. discolor is misapplied. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",
