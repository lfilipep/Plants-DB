24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. It is likely to require a sunny position and a well-drained soil. A very variable plant, there are many sub-species[43, 236].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in early spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
