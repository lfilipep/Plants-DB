0,Podophyllum hexandrum,Himalayan May Apple,Podophyllaceae,5-9,"The leaves and the roots are poisonous[2]. Only the root is poisonous, it is more toxic than P. peltatum[19].","Scrub forests and alpine meadows[187], usually in humus rich soils, 2000 - 3500 metres in the Himalayas[130, 145]. Very abundant in fir forests in Kashmir[211].",E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",P. emodi.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw. It must only be eaten when it is fully ripe[1, 2, 61, 105]. Juicy but insipid[130]. The fruit is about 5cm long[200]. The leaves are edible according to one report but this must be treated with some caution, see notes on toxicity above[183].","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Cytostatic: Slows or controls the growth of tumours.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Cancer  Cholagogue  Cytostatic  PurgativeThe whole plant, but especially the root, is cholagogue, cytostatic and purgative. The plant contains podophyllin, which has an antimiotic effect (it interferes with cell division and can thus prevent the growth of cells). It is, therefore, a possible treatment for cancer, and has been used especially in the treatment of ovarian cancer[46, 51, 57, 64, 65, 124, 244]. However, alopecia is said to be a common side-effect of this treatment[244]. This species contains about twice the quantity of active ingredient than P. peltatum[211]. The roots contain several important anti-cancer lignans, including podophyllin and berberine[218]. The roots are also antirheumatic[218]. The root is harvested in the autumn and either dried for later use or the resin is extracted[238]. This plant is highly poisonous and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238].",,A medicinal resin is obtained from the plant. It is extracted with alcohol[64].,,"Prefers a moist peaty soil and filtered light or shade[111, 187]. Grows well in a moist open woodland[28, 31, 200]. Hardy to about -20°c[187], it takes some years to become established[124] but is very long lived in a suitable habitat[130]. Young leaves may be damaged by late frosts but otherwise the plants are quite hardy[130]. Over collection of the plant from the wild is becomimg a cause for concern as local populations are being endangered[272]. Young plants only produce one leaf each year, older plants have 2 or 3 leaves each year[211]. Plants in this genus have excited quite a lot of interest for the compounds found in their roots which have been shown to have anti-cancer activity[124]. There are various research projects under way (as of 1990)[124]. The sub-species P. hexandrum chinense. Wall. has larger flowers and more deeply divided leaves[187].",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in a cold frame in early spring. The seed germinates in 1 - 4 months at 15°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a shady part of the greenhouse for at least 2 growing seasons. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the winter when the plants are dormant.
