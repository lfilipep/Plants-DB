It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,None known,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hydrogogue: A purgative that causes an abundant watery discharge.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Depurative  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Hydrogogue  Purgative  Stimulant  StypticThe stem bark is febrifuge, stimulant and styptic[218, 240]. The bark, flowers and leaves are considered to be hydrogogue and a drastic purgative[240]. A paste of the flowers is applied externally to cuts and wounds[272]. The root is astringent, detoxicant and diuretic[147, 218]. A decoction of the flowers is used in the treatment of colds[218].",Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,- hard. A useful timber[146].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Pollard, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny sheltered position[184, 200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in soils low in nutrients[200]. Dislikes very alkaline soils[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -10°c if the wood is well ripened[184]. They require very hot and humid summers and preferably the protection of a south facing wall if they are to flower in Britain[182, 260]. Plants are hardy in a very sunny position in southern England but they only flower in consistently warm summers[11]. Plants are much hardier when the wood is thoroughly ripened by the sun[166, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200]. Flowers are produced in broad panicles on the tips of the current years growth[219]. Any pruning is best carried out in the spring in order to encourage new growth[219]. Young plants grow fairly quickly and will often flower in their first year after planting out[219]. Plants do not transplant well and should be moved with a large rootball[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[78]. Another report says to sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in the winter in a frame[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long in December. High percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
