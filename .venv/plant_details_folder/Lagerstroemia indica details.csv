22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Pollard, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny sheltered position[184, 200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in soils low in nutrients[200]. Dislikes very alkaline soils[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -10°c if the wood is well ripened[184]. They require very hot and humid summers and preferably the protection of a south facing wall if they are to flower in Britain[182, 260]. Plants are hardy in a very sunny position in southern England but they only flower in consistently warm summers[11]. Plants are much hardier when the wood is thoroughly ripened by the sun[166, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200]. Flowers are produced in broad panicles on the tips of the current years growth[219]. Any pruning is best carried out in the spring in order to encourage new growth[219]. Young plants grow fairly quickly and will often flower in their first year after planting out[219]. Plants do not transplant well and should be moved with a large rootball[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[78]. Another report says to sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in the winter in a frame[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long in December. High percentage[78]."
