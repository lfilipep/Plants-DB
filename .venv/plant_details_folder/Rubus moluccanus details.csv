In the temperate zone, it can only be grown in regions with mild winters.Easily grown in a good well-drained, loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200].The plant spreads by means of bird-sown seeds and vegetatively to form thickets. It has escaped from cultivation and become a weed in several areas, including the Mascarene Islands and southeastern N. America[413].There is at least one named variety occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit. 'Keri' (or Keriberry) is a very vigorous plant with mild-flavoured large black fruits that lack the distinctive flavour of blackberries[183].Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
