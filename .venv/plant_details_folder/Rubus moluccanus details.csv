24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Rubus moluccanus has a wide native range from the Himalayas through tropical southeast Asia to eastern Australia, where it can be found as far south as the warm temperate zone of Victoria. In the temperate zone, it can only be grown in regions with mild winters.Easily grown in a good well-drained, loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200].The plant spreads by means of bird-sown seeds and vegetatively to form thickets. It has escaped from cultivation and become a weed in several areas, including the Mascarene Islands and southeastern N. America[413].There is at least one named variety occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit. 'Keri' (or Keriberry) is a very vigorous plant with mild-flavoured large black fruits that lack the distinctive flavour of blackberries[183].Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]."
