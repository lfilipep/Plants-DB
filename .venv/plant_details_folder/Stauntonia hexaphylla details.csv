Hand pollination may improve fruit set[166]. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 18 months to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.
