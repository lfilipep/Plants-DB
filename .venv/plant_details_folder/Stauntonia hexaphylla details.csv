24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil in a sheltered position[200]. Succeeds in acid or alkaline soils, in full sun or in semi-shade[200]. It grows best if its roots are in a shady position and the top is allowed to grow into the sun[K]. A very ornamental plant, it is only hardy outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[3, 11, 59], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c when the plant is fully dormant[184]. The young growth in spring, however, can be damaged by late frosts. It is cultivated for its edible fruit in Japan. The flowers have a pleasant sweet perfume[245]. A climbing plant that supports itself by twining around other plants and supports[219]. Plants are dioecious but females have borne fruit at times in the absence of a male pollinator[11, 200]. We have had a report of a single plant in Christchurch New Zealand producing continually after three years old. In Britain fruit is usually only formed in sunny summers[166, 219]. Hand pollination may improve fruit set[166]. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 18 months to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings.
