17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - cooked. Rather bitter and aromatic[115], they were used as a potherb by the ancient Romans[183] but are rarely used at present. Root - candied and eaten as a sweetmeat[4, 7, 27, 105, 183]. It contains up to 44% inulin[46, 240]. Inulin is a starch that cannot be digested by humans. It usually passes straight through the digestive system, though it can ferment and cause wind problems for some people[K]. Inulin can be converted into a sugar that is suitable for diabetics to eat[238]. The Council of Europe list Inula helenium as a natural food flavouring."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Anthelmintic  Antiseptic  Antitussive  Astringent  Bitter  Cholagogue  Demulcent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Stimulant  Stomachic  TonicElecampane has a long history of use as a medicinal herb. A gently warming and tonic herb, it is especially effective in treating coughs, consumption, bronchitis and many other complaints of the chest as well as disorders of the digestive system[4, 9, 254]. A very safe herb to use, it is suitable for the old and the young and especially useful when the patient is debilitated[254]. It cleanses toxins from the body, stimulating the immune and digestive systems and treating bacterial and fungal infections[238]. The root is alterative, anthelmintic, antiseptic, astringent, bitter, cholagogue, demulcent, diaphoretic, diuretic, mildly expectorant, gently stimulant, stomachic, tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 46. 165, 200, 218, 222]. It is best harvested in the autumn from plants that are two years old, and it can be dried for later use[4]. The roots should be at least 3 years old according to another report[7]. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238]. An extract of the plant is a powerful antiseptic and bactericide, particularly effective against the organism that causes TB[213, 238]. The root contains alantolactone, which is strongly anthelmintic. In a 1:1000 dilution it kills the parasitic worm Ascaris in 16 hours[218]. Alantolactone has an anti-inflammatory action, it also reduces mucous secretions and stimulates the immune system[254]. The plant is sometimes recommended as an external wash for skin inflammations and varicose ulcers, but has been known to cause allergic reactions[238]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"A blue dye is obtained from the bruised and macerated root mixed with ashes and whortleberries (Vaccinium myrtillus)[4, 46, 61]. The root yields up to 2% of a camphor-scented essential oil, this is used as a flavouring and medicinally[46, 61, 238]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it grows well in moist shady positions in ordinary garden soil, though it grows best in a good loamy soil[4]. Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil in a sunny position[1]. Plants are also tolerant of considerable neglect, succeeding on our Cornwall trial ground even when left unweeded for four years[K]. Elecampane has a long history of cultivation as a medicinal herb, though it is not commonly grown nowadays[4]. When first dug up, the roots smell like ripe bananas, but as they dry they take on the scent of violets[245]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in spring or autumn in a cold frame[4]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, it could be worthwhile trying an outdoor sowing in situ in the spring. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Fairly small pieces of root can be used, so long as each piece has a growth bud on it[4]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings in winter. Cut sections of root about 5cm long, place them in a warm greenhouse over the winter and they should grow away vigorously[4]."
