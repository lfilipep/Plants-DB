Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",F. elatior.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw. Sweet and succulent. The fruit is small but has an excellent flavour and is very aromatic[61, 142, 183, K]. It is greatly superior to the cultivated strawberries, but is not very freely produced[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It grows well amongst shrubs but is likely to suffocate smaller plants[K]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.",,"Prefers a fertile, well-drained, moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates semi-shade though fruit production will be reduced[38]. Another report says that this species prefers shade[74]. Succeeds in acid and alkaline soils[38]. Likes a mulch of pine or spruce leaves[18, 24]. At one time this species was widely cultivated for its edible fruit, but it is fairly low yielding and has now been almost totally superseded by cultivars of F. x. ananassa[17]. There are some named varieties[183]. The flowers are usually unisexual[200]. (This report does not say if the plants are dioecious or monoecious.) This species produces few or no stolons[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 4 weeks or more to germinate. The seedlings are very small and slow-growing at first, but then grow rapidly. Prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out during the summer. Division of runners, preferably done in July/August in order to allow the plants to become established for the following years crop[200]. They can also be moved in the following spring if required, though should not then be allowed to fruit in their first year. The runners can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
