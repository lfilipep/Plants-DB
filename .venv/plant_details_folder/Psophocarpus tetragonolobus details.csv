13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Psophocarpus tetragonolobus is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

19,Edible Uses Description,"Young seedpods - cooked for a few minutes[2, 46, 61, 116]. They tastes like French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)[183]. The pods are harvested when about 15 - 20 cm long and 2cm wide[200]. They will store for up to 21 days at 10°c with a relative humidity of 90%[200]. The yields of pods average 250 - 500g per m²[200]. Immature seeds are used in soups etc[183]. Mature seeds are eaten cooked[2, 46, 61, 116]. They are very nutritious, being rich in oil (up to 17%)[160], protein, vitamin E and calcium. The seed can also be roasted and eaten like peanuts or fermented and used as tempeh[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183]. Root - raw or cooked like potatoes[160, 183]. Slightly sweet, it contains 20% or more protein, which is about 12 times that of potatoes[116, 183]. Leaves and young shoots - cooked. They are used like spinach[61, 116, 183]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[183]. They have a flavour similar to mushrooms when sautéed[116]. The light blue flowers are also used as a colouring in foods[183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[183]."

22,Other Uses,"Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility."
23,Other Uses Description,"A very good green manure with exceptional nitrogen-fixing properties, producing a greater weight of nodules per plant than any other member of the Leguminosae[200]. It is used for soil improvement and restoration[200]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilPrefers a loamy slightly acidic soil, but there are cultivars suitable for many soil types[200]. Tolerates heavy soils[116] but dislikes wet soils[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. Very widely cultivated as a food plant in the tropics and sub-tropics, there are many named varieties[183]. It is usually treated as an annual. In temperate zones it has to be grown as an annual crop. Most varieties will only flower when daylight hours are around 12 per day[116] but day-neutral varieties are being developed that will flower in the summer in northerly and southerly latitudes[200]. Temperatures in the range of 25 - 30°c are necessary for optimum growth[200]. Plants take 60 - 80 days from sowing to the first harvest of seedpods[200]. Mature tubers can be harvested 120 - 240 days from sowing[200]. The plant is very disease resistant[160]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in early spring in a warm greenhouse. Place two or three seeds in each pot, thinning to the strongest plant. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts and give them the protection of a cloche or cold frame until they are growing away strongly[240]."
