See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Colouring: edible dyes,Oil: ,Oil: ","Young seedpods - cooked for a few minutes[2, 46, 61, 116]. They tastes like French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)[183]. The pods are harvested when about 15 - 20 cm long and 2cm wide[200]. They will store for up to 21 days at 10°c with a relative humidity of 90%[200]. The yields of pods average 250 - 500g per m²[200]. Immature seeds are used in soups etc[183]. Mature seeds are eaten cooked[2, 46, 61, 116]. They are very nutritious, being rich in oil (up to 17%)[160], protein, vitamin E and calcium. The seed can also be roasted and eaten like peanuts or fermented and used as tempeh[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183]. Root - raw or cooked like potatoes[160, 183]. Slightly sweet, it contains 20% or more protein, which is about 12 times that of potatoes[116, 183]. Leaves and young shoots - cooked. They are used like spinach[61, 116, 183]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[183]. They have a flavour similar to mushrooms when sautéed[116]. The light blue flowers are also used as a colouring in foods[183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Tolerates heavy soils[116] but dislikes wet soils[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. Very widely cultivated as a food plant in the tropics and sub-tropics, there are many named varieties[183]. It is usually treated as an annual. In temperate zones it has to be grown as an annual crop. Most varieties will only flower when daylight hours are around 12 per day[116] but day-neutral varieties are being developed that will flower in the summer in northerly and southerly latitudes[200]. Temperatures in the range of 25 - 30°c are necessary for optimum growth[200]. Plants take 60 - 80 days from sowing to the first harvest of seedpods[200]. Mature tubers can be harvested 120 - 240 days from sowing[200]. The plant is very disease resistant[160]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in early spring in a warm greenhouse. Place two or three seeds in each pot, thinning to the strongest plant. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts and give them the protection of a cloche or cold frame until they are growing away strongly[240].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
