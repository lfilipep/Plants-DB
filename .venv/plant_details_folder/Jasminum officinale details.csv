Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. They require the protection of a wall in northern Britain but are fully hardy in the south[11]. Another report says that they are hardy to about -10°c, and that the stem tips are often killed back in the winter though the plant soon recovers[202]. Climbs by means of twining[182]. It is self-supporting[200] and fast-growing[202]. Any pruning is best carried out in late winter and early spring[202]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are some named varieties[200]. The flowers are very fragrant[202] and the plant is sometimes cultivated for the essential oil in its flowers, the sub-species J. officinale grandiflorum (L.)Kobuski. is used[171]. Flowers are produced on the current year's growth and also on older wood[202]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy. Cuttings of mature wood in November. Layering."
