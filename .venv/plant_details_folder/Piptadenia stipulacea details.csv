13,Summary,"Commonly found in northeastern part of Brazil, Piptadenia stipulacea is a spiny shrub belonging in the legume family. It is characterized by a small and rounded crown, and short and crooked bole that can be up to 25 cm in diameter. It grows about 3 - 5 m in height and becomes highly tolerant to drought once established. It is a fast-growing species and can be a potential weed in some areas. There is no known medicinal and edible uses of this plant but its wood has been used for fences, posts, and small constructions. It is also used for fuel and charcoal.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Piptadenia stipulacea is a deciduous Tree growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

20,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:A very fast-growing plant that is easy to propagate; succeeds in full sun; tolerates dry and infertile soils; fixes atmospheric nitrogen and rapidly invades open areas - it is a very good plant to use as a pioneer when restoring native woodland or when establishing a woodland garden[625, K].Other Uses: The wood is medium-textured, irregular to spiral-grained, heavy, hard to cut, very durable. A good wood, but generally only available in small sizes and so only used outdoors for fences, posts etc and indoors for small constructions[625].The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[625].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the 'Caatinga' dry forest region of northeast Brazil. The climate is hot and dry, there are usually 6 to 11 months without rain each year. The mean annual rainfall varies from 250 - 1,000mm, and the mean annual temperature is from 24 - 26°c. Grows best in a sunny position[625 ]. Succeeds in dry soils and infertile soils[625 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[625 ]. The plant rapidly invades open areas and so is sometimes seen as a weed[625 ]. A very fast-growing plant[625 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. A high germination rate can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 10 - 20 days[625].Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[K].",
