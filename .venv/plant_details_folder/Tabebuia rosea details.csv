The leaves are compound. Other common names are Pink Poui and Roble de Sabana. It is the national tree of El Salvador. It has a spreading crown and an often buttressed, straight bole that can be up to 1 m in diameter. The flowers are large and pink and first occur after three years after planting. The bark can be gray or brown. Leaves are compound, composed of five leaflets each. The fruits, long and slender capsules, are not edible. T. rose is not cultivated for food. Otherwise, it functions as a shade tree in coffee and cocoa plantations. Medicinally, it is used for anemia, constipation, fevers, pain, and tonsillitis. The wood is moderately light and soft but makes an excellent timber. It is ideal for heavy construction, furniture, cabinet making, interior finish, boat building, carts, etc. Propagation of this plant is by woody stem cuttings, seeds sowing, and air layering.","Tabebuia rosea is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

A decoction of the bark is recommended for anemia and constipation. A decoction of the flowers, leaves and roots has been used to reduce fevers and pain, cause sweating, to treat tonsil inflammation and various other disorders (Hernan Rodriguez Navas. 2007. La Utilidad de las Plantas Medicinales en Costa Rica. EUNA, Heredia, Costa Rica). Active phytochemicals in the tree include lapachol, a natural organic compound isolated from various other Tabebuia species.

Other Uses The wood is a rather dull greyish brown with a fine striping of deep brown, often in a conspicuous pattern on the tangential surface[331 ]. It is without distinctive odour or taste; the grain is usually straight, but sometimes roey or wavy; the texture medium. The wood is moderately light and soft to rather hard and heavy; fairly durable. It is easy to work, finishes smoothly, seasons without difficulty. It is said that if the wood is cut green and stacked to dry, it acquires a dark colour, without losing its striping, and is then of different appearance from wood treated in the more usual manner[331 ]. An excellent timber, it is used for a great variety of purposes such as heavy construction; furniture and cabinetwork; interior finish; boat building; carts, and many other kinds of work[331 ]. A large part of the cheaper chairs of Central America are made from this wood[331 ].",,"A plant of the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations from 100 - 1,200 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 30c, but can tolerate 17 - 34c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,250 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Succeeds in most soils that are fertile[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[418 ]. Requires a somewhat sheltered position because branches are easily broken by strong winds[303 , 418 ]. This species can sometimes be invasive[307 ]. Trees can commence flowering when only 3 years old from seed[362 ]. Annual wood production potential is 10 - 20 metric tonnes per hectare[418 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer(early spring, mid spring, late spring). Bloom Color: Pale Pink Violet/Lavender White/Near White(red, pink, white). Spacing: 30-40 ft. (9-12 m).",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200 ]. Germination usually takes place in 3 - 4 days[362 ]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood[200 ].
