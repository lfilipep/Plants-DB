24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil and a sunny position[111] but tolerating partial shade[88]. Plants flower less freely in a shady position though the flowers can last longer in such a position[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[200]. They increase by means of runners[205] and form loose spreading clumps[K]. The roots are not swollen[233]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200]. The fragrant flowers are very short-lived, they open in the late afternoon and die in the morning[200, 205]. However, plants produce a succession of flowers for several weeks of the summer, each scape carrying between 4 and 20 blooms[205].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
