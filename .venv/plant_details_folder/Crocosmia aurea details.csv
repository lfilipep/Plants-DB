13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Crocosmia aurea is a CORM growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in almost all soils other than very heavy clays or bogs[233], though it prefers a light rich sandy soil[1, 79] in full sun or light dappled shade[200, 233]. Another report says that it prefers a fairly shady position and plenty of moisture in the growing season[79]. The corms are hardy to about -10°c[200] but in cold areas it is wise to lift them when the plants die down in the autumn, store them in a cool frost-free place over the winter and plant them out in the spring[1]. Make sure the corms do not dry out[1]. It is best to avoid lifting the corms if at all possible since the new corms seem to derive some nutrition from the old corms that have flowered[200]. Plants can divide quite freely when growing in a suitable location[233]. Although the fresh flowers have no perfume, when dried and immersed in warm water they release a scent like that of the saffron crocus[245]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold greenhouse[1]. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 9 weeks at 20 - 25°c[164]. Stored seed can be sown in early spring in a greenhouse[164]. Sow the seed thinly so that the plants can be grown on undisturbed in their pot for the first year, but give the seedlings an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. Once the plants are dormant in the autumn, pot up the bulbs putting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another year or two in the greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant in the autumn. Division in spring as new growth commences[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",
