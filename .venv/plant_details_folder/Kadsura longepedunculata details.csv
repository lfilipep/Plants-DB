24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sheltered position in a moderately fertile well-drained neutral to acid soil200]. Prefers a position in semi-shade[219]. Flowers are produced on the current year's growth[219]. Plants do not really require pruning[219]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruit is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown when it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in early summer and give some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Overwinter in the greenhouse and plant out in late spring[11, 78]. Good percentage[78]. Layering of long shoots in the autumn[200]."
