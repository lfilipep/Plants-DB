The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sheltered position in a moderately fertile well-drained neutral to acid soil200]. Prefers a position in semi-shade[219]. Flowers are produced on the current year's growth[219]. Plants do not really require pruning[219]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruit is required.","Seed - best sown when it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in early summer and give some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Overwinter in the greenhouse and plant out in late spring[11, 78]. Good percentage[78]. Layering of long shoots in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
