25,Cultivation Details Description,"A submerged aquatic plant that can be used as an oxygenator of ponds[1]. It is best given a loam based medium in full sun[200]. A polymorphic species[17]. A fast growing plant in need of constant checking to make sure it does not overrun the pond[200]. It provides a very good food source for ducks and other water fowl[212]. Plants do not flower every year[212]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, the resulting progeny is usually sterile[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a pot that is standing in its own depth of water in a greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if this is possible. Stored seed is likely to have a short viability. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and increase the depth of water around the pot until the plants are covered by a few centimetres of water. Grow the plants on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter, increasing the depth of water as the plants grow larger. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring[56]. Cuttings of erect shoots in the growing season[56]."
