13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Quercus stellata is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft 7in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked[61, 63, 105]. A sweet taste[159]. The seed is up to 25mm long and 18mm wide[82, 200], it can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a thickening in stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread. The seed from some trees might contain bitter tannins, these can be leached out by thoroughly washing the seed in running water though many minerals will also be lost. Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground overwinter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[177, 257]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiaphonic: Restores the voice.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiaphonic  Astringent  Disinfectant  Dysentery  Emetic  Febrifuge  TonicThe bark is astringent, disinfectant, emetic, febrifuge and tonic[257]. An infusion is used in the treatment of chronic dysentery, indigestion, asthma, lost voice and intermittent fevers[257]. The bark can be chewed to treat mouth sores[257]. An infusion of the bark can be used as a wash on sore and chapped skin[257]. Any galls produced on the tree are strongly astringent and can be used in the treatment of haemorrhages, chronic diarrhoea, dysentery etc[4]."
22,Other Uses,"Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A mulch of the leaves repels slugs, grubs etc, though fresh leaves should not be used as these can inhibit plant growth[20]. Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin, that can also be used as a dyestuff[4].  - very heavy, hard, close grained, very durable in contact with the soil but difficult to cure. It weighs about 52lb per cubic foot. It is largely used for fencing, lumber, furniture and fuel[46, 61, 82, 149, 159, 171, 227]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good deep fertile loam which can be on the stiff side[1, 11]. Young plants tolerate reasonable levels of side shade[200]. Tolerates moderate exposure, surviving well but being somewhat stunted[200]. Prefers warmer summers than are usually experienced in Britain, trees often grow poorly in this country and fail to properly ripen their wood resulting in frost damage overwinter[200]. A slow-growing drought resistant tree, it takes 20 - 30 years before it produces seed[229]. It then usually produces a good crop of seeds every 2 - 4 years[229]. The tree flowers on new growth produced in spring, the seed ripening in its first year[200, 229]. Intolerant of root disturbance, trees should be planted in their permanent positions whilst young[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it quickly loses viability if it is allowed to dry out. It can be stored moist and cool overwinter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees[11]. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being moved or they will transplant very badly."
