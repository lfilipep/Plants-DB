It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105]. Best used after it has been exposed to frost[177, 183], since this will soften and sweeten the flesh[K]. The fruit is about 25mm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is said to induce earlier bearing[160]. The wood of this species is hard and close-grained, and is sometimes used for making furniture and stools[266].",,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Firewood, Screen, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Grows well on acid soils[160]. Plants are hardy to about -40°c when they are fully dormant[160]. There are many named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The cultivar 'Bradford' is resistant to fireblight[188]. Resists fireblight, collar rot, root aphis, pear psylla and root lesion nematodes[160]. Trees have a short dormancy period and lose their leaves late in the season[160]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
