24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil[1]. Succeeds in most soils so long as they do not dry out[200]. Dislikes drought[1]. Prefers a position sheltered from cold north and east winds[1]. Plants are liable to injury by winter cold[11]. They are hardy to about -20°c according to another report[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. A few stems on each plant usually produce flowers in most years without noticeable harm to the plant[11]. Plants spread rapidly by means of underground suckers and are apt to be invasive, especially when they are well established[11, 200]. New canes are produced from late April."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings."
