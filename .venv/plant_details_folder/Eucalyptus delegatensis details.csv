4,Known Hazards,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269]."
5,Habitats,"Often a shelf species in hilly areas, growing on southern and eastern aspects where there is air drainage to lower frost hollows, frequently dominant in areas suited to it; at elevations usually from 300 - 1,500 metres, but to sea level in Tasmania[1658]."

18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Eucalyptus leaves are a traditional Aboriginal herbal remedy. The essential oil found in the leaves is a powerful antiseptic and is used all over the world for relieving coughs and colds, sore throats and other infections[254]. The essential oil is a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold remedies[254]. The plant is an aromatic, astringent, tonic herb that sticks to the teeth and turns the saliva red[238]. The report says that the leaves, essential oil and oleo-resin are used[238], but does not specify which properties apply to the different parts of the plant[K]. The leaves and the oil will have very similar properties, the oil being much stronger in its effect since it is distilled from the leaves[K]. Detailed below is how the oleo-resin and oil are commonly used in other species[K]. The essential oil obtained from various species of eucalyptus is a very powerful antiseptic, especially when it is old, because ozone is formed in it on exposure to air. It has a decided disinfectant action, destroying the lower forms of life[4]. The oil can be used externally, applied to cuts, skin infections etc, it can also be inhaled for treating blocked nasal passages, it can be gargled for sore throat and can also be taken internally for a wide range of complaints[4]. Some caution is advised, however, because like all essential oils, it can have a deleterious effect on the body in larger doses[4]. An oleo- resin is exuded from the tree[238]. It can also be obtained from the tree by making incisions in the trunk[4, 152]. This resin contains tannin and is powerfully astringent, it is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and bladder inflammation[4, 152, 238], externally it is applied to cuts etc[4, 152]. Treats throat ailments[156]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the leaves. Total quantity of the oil, and its composition, can vary widely from plant to plant, but we have reports that the fresh leaves contain around 1.8 - 3.9% (2.5 - 5.6% dry weight) essential oil. The main components include phellandrene, cymene, pperitone, methyl cinnamate and eudesmol[1659 ]. The heartwood is pale brown, straw-coloured or pinkish; the 30mm thick band of sapwood is almost white. The wood is open-textured, straight-grained, with conspicuous growth rings. It bends fairly well, is easily worked and polishes well. An excellent timber, it is widely in construction, for purposes such as building framing, flooring, plywood and veneers, furniture, panelling, turnery, handles and pulp for hardboard and paper[1097 , 1658 ]. Eucalypts are culturally important to the Indigenous Australians for a great variety of uses and meanings (Neyland, M. 2010. Eucalyptus delegatensis Forests)."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Eucalyptus delegatensis is native to the temperate climate of southeastern Australia, where it is found at elevations up to 1,500 metres. Summers are warm and can be dry, with most rainfall occurring in the winter months and a dry season that can be up to 3 months long. Mean annual rainfall is within the range 2,500 - 3,700mm, sometimes as snow; mean maximum of the hottest month is 21c; mean minimum of the coldest month is 0c, and there are generally around 70 - 100 frosts a year[1658 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -12c, but young growth is more tender and can be severely damaged at -1c[418 ]. Requires a sunny position, succeeding in a wide range of well-drained soils of high to moderate fertility[418 ]. The soils of the better forests in which it grows are moist but well-drained loams, especially those derived from granites or dolerites, but the mother rock may be a variety of sedimentary deposits in some places[1658 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7[418 ]. A quick-growing tree that is easy to regenerate[1658 ]. It responds well to coppicing[1212 ]. Eucalyptus delegatensis occurs at a higher elevation than any other important timber species in Australia. The natural occurrences of the species are likely to have snow on the ground for several weeks each year[1658 ]. Annual wood production potential is 10 - 25 cubic metres per hectare[418 ]. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions[200 ]. Many members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, and there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200 ]. The tree has good prospects for planting in cool areas with a fairly high winter rainfall. It is one of the eucalypts resistant to frosts at least as severe as 9c at the time of planting[1658 ]. It has beens introduced into South Africa in Zones E and G on a relatively small scale and showed good height and diameter growth, but did not become a preferred species. Several countries have good specimens but the main commercial plantations are in New Zealand. In New Zealand it is planted both in containers and as bare-rooted planting stock. With adequate root-pruning good seedlings are prepared and planted either by hand or by machine The trees grow vigorously but the leading shoot is attacked each autumn by the fungus Mycosphaerella nubilosa, which results in multiple leaders. One of these becomes the main stem early in the next growing season, but successive attacks of the fungus cause a series of large branches to develop on the trunk. This is not of great significance if the crop is being grown for pulpwood, but is more serious in the case of sawtimber[1658 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow late winter/early spring in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11 , 78 , 134 ]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2c[200 ]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in early summer, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200 ]."
