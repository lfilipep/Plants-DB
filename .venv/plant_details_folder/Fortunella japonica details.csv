17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - usually cooked and used in jellies, preserves etc[183] or used as a flavouring, but it can also be eaten raw. The whole fruit, including the peel, is eaten[3, 132]. The fruit is acid whilst the peel is sweet[3, 132]. The peel is golden-yellow, smooth, thinner and somewhat sweeter than the oval kumquat, F. margarita[183]. The fruit is rich in pectin and makes excellent marmalades and jellies[240]. Vitamin C content is up to 0.24 mg/cc[240]. The fruit is about 4cm long[260]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Deodorant: Masks smells. Is this medicinal?,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

23,Other Uses Description,The fresh leaves and young twigs yield 0.21% essential oil that might be suitable for perfumery[240].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moderately heavy loam with a generous amount of compost and sand added and a very sunny position[200]. Prefers a pH of 5 to 6[200]. Plants are intolerant of water logging[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, when dormant it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Kumquats are widely cultivated in China for their edible fruit, there are many named varieties[3]. The plant is less vigorous, somewhat thorny and considerably more cold tolerant[183] (the report gives no details of what this is in comparison to!). Kumquats are hardier than the various Citrus species since they cease growth when temperatures drop below 13°c but, for best results, it is best to grow them in a climate where temperatures do not fall lower than between 4 and 10°c[3]. This is because the fruit is sweeter when it ripens in warm conditions[3]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm airy position in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts and give some winter protection from the cold for a year or two."
