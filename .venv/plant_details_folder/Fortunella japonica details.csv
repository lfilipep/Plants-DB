See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Citrus japonica.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,"Fruit - usually cooked and used in jellies, preserves etc[183] or used as a flavouring, but it can also be eaten raw. The whole fruit, including the peel, is eaten[3, 132]. The fruit is acid whilst the peel is sweet[3, 132]. The peel is golden-yellow, smooth, thinner and somewhat sweeter than the oval kumquat, F. margarita[183]. The fruit is rich in pectin and makes excellent marmalades and jellies[240]. Vitamin C content is up to 0.24 mg/cc[240]. The fruit is about 4cm long[260].","Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Deodorant: Masks smells. Is this medicinal?,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiphlogistic  Antitussive  Antivinous  Carminative  Deodorant  Expectorant  Stimulant  Vitamin CThe plant is antiphlogistic, antivinous, carminative, deodorant, stimulant[178, 218]. The leaves and fruit contain an essential oil, whilst the fruit also contains sugars and organic acids[283]. The fresh fruit is antitussive and expectorant - in Vietnam it is steamed with sugar candy and used in the treatment of sore throats[283]. It is said to be very good for infants[283].","Deodorant: A pleasant smelling plant that is used on the body to mask the human smell.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Pectin: A substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.",The fresh leaves and young twigs yield 0.21% essential oil that might be suitable for perfumery[240].,,"Prefers a moderately heavy loam with a generous amount of compost and sand added and a very sunny position[200]. Prefers a pH of 5 to 6[200]. Plants are intolerant of water logging[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, when dormant it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Kumquats are widely cultivated in China for their edible fruit, there are many named varieties[3]. The plant is less vigorous, somewhat thorny and considerably more cold tolerant[183] (the report gives no details of what this is in comparison to!). Kumquats are hardier than the various Citrus species since they cease growth when temperatures drop below 13°c but, for best results, it is best to grow them in a climate where temperatures do not fall lower than between 4 and 10°c[3]. This is because the fruit is sweeter when it ripens in warm conditions[3].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm airy position in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts and give some winter protection from the cold for a year or two.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
