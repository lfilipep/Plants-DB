22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown for ground cover when planted about 45cm apart each way, they form spreading clumps[208]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant that succeeds in almost any soil[221], it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. If the plants are cut back by half after the first flush of flowering, they will usually produce a second flush[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Plants often self-sow in British gardens[221]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[208]. This species is very closely related to C. persicifolia, differing from that species in having stalkless flowers and stiff rather thick angular stems[271]. The main difference from a gardener's viewpoint is that this species is coarser and more robust with stems that rarely blow over[271]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. Easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring."
