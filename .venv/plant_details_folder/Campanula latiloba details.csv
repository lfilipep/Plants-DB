See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. grandis. Fisch.&C.A.Mey.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; Meadow;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[K]. Pleasantly sweet, though individual leaves are quite small. The leaves are available all year round. Flowers - a pleasant taste and texture with a slight sweetness[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Plants can be grown for ground cover when planted about 45cm apart each way, they form spreading clumps[208].",,"An easily grown plant that succeeds in almost any soil[221], it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. If the plants are cut back by half after the first flush of flowering, they will usually produce a second flush[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Plants often self-sow in British gardens[221]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[208]. This species is very closely related to C. persicifolia, differing from that species in having stalkless flowers and stiff rather thick angular stems[271]. The main difference from a gardener's viewpoint is that this species is coarser and more robust with stems that rarely blow over[271]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. Easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
