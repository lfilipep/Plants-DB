See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Flowers: ,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"Flowers - cooked[144]. Rich in pollen, they are often used in fritters. The plant yields an oily gum which is said to be edible[177, 183]. Some species produce a gum that is dark and is liable to be astringent and distasteful, but others produce a light gum and this is sweet and pleasant. It can be sucked like candy or soaked in water to make a jelly.[193]. The gum can be warmed when it becomes soft and chewable[193].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. The extensive root system of this plant helps to prevent soil erosion[200]. It is often planted for this purpose on sandy banks[167]. The bark is rich in tannin[1, 171]. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 40.8% tannin[223].",,"Prefers a rather poor sandy loam and a very sunny position[1, 11]. Succeeds in any good garden soil that is not excessively limey and in dry soils[11]. Most members of this genus become chlorotic on limey soils[200]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.8 to 6.5. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain. Plants require hot, sunny summers if they are to ripen their wood fully and flower freely. In Britain they tend to do best when grown in coastal gardens in a sunny, sheltered position that is protected from the wind[11]. A fast growing but short-lived tree in cultivation[167]. It is sometimes cultivated for the tannin obtained from its bark[1, 171]. This tree is the floral emblem of Australia[167]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.
