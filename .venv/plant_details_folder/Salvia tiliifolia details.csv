Not very hardy outdoors in Britain, it usually requires greenhouse protection in this country[1] but can be grown as an annual, flowering and seeding in its first year, if started in a greenhouse in the spring. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination should take place in about 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200].,
