13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Akebia x pentaphylla is a deciduous Climber growing to 9 m (29ft 6in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[200]. Sweet but insipid. The fruit has a delicate flavour and a soft juicy texture[K]. The flavour can be enhanced by the addition of a little lemon juice. Valued as a novelty, it looks somewhat like a deep-purple coloured sausage. The dried young leaves are a tea substitute."

22,Other Uses,Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.
23,Other Uses Description,"The peeled stems are very pliable. They can be bleached and used in basket making[46, 61]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[200]. Succeeds in acid or alkaline soils[200]. Prefers partial shade but succeeds in full sun[200]. Succeeds on a north facing wall[219]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -15°c but they can be somewhat tender when young and are best given some protection at this time[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Resentful of root disturbance, either grow plants in containers prior to planting them out or plant them out whilst very young[219]. A naturally occurring hybrid, A. quinata x A. trifoliata[200]. Plants are evergreen in mild winters[11, 200]. They are fast growing and can be invasive[200]. Plants are not normally pruned, if they are growing too large they can be cut back by trimming them with shears in early spring[202]. Shy to fruit, it possibly requires some protection in the flowering season - hand pollination is advisable. Plants are also possibly self-sterile. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Surface sow in a light position[133]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[133]. Stored seed should be given 1 month cold stratification[113, 133] and can be very difficult to germinate. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This is a hybrid species and so it will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. The cuttings can be slow to root[200]. Cuttings can also be taken of soft wood in spring[113]. Root cuttings, December in a warm greenhouse[113]. Layering in early spring[1]. Very easy, the plants usually self-layer and so all you need to do is dig up the new plants and plant them out directly into their permanent positions."
