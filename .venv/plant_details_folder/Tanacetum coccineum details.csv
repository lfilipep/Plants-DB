Pyrethrum roseum.,Meadow; Cultivated Beds;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Insecticide: Kills insects.,"The dried flower heads are used as an insecticide[46, 61, 114, 169, 171], they are a source of the commercially available insecticide 'pyrethrum', which is non-toxic to mammals[238]. This species is less effective than T. cinerariifolium[238]. Only the yellow disk rays contain pyrethrins[169]. Once dried, the flowers or the powder retain their insecticidal properties almost indefinitely[238].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden.

Another report says that it requires a sunny position in a well-drained alkaline or neutral soil[169]. Prefers a slightly acid sandy soil[187]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 7.

Only just cover the seed and do not allow the pot to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
