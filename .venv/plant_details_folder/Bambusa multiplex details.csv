18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[46, 105]. Bitter tasting, they are rarely eaten[195]. They are less bitter if harvested before they emerge from the soil and then parboiled in water[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.",
23,Other Uses Description,"is made from the culms[46, 61]. The canes are too arched for good poles and there is too small a volume for significant pulp production, in spite of good fibre dimensions[195]. The culms are up to 4cm in diameter[220]. The canes split easily and are fairly flexible - they are used as a source of weaving material for mats, baskets and other household goods[220, 272]. The plant makes a good screen or hedge[188, 200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Screen, Specimen. Prefers an open loam of fair quality, succeeding on peaty soils and in full sun or dappled shade[11, 200]. Requires a position sheltered from cold drying winds[11]. Requires abundant moisture in the growing season and plenty of organic matter in the soil[11]. A fairly hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -8°c[25, 195], but it does not like periods of prolonged cold. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. New shoots appear in late spring, the rootstock is caespitose[25]. A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[25, 195]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences[220]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Branches often develop into rhizomatous offsets with long roots. These can be removed and potted up in late spring[220].",
