It requires no further ripening and can store for several days to several months[183]. Occasionally eaten fresh, it is more commonly cooked in pies, preserves etc[183]. A sour taste[200]. The fruit is up to 8cm long and 5cm wide[200].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. This hybrid species has a greater resistance to fireblight than either of its parents though the fruit quality is poorer[183]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. This species is a hybrid and is unlikely to breed true to type from seed.",
