Succeeds in a good open soil but if it is to thrive it needs copious rainfall, high humidity and warmer conditions than are normally found in Britain[11, 200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[260]. They succeed outdoors in the mildest areas in the south and west of the country[1]. They are hardy in Cornwall, southern Ireland etc[11], where they succeed in woodland gardens[166]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in a sandy soil in a cool or slightly warm frame in spring."
