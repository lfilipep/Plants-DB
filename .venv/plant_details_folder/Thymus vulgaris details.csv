The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

It is an essential ingredient of the herb mix 'bouquet garni'[238]. It retains its flavour well in long slow cooking[200]. The leaves can be used either fresh or dried[183]. If the leaves are to be dried, the plants should be harvested in early and late summer just before the flowers open and the leaves should be dried quickly[200].

It is very rich in essential oils and these are the active ingredients responsible for most of the medicinal properties[218]. In particular, thyme is valued for its antiseptic and antioxidant properties, it is an excellent tonic and is used in treating respiratory diseases and a variety of other ailments[254]. The flowering tops are anthelmintic, strongly antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, deodorant, diaphoretic, disinfectant, expectorant, sedative and tonic[4, 7, 21, 200, 218]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of dry coughs, whooping cough, bronchitis, bronchial catarrh, asthma, laryngitis, indigestion, gastritis and diarrhoea and enuresis in children[238]. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238]. Externally, it is used in the treatment of tonsillitis, gum diseases, rheumatism, arthritis and fungal infections[238]. The plant can be used fresh at any time of the year, or it can be harvested as it comes into flower and either be distilled for the oil or dried for later use[238]. Thyme has an antioxidant effect, thus regular use of this herb improves the health and longevity of individual body cells and therefore prolongs the life of the body[254, K]. The essential oil is strongly antiseptic[4]. The whole herb is used in the treatment of digestive disorders, sore throats, fevers etc[4]. The essential oil is one of the most important oils used in aromatherapy[7, 210]. Its keyword is 'Bacterial'[210].

It has fungicidal properties[171] and is also used to prevent mildew[218]. The leaves are dried and used in pot-pourri[238]. The plant makes an attractive ground cover for a sunny position[201]. Plants are best spaced about 30cm apart each way[208]. The dried flowers are used to repel moths from clothing[4] whilst the growing plant is said to repel cabbage root fly[18, 20].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden. Prefers a light, dry calcareous soil and a sunny position[4, 7, 11, 27, 37]. Succeeds in dry soils, poor soils and tolerates drought once it is established[190]. Plants can be grown on old walls. Thymes dislike wet conditions, especially in the winter. A layer of gravel on the soil around them will help protect the foliage from wet soils[238]. Thyme is hardy to about -15°c[200], though it is even hardier when grown on old walls are in well-drained poor light soils[4]. Thyme is commonly grown in the herb garden, there are many named varieties[182]. It is also harvested commercially for its essential oil[218]. The leaves are very aromatic[190]. It is sometimes grown as an annual from seed when used for culinary purposes[200]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are very attractive to honey bees[4, 7, 200]. Thyme is a good companion for most plants[20, 54], it is said to repel cabbage root flies when grown near brassicas[18, 20]. This is a very difficult genus taxonomically, the species hybridize freely with each other and often intergrade into each other[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)

A clumping mat former. Forming a dense prostrate carpet with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed can also be sown in autumn in a greenhouse. Surface sow or barely cover the seed. Germination can be erratic. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can keep for three years in normal storage[4]. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
