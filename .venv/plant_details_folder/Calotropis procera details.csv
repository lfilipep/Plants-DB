13,Summary,"Auricula Tree or Calotropis procera is an erect, flowering shrub that grows up to 2-5 m tall. When fully established, it is drought-resistant and salt-tolerant. Its flowers are purple and white and the plant juice is poisonous. The stem is source of strong and durable fibre used in making ropes, bow strings, fishing nets, paper, pulp, etc. The seed capsules, on the other hand, are used as stuffing material in mattresses. The stems further produce good charcoal and is termite resistant. It is used for roofing and building hats. Mudar Gummi, a rubber material, is also obtained from Auricula tree. The broad, greyish-green leaves of auricula tree are used as a soup ingredient. It is used medicinally against asthma. Roots are poisonous and used for treating snakebites. The latex is used against ringworm and as laxative; the flower against asthma and catarrh. F"

The principal active compounds are asclepin and mudarin[ 303 ]. Other compounds have been found to have bactericidal and vermicidal propertie[ 303 ]. The root bark is an emetic[ 303 ]. An infusion of bark powder is used in the treatment and cure of leprosy and elephantiasis[ 46 , 266 , 303 ]. It is inadvisable to use bark that has been kept for more than a year[ 303 ]. The extremely poisonous roots are used in the treatment of snakebites[ 303 ]. The leaves are used for the treatment of asthma[ 266 ]. The milky sap is used as a rubefacient and is also strongly purgative and caustic[ 303 ]. The latex is used for treating ringworm, guinea worm blisters, scorpion stings, venereal sores and ophthalmic disorders[ 303 ], it is also used as a laxative[ 303 ]. Its use in India in the treatment of skin diseases has caused severe bullous dermatitis leading sometimes to hypertrophic scars[ 303 ]. The local effect of the latex on the conjunctiva is congestion, epiphora and local anaesthesia[ 303 ]. The latex contains a proteolytic enzyme called caloptropaine[ 303 ]. The flower is digestive and tonic[ 303 ]. It is used in the treatment of asthma and catarrh[ 303 ]. The twigs are applied for the preparation of diuretics, stomach tonic and anti-diarrhoetics and for asthma[ 303 ]. Also used in abortion, as an anthelmintic, for colic, cough, whooping cough, dysentery, headache, lice treatment, jaundice, sore gums and mouth, toothache, sterility, swellings and ulcers[ 303 ]."

23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: A source of green manure[ 303 ]. The plant can help improve soil water conditions and also acts as a soil binder[ 303 ]. Plants often escape from cultivation, especially when growing on sandy soils. It often self-sows freely on overgrazed land and has been used as an indicator of exhausted soil[ 303 ]. Other Uses A strong fibre is obtained from the stem[ 46 ]. Durable under water[ 46 ]. White, silky, strong, cylindrical, flexible and durable stem fibre used for various purposes, such as for making ropes, to form cheap cots, gunny bags, bow strings, fishing nets, and in the manufacture of paper, pulp and duplicating stencils[ 46 , 303 , 774 ]. Strong inner bark fibres produce a binding material and are processed into fabrics[ 303 ]. The floss from the seed capsules is used as a stuffing material in mattresses etc[ 46 , 774 ]. The floss from the seeds, which is about 2 - 3.5 cm long, white silky and strong, is used as an inferior stuffing for mattresses and pillows as well as for weaving into a strong cloth[ 303 ]. The floss may also substitute cotton wool for surgical purposes[ 303 ]. The plant is the source of a rubber-like product called Mudar Gummi[ 46 ]. The liquid latex can be used as a renewable source of hydrocarbons and intermediate energy resources[ 303 ]. The latex contains 11 - 23% of rubber[ 303 ]. The latex is 80% effective in inhibiting the activity of the tobacco mosaic virus[ 303 ]. The leafy branches are said to deter ants[ 303 ]. A macerated bark extract can be used for dyes[ 303 ] An ideal plant for monitoring sulphur dioxide emissions in the air[ 303 ]. The stems are termite proof and are used for roofing and building huts[ 303 ]. The very light wood can also be used for fishing net floats[ 303 ]. The wood is a source of charcoal, used for making gunpowder[ 46 , 303 ]. Stems produce a good charcoal, while the stem pith makes good tinder[ 303 ]. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed fiber or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the semi-arid tropics and subtropics, it is found growing at elevations from sea level to 1,300 metres[ 303 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual rainfall is in the range 300 - 400mm[ 303 ]. Requires a sunny position. Prefers disturbed sandy soils[ 303 ]. Established plants are very drought-resistant and are salt-tolerant to a relatively high degree[ 303 ]. It has a preference for and is often dominant in areas of abandoned cultivation especially sandy soils in areas of low rainfall[ 303 ]. When growing in sandy soils, this species has been known to escape from cultivation[ 307 ]. The plant has spread widely from its original range and has become naturalized in many areas of the tropics and subtropics[ 303 ]. Through its wind and animal dispersed seeds, it quickly becomes established as a weed along degraded roadsides, lagoon edges and in overgrazed native pastures[ 303 ]. When cultivated, annual yields of up to 500 kg/ha of fibre are expected. A single harvest per season is preferable to a double (or triple) harvest; a single harvest would result in a net saving of energy input both on the farm and in the processing plant[ 303 ]. The plant is often an indicator of overgrazed land[ 303 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. The tree seeds freely, and natural regeneration is common. Vegetative propagation through half stumps assumes a special importance as compared with the entire stumps because they help in faster multiplication of the parent genotype with plus characters, as each plant gives rise to 2 half stumps. Stumps also help in propagating only 1 plant. Vegetative propagation through stem and root cuttings is very useful in large-scale multiplication of the superior genotypes."
