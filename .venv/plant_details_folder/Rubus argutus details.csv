20,Medicinal Uses,"Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. This species is cultivated for its edible fruit in N. America[[142, 171]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]."
