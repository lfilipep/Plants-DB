It is deciduous, fast growing, and resistant to drought reaching a height of up to 12 m and trunk diameter of up to 45 cm upon maturity. It has an open crown of drooping branches and tripinatte leaves. The leaves are yellow-white, fragrant, and thinly veined. The fruit is a three-sided capsule, brown in color, and hanging. The seeds are globular, dark boring and have whitish papery wings. It can be dispersed by wind and water. The roots are shredded and used as a condiment. The leaves are the most nutritious plant part. It is often cooked and consumed as vegetable, or dried and crushed into a powder then added into soups and sauce. The seed pods are edible when immature but become inedible and bitter as it mature. The seeds can be eaten like peas or roasted. It yields edible oil known as ben oil which is clear and odorless. The flowers can also be eaten raw or cooked. Horseradish tree, in general, is diuretic, rubefacient, and laxative. It can be used to increase milk flow and control bacterial infections. It can also be used as treatment for asthma, gout, rheumatism, inflammation, bladder and kidney stones, boils, ulcers, wounds, skin diseases, snake bites, etc. Horseradish tree is also planted as windbreaks and to prevent soil erosion. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. The bark is used for tanning. The wood yields blue dye and used only for light constructions.","Moringa oleifera is a deciduous Tree growing to 8 m (26ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness.

Flowering tree. Coastal street tree. Specimen. Xerophytic.  Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be grown as an informal hedge[200 ], providing wind protection, shade and support for climbing garden plants[303 ]. Widely used for live fences and hedges in many areas[303 ]. Stakes root easily and are stable, and cuttings planted in lines are used particularly around houses and gardens[303 ]. Because its shade can be controlled well Moringa oleifera is suitable for planting in alley cropping and in vegetable gardens. When trees reach 1.5 metres, farmers prune them (at 50cm from the ground or at ground level for older ones) once or twice a year. In alley cropping, an intra-row spacing of 2 metres is used. In the wet season cereals are grown between the lines, in the dry season vegetables[299 ]. Because the tree is fast growing and readily colonizes areas such as stream banks and savannah, it makes a very good pioneer species for establishing a woodland garden. It is able to provide food after just a few months and also providing shelter to help other plants to establish[K ]. Other Uses The oil obtained from the mature seed and pods, known as 'oil of ben', has been used to lubricate watches and other fine machinery[63 , 238 , 287 , 303 ]. It is also used in perfumery, artist's paints, soaps and ointments[200 , 238 ]. It is yellowish, non-drying, has good keeping qualities but eventually turns rancid[303 ]. The powdered seeds are used to clarify sugar cane juice[303 ]. A suspension of the ground seed is used as a primary coagulant[299 , 303 ]. It can clarify water of any degree of visible turbidity. At high turbidity, its action is almost as fast as that of alum, but at medium and low turbidity, good clarification is obtained if a small cloth bag filled with the powdered seeds is swirled round in the turbid water[303 ]. To prepare the seed for use as a coagulant, remove the seed coat and wings. The white kernel is then crushed to a powder, using a mortar or placing it in a cloth and crushing it with a stone. The powder should be mixed with a small amount of water, stirred, then poured through a tea strainer before being added to the turbid water[303 ]. The seed cake residue from oil extraction can also be used for water purification[299 ]. The seed contains a protein (cationic polyelectrolyte) that acts as a flocculant in water purification. It also contains a non-protein flocculant that is more effective in purifying low-turbidity water[299 ]. The bark, when beaten, produces a fibre used to make small ropes and mats. A study on the production of rayon-grade pulp from M. Oleifera by a prehydrolyzed sulphate process in India shows that it is suitable as a raw material for the production of high alpha cellulose pulp for use in cellophane and textiles[303 ]. When the tree is injured, the stem exudes a gum that is used in calico printing[303 ]. The bark is used for tanning[238 , 303 ]. The wood yields a blue dye[299 , 303 ]. The crushed leaves are used to clean pots, pans and walls[303 ]. The press cake left after oil extraction from the seeds can be used as a soil conditioner or as fertilizer[303 ]. The wood is very soft, corky and light, and is useful only for light construction work[303 , 404 ]. It is pulped as a source of rayon and cellophane[238 ]. The soft and light wood burns smoke-free and is an acceptable firewood for cooking but makes poor charcoal[299 , 303 ]. It has a density of 0.5-0.7 and yields approximately 4600 kcal/kg[303 ].","Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 35°c, but can tolerate 7 - 48°c[418 ]. The plant is quite cold hardy and is not harmed by light frosts, but it can be killed back to ground level by a freeze. It quickly sends out new growth from the trunk when cut, or from the ground when frozen[303 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 700 - 2,200mm, but tolerates 400 - 2,600mm[418 ]. Easily grown in a well-drained soil in a sunny position, tolerating a wide range of soil types[200 , 307 ]. It grows best on fertile and well drained sandy soil, clay or clay loam but is in general suitable for light, medium and heavy soils thoigh it will not withstand salinity. It has a special tolerance to shallow soil and is tolerant of low fertility[404 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 5 - 8.5[418 ]. Established plants are quite drought tolerant but yield much less foliage when continuously under water stress[303 ]. Grows better if given shelter from strong winds[418 ]. Moringa is an extremely fast-growing tree, and within 1- 3 months trees can reach 2.5 metres in height[303 ]. Growth rates of 3 - 4 metres per year is not unusual for young plants[299 ] Young trees raised from seed start flowering after 2 years. In trees grown from cuttings the first fruits may be expected 6 - 12 months after planting[299 ]. Flowering often precedes or coincides with the formation of new leaves, and can occur throughout the year in non-seasonal climates[299 ]. Constant pruning of up to 1.5 metres per year is suggested to obtain a thick-limbed and multibranched shrub[303 ]. It coppices and pollards well[303 ]. The sweet smelling flowers are produced throughout the year[404 ]. In the warmer parts of its range the plant can produce a second crop of seeds each year[418 ]. There is at least one named variety[301 ]. Flowering Time: Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: 8-10 ft. (2.4-3 m).","Seed - can be sown either directly, in containers or in a nursery seedbed, preferably with around 50% shade. No seed pre-treatment is required and seeds sprout readily in 1 - 2 weeks. Plants can be ready for planting out within 3 months of germination. Plants raised from seed produce fruit of unpredictable quality[299 , 303 ]. Germination rates for fresh seeds are around 80%, going down to about 50% after 12 months storage, but no seeds survive 2 years of storage[299 ]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood[200 ]. Easy[303 ]. Stem cuttings are usually preferred because they root easily[303 ]. Large limbs can be planted to make an instant living fence[307 ]. Branches 100 - 150cm in length, with a diameter of up to 4cm will root readily in just a few months[299 ]. Shield budding is successful, and budded trees begin to bear in 6 months and continue to give a good crop for 13 years[303 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
