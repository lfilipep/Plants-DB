21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Appetizer  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Stimulant  Stomachic  Tonic  UrinaryAngelica has a long folk-history of use as a medicinal herb, in particular for the treatment of digestive disorders and problems with blood circulation[4, 254]. The root is the most active medicinally, it should be harvested in the autumn of its first year of growth, sliced longitudinally if necessary and dried quickly[4]. If well stored, the root retains its medicinal virtues for many years[4]. The leaves and seeds can also be used[4]. The leaves are harvested and dried in late spring before the plant comes into flower[244]. The plant is antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant, stomachic, tonic[4, 9, 14, 21, 46, 165]. An infusion is used to ease flatulence, indigestion, chronic bronchitis and typhus[244]. It stimulates blood flow to the peripheral parts of the body and so is of value in treating poor circulation - it is considered a specific treatment for Buerger's disease, a condition that narrows the arteries of the hands and feet[254]. Angelica is contra-indicated for people with a tendency towards diabetes since its use can increase sugar levels in the urine[4]. This plant should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238], nor should the juice be allowed to come into contact with the eyes[244]. An essential oil from the seeds is sometimes used as a rub to relieve rheumatic conditions[244]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Angelica archangelica fruit for fevers and colds, infection of the urinary tract, dyspeptic complaints and loss of appetite. The root has been approved for dyspeptic complaints and loss of appetite.  (see [302] for critics of commission E). No health hazards or side-effects if the proper administration of therapeutic dosages. Avoid sunbathing and intensive UV radiation for the duration of a treatment [301]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil from the root and seeds is used in perfumery, medicinally and as a food flavouring[4, 46, 57, 100]. The oil from the seeds has a musk-like aroma and is often used to flavour liqueurs[245]. The dried root contains 0.35% essential oil, the seed about 1.3%[240]. Yields of the essential oil vary according to location, plants growing at higher altitudes have higher yields with a better aroma[240]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[52, 200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.5 to 7.3. A very hardy plant, tolerating severe frosts without damage[4]. Although by nature biennial, the plants are reliably perennial if they are prevented from setting seed[200]. Angelica is occasionally cultivated in the herb garden, mainly for its culinary uses[46]. The plants have a pervading aromatic odour[4]. The growing plant is almost untroubled by pests and diseases[4]. It attracts bees and hoverflies to the garden, helping to create a natural balance of insect pests and predators[24]. When well-sited, the plant will often self-sow - sometimes to the point of nuisance[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in situ as soon as it is ripe."
