18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[105, 144, 146, 158, 177]. About the size of a pea, it is insipidly sweet when fully ripe[2, 183]. The fruit is about 4mm in diameter[200]. The unripe fruit is sometimes used as a pickle[2, 183]."

23,Other Uses Description,"- light, tough, soft and easily worked. Used for carrying poles[46, 61, 158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained sandy loam in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates calcareous soils[200]. Requires a sheltered position[200]. Plants are shade tolerant in continental climates but they require more sun in maritime areas in order to ripen the wood[200]. Rich fertile soils encourage soft sappy growth which is then more susceptible to winter damage[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A tree at Kew was 6 metres tall in 1989[K]. This species is much confused with E. ovalifolia[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Sow stored seed in late winter or early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame."
