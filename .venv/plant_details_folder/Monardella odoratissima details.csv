24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained sandy soil[1, 200]. Requires a sunny position[200]. Strongly resents excessively cold damp soils in the winter[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A very polymorphic species, there are many sub-species[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring. Large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of semi-ripe shoots, July in a frame[200]."
