21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Rubefacient  Stimulant  Stomachic  VesicantHorse mint was traditionally taken by several native North American Indian tribes to treat nausea and vomiting, and to encourage perspiration during colds. It was also applied externally as a poultice to treat swellings and rheumatic pains[254]. Nowadays it is used primarily to treat digestive and upper respiratory tract problems[254]. The leaves are carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, rubefacient, stimulant, stomachic and vesicant[4, 61, 238]. An infusion of the leaves is used in the treatment of flatulence, nausea, indigestion, catarrh in the upper respiratory tract, and to induce sweating and promote urination[4, 254]. The herb is principally used externally as a rubefacient, applied as a poultice it helps to lessen the pain of arthritic joints by increasing the flow of blood in the area and thereby hastening the flushing out of toxins[4, 254]. The leaves can be harvested before the plant flowers, or they can be harvested with the flowering stems. They can be used fresh or dried[238]. The plant is a rich source of the medicinal essential oil 'thymol', which is antiseptic[4, 213, 222]. The plant has been commercially cultivated for its essential oil, though this is now produced synthetically[222]. Thymol is also an effective hookworm remedy, but must be ingested in such large quantities that it can prove fatal to the patient[213].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.",
23,Other Uses Description,The plant has a pleasing aroma and has been hung in the house as an incense[257].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in ordinary garden soil so long as it is not too dry[1, 200]. Requires a moist soil and a sunny position[200]. This species prefers a light dry alkaline soil[238]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[260] and should succeed outdoors in most parts of Britain. A polymorphic species[200]. A good bee plant[200]. Subject to mildew in dry summers[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow mid to late spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 10 - 40 days at 20°c. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. The seed can also be sown in situ in late summer in areas where the winters are not too severe and will produce larger plants. Cuttings of soft basal shoots in spring. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
