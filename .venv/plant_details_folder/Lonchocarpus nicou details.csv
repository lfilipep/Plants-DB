21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plants are grown in small gardens or fields, often in crop mixtures with cassava, beans or corn[317 ]. Other Uses The roots contain 0.75 - 1% rotenone, which can be used as an insecticide[46 ]. The rotenone content of the roots (ranging from 5 - 15%, with some clones yielding 20%) is greater than that of the related Lonchocarpus urucu (which ranges from 4 - 11%). This, however, is somewhat balanced by the fact that the overall yield of roots is higher for Lonchocrpus urucu[317 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist tropics where it is found at elevations from near sea level to 1,340 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 - 32°c, but can tolerate 15 - 41°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,300 - 2,700mm, but tolerates 2,000 - 3,100mm, and is found in areas with all year round rainfall and also where there is a distinct dry season[418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in dappled shade[418 ]. Young plants benefit from some shade, while older plants make more vigorous growth in full light[418 ]. Grows best in a medium soil that is rich in organic matter, but also succeeds in heavier soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, but can tolerate 5 - 7[418 ]. The first harvest of the stems can be made when the plants are 2 - 3 years old from cuttings[317 ]. The roots are usually harvested during the dry season[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby.",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - seldom produced by the plants[317 ]. Cuttings.,
