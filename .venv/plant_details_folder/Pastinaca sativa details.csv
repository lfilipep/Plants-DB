Parsnip is said to contain the alleged 'psychotroph' myristicine[218].","Roadsides and grassy waste places, especially on chalk and limestone[17].","Europe, including Britain, from Norway south and east to Spain, the Caucasus and Altai.",(4 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PastinacaSativa.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PastinacaSativa2.jpg",,"Pastinaca sativa is a BIENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Peucedanum sativum.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Root - raw or cooked[2, 4, 5, 9, 27, 183]. When well grown, the cooked root has a very tender texture, though it is rather chewy raw[K]. It is best harvested after there have been some autumn frosts because it will have developed a sweeter flavour[61]. The root is delicious baked, it can also be used in soups etc and can be added to cakes, pies and puddings[183]. Leaves and young shoots - cooked with other greens as a vegetable or added to soups etc[9, 183]. Used in early spring[9]. The seed is used as a condiment[9]. Similar in taste to dill[183].","Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Poultice  Women's complaintsA tea made from the roots has been used in the treatment of women's complaints[222]. A poultice of the roots has been applied to inflammations and sores[222]. The root contains xanthotoxin, which is used in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo[222]. Xanthotoxin is the substance that causes photosensitivity (see note above on toxicity)[222].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The leaves and roots are used to make an insect spray[20]. Roughly chop the leaves and roots, put them in a basin with enough water to cover, leave them overnight then strain and use as an insecticide against aphids and red spider mite[201].",,"Succeeds in most ordinary well-drained soils[16]. Requires an open situation[37]. Prefers a deep rich soil that is not too stiff[1]. The parsnip is often cultivated in the temperate zone for its edible root, there are a number of named varieties[46, 183, 200]. Normally cultivated as a winter root crop, some cultivars are faster to mature and can be available in late summer[200]. The roots are very frost hardy and can be left in the ground to be harvested as required, though they can also be lifted in the autumn and stored for a few months[200]. The flowers are very attractive to hover flies and predatory wasps[201]. Plants have very few insect pests, though they are sometimes attacked by carrot root fly[201]. Growing onions with the parsnips can reduce the damage[201]. Roots of the wild form can quite quickly be increased in size by selective breeding and good cultivation, it is possible to obtain good sized roots in only 6 years. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow from late winter to late spring in situ. Seed can be slow to germinate, especially from the earlier sowings[200], it is best to mark the rows by sowing a few radishes with the parsnips. The seed has a short viability, very few will still be viable 15 months after harvesting[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
