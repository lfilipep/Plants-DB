17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ",
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 4, 5, 9, 27, 183]. When well grown, the cooked root has a very tender texture, though it is rather chewy raw[K]. It is best harvested after there have been some autumn frosts because it will have developed a sweeter flavour[61]. The root is delicious baked, it can also be used in soups etc and can be added to cakes, pies and puddings[183]. Leaves and young shoots - cooked with other greens as a vegetable or added to soups etc[9, 183]. Used in early spring[9]. The seed is used as a condiment[9]. Similar in taste to dill[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Poultice  Women's complaintsA tea made from the roots has been used in the treatment of women's complaints[222]. A poultice of the roots has been applied to inflammations and sores[222]. The root contains xanthotoxin, which is used in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo[222]. Xanthotoxin is the substance that causes photosensitivity (see note above on toxicity)[222].",
22,Other Uses,"Insecticide: Kills insects.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves and roots are used to make an insect spray[20]. Roughly chop the leaves and roots, put them in a basin with enough water to cover, leave them overnight then strain and use as an insecticide against aphids and red spider mite[201].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most ordinary well-drained soils[16]. Requires an open situation[37]. Prefers a deep rich soil that is not too stiff[1]. The parsnip is often cultivated in the temperate zone for its edible root, there are a number of named varieties[46, 183, 200]. Normally cultivated as a winter root crop, some cultivars are faster to mature and can be available in late summer[200]. The roots are very frost hardy and can be left in the ground to be harvested as required, though they can also be lifted in the autumn and stored for a few months[200]. The flowers are very attractive to hover flies and predatory wasps[201]. Plants have very few insect pests, though they are sometimes attacked by carrot root fly[201]. Growing onions with the parsnips can reduce the damage[201]. Roots of the wild form can quite quickly be increased in size by selective breeding and good cultivation, it is possible to obtain good sized roots in only 6 years. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow from late winter to late spring in situ. Seed can be slow to germinate, especially from the earlier sowings[200], it is best to mark the rows by sowing a few radishes with the parsnips. The seed has a short viability, very few will still be viable 15 months after harvesting[200].",
