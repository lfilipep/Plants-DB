22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Pest tolerant, Hedge, Screen, Superior hedge, Specimen. Prefers a good loamy soil[1], but succeeds in any soil, including chalk, in sun or part shade[11, 184]. Dislikes unduly exposed conditions but succeeds in windier conditions than most other members of this genus[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[184], but plants are sometimes affected by severe prolonged frosts[1]. The form 'Purpureus' is said to be the hardiest variety[184]. Plants are very tolerant of being transplanted, moving well even when quite large[182]. The flowers are deliciously scented but plants only occasionally fruit in Britain[182]. If plants are clipped after flowering they will flower more freely each year[200]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a coldframe[200]. Stored seed probably germinates best if it is given 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification before sowing[113]. The seed usually takes 6 - 18 months to germinate, it should be pricked out into individual pots when it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in the greenhouse and plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood taken at the end of July, in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. A good percentage. Plant out in the spring 18 months later[78]. Layering in spring[200] or autumn[78]. Partially sever the layer leads in the following late summer and plant out in the autumn. High percentage[78]."
