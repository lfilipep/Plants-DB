24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of subtropical to tropical regions where it can usually be found at elevations from 500 - 2,000 metres, exceptionally to 3,000 metres. The mean annual temperature in its natural habitat ranges from 12° - 21°c; it experiences an absolute maximum shade temperature of 38 - 46c and an absolute minimum of -1° - +9°c[ 652 ]. Severe frost kills the leaves of seedlings and saplings, but they can recover during the growing season[ 303 ]. It grows in areas with a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 5,000mm[ 303 , 652 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[ 200 , 652 ]. Prefers a fertile, moisture-retentive but well-drained, sandy, loamy or gravelly soil[ 200 , 303 ]. The tree actually flowers best when growing on drier soils[ 303 ]. The plant is commonly cultivated in the tropics, where it sometimes escapes from cultivation. There are reports that it can become established in some areas and has been reported as 'invasive' in some Pacific Islands[ 305 ]. The growth of young plants is very rapid under favourable conditions. They have been known to attain heights of 3 metres within 12 months and to be almost 5 metres tall and flowering by the end of their second year[ 652 ]. The pods develop quickly, some attaining a good length whilst the tree is still in flower[ 652 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[ 755 ]. Production: It begins flowering at an early age."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it germinates readily, with up to 100% germinating after 14 months storage[ 652 ]. Sow in a nursery seedbed in light shade. Germination is very rapid, with seedlings appearing within 4 - 10 days[ 652 ]. Seedlings grow rapidly and, under good conditions, can be more than 1 metre tall within 2 months of germinating[ 652 ]. The seedlings are somewhat difficult to transplant and so are best moved to their permanent positions whilst still small. If larger plants are moved then they should be pruned back to allow easier establishment[ 652 ]. Layering Cuttings of half-ripe wood."
