3,USDA hardiness,5-9
4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]."
5,Habitats,Thickets in hills and low mountains all over Japan[58]. In China it is found on the sides of ditches and roadways as well as in rocky crevices where it is damp and shady[147].

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moderately loose soil, do not firm the soil any more than is necessary[1]. Tolerates a little direct sun but it grows better in the shade[200]. Grows well in a woodland garden[166]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7 but this is not critical[200]. Dislikes too much winter moisture[1]. A very ornamental and hardy plant[1], tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Spores - best sown as soon as ripe on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and keep humid until they are well established. Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position. Division in spring or summer[188]."
