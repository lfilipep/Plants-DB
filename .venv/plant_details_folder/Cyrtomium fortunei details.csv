0,Cyrtomium fortunei,Asian netvein hollyfern,Dryopteridaceae,5-9,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].",Thickets in hills and low mountains all over Japan[58].

Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164].

Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position.
