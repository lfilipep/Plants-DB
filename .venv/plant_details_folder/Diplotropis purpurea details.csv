It can grow up to 30 m in height. It is harvested from the wild for local use and export for its timber. It is one of the strongest and most beautiful woods. The wood is very hard, heavy, strong and moderately resistant to decay but is difficult to work.","Diplotropis purpurea is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Bowdichia brasiliensis (Tul.) Ducke Bowdichia guianensis (Tul.) Ducke Dibrachion guianense Tul.

The grain is straight to slightly interlocked or sometimes slightly wavy; the texture is coarse to very coarse; the lustre is high and golden in the proper light, often with a waxy appearance; no distinctive odour or taste is present[ 378 ]. The wood is very hard, heavy, tough, strong and generally considered to be moderately resistant to decay, although tests at Yale University indicate the wood is very durable in resistance to both white-rot and brown-rot fungus[ 378 ]. The wood is moderately difficult to work; it saws rather easily, but is somewhat difficult to plane because of its frequently roey grain, which when present requires considerable sanding; it turns well; has high screw-holding power; and takes wax or polish satisfactorily if a filler is first applied[ 378 ]. It is used for heavy construction, boatbuilding, house framing, flooring, furniture, and turnery. The timber's recognized beauty should promote its extensive use for furniture, cabinetwork, marine construction in non-teredo waters, and other similar uses in the countries of origin and on the export market. Its very good strength properties also suggest its use for tool handles and agricultural tools and vehicles[ 378 ].",,Succeeds in full sun to dappled shade[ 420 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil[ 420 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 420 ]. Newly planted young trees usually grow away moderately quickly[ 420 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a lightly shaded position in a nursery seedbed[ 420 ]. Germination rates are usually high, with the seed sprouting within 14 - 21 days[ 420 ]. Prick out the seedlings into individual containers when they are 4 - 5cm tall and they should be ready to plant out 5 - 6 months later[ 420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
