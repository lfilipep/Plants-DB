It is used in Korea to treat diarrhoea[279].,,None known,,"We have very little information on the cultivation requirements of this plant, though judging by its habitat and range it is probably hardy throughout Britain. The following notes are for the closely related P. bistorta and probably also apply to this species[K]. Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1] but prefers a moisture retentive not too fertile soil in sun or part shade[200]. The plant repays generous treatment[1]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -25°c[187]. Plants are somewhat spreading, forming quite extensive colonies[187] especially in low-lying pastures[4]. They seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually free and easy. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have reached sufficient size. If not, overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out the following spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
