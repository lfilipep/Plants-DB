4,Known Hazards,"There is a lot of disagreement over whether or not the leaves or fruit of this plant are poisonous. Views vary from relatively poisonous to perfectly safe to eat. The plant is cultivated as a food crop, both for its fruit and its leaves, in some parts of the world and it is probably true to say that toxicity can vary considerably according to where the plant is grown and the cultivar that is being grown[4, 7, 10, 13, 65, 76]. The unripe fruit contains the highest concentration of toxins[65]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Dislikes shade[1]. Caterpillars and slugs are particularly fond of this plant and can totally destroy it[K]. This is a cultivated form of S. nigrum, grown for its edible fruit. There is at least one named form[183]. See notes about possible toxicity at the top of this page. There is some disagreement among taxonomists as to the correct name of this plant. It is also listed as S. melanocerasum[200]. Grows well with clover[18]. Does not grow well with wormwood or white mustard and, when these plants are growing Closely related to S. nigra, they increase its content of toxic alkaloids[18]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ. The seed can also be sown in a greenhouse during the spring if required since this will normally produce larger crops of fruit. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant out in late spring.
