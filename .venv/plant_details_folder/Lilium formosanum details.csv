See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",L. longiflorum formosanum. L. philippinense formosanum.

Rich in starch, it can be used as a vegetable in similar ways to potatoes (Solanum tuberosum).",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Prefers an open free-draining humus-rich loamy soil with its roots in the shade and its head in the sun[200]. This species only tolerates temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. It is not fully hardy outside the mildest parts of Britain and is best grown as an annual or biennial in a cool greenhouse where it can flower in the first year from seed[143, 260]. In a warm climate the plant grows continually and will grow happily in pots in a conservatory[260]. The bulbs can be crammed into the pot with crocks below to give good drainage and a good loose compost above[260]. The form 'Price's var.' is an alpine form of the species, it breeds true from seed and it is hardy if grown in a sheltered spot in the rock garden[143]. The flowers diffuse a delicious sweet perfume[245]. Stem rooting, the bulbs should be planted 20cm deep[143]. Early to mid autumn is the best time to plant out the bulbs in cool temperate areas, in warmer areas they can be planted out as late as late autumn[143]. The plant should be protected against rabbits and slugs in early spring. If the shoot tip is eaten out the bulb will not grow in that year and will lose vigour[200].","Seed - immediate epigeal germination[130]. Sow thinly in pots from late winter to early spring in a cold frame. Should germinate in 2 - 4 weeks[163]. Great care should be taken in pricking out the young seedlings, many people prefer to leave them in the seed pot until they die down at the end of their second years growth. This necessitates sowing the seed thinly and using a reasonably fertile sowing medium. The plants will also require regular feeding when in growth. This species can flower within a year from seed, especially if sown in the early autumn[143]. Division with care in the autumn once the leaves have died down. Replant immediately[200]. Bulb scales can be removed from the bulbs in early autumn. If they are kept in a warm dark place in a bag of moist peat, they will produce bulblets. These bulblets can be potted up and grown on in the greenhouse until they are large enough to plant out[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
