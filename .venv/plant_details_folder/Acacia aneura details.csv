Form: Rounded, Vase.","Acacia aneura is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.","wers - cooked[144]. Rich in pollen, they are often used in fritters[144]. The bark exudes an edible gum[183]. Some species produce a gum that is dark and is liable to be astringent and distasteful, but others produce a light gum and this is sweet and pleasant. It can be sucked like candy or soaked in water to make a jelly[193]. The gum can be warmed when it becomes soft and chewable[193]. Seed - cooked. It is dried, ground into a flour and used with cereals in making cakes etc[177, 183]. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain approx 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat[278]. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present[278]. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated which is a distinct health advantage although it presents storage problems as such fats readily oxidise[278]. The mean total carbohydrate content of 55.8 + 13.7% is lower than that of lentils, but higher than that of soybeans while the mean fibre content of 32.3 + 14.3% is higher than that of other legumes such as lentils with a level of 11.7%[278]. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480+270 kJ per 100g[278]. Wattle seeds are low glycaemic index foods. The starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise[278]. A sweet red or white 'lerp' that forms on the leaves and branches is eaten[183]. Lerp is a protective shield secreted from the anus of sap-sucking insects[193]. The taste is sweet and it was used as a staple food by the Aborigines in some areas of Australia[193]. It is not clear if the lerp is eaten when the insects are still present or if it can be eaten after they have gone[K]. A large succulent gall, known as 'mulga apple' is produced by the tree and is said to quench the thirst[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. The extensive root system of this plant helps to prevent soil erosion[200]. The twigs are used to make a dishmop[156].  - turns well, takes a high polish. It is used extensively for ornaments and fencing[156, 157, 167].",,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Pest tolerant, Specimen. Prefers a sandy loam and a very sunny position[1]. Succeeds in any good garden soil that is not excessively limey[11]. Most species become chlorotic on limey soils[200]. In the wild this species tolerates periodic inundation[167], though it is also very drought tolerant[245]. Hardy to at least -7c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Trees are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, even in the mildest areas of the country they are likely to be killed in excessively harsh winters[11]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.
