The flowers are expectorant and have been used in the treatment of coughs and other chest complaints[254]. The seed is demulcent, emetic, expectorant and laxative[240, 243]. An infusion, in small quantities, is used as a sedative for children, but caution is advised since the oil in the seed is strongly purgative[254]. The seed has also been used as an antidote to snake poisoning[240, 243]. The pounded seeds, mixed with mustard oil, are applied externally to treat itchy skin[272]. The oil from the seed is demulcent and purgative[254, 272]. It has been used externally in the treatment of skin problems[240, 243, 272].
