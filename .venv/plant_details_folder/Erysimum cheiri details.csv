Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antispasmodic  Aphrodisiac  Cardiotonic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Nervine  Ophthalmic  Purgative  Resolvent  Stomachic  TonicWallflower was formerly used mainly as a diuretic and emmenagogue but recent research has shown that it is more valuable for its effect on the heart[254]. In small doses it is a cardiotonic, supporting a failing heart in a similar manner to foxglove (Digitalis purpurea)[254]. In more than small doses, however, it is toxic and so is seldom used in herbal medicine[254]. The flowers and stems are antirheumatic, antispasmodic, cardiotonic, emmenagogue, nervine, purgative and resolvent[4, 7, 46, 61, 240]. They are used in the treatment of impotence and paralysis[240]. The essential oil is normally used[4]. This should be used with caution because large doses are toxic[7]. The plant contains the chemical compound cheiranthin which has a stronger cardiotonic action than digitalis (obtained from Digitalis species). If taken in large doses this is very poisonous and so this plant should not be used medicinally without expert supervision[244]. The seeds are aphrodisiac, diuretic, expectorant, stomachic and tonic[240]. They are used in the treatment of dry bronchitis, fevers and injuries to the eyes[240].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.","The flowers contain 0.06% essential oil[240]. It has a pleasing aroma if diluted and is used in perfumery[46, 61, 114, 244]. The seed contains about 20% fixed oil[240], but no details of any uses are given[K].",,"Prefers a position in full sun in a circumneutral soil[1, 111, 200]. Succeeds in ordinary garden soils[1], tolerating poor and limey soils[187]. Plants are liable to die out if the soil is too rich[111]. Wallflowers are perennial, though they are usually grown as biennials in the flower garden for spring and early summer bedding[1]. There are some named varieties[187]. A very ornamental plant[7], it is liable to die out after flowering, probably because it exhausts itself by producing so many flowers. Plants require a very well-drained dry soil if they are to survive a second winter[187]. They grow well on dry stone walls[201] and also on old mortared walls where they usually self-sow[219]. A good butterfly and moth plant[17, 30]. A good companion for apple trees[18, 20, 201].","Seed - sow spring in an outdoor seedbed. Germination should take place within 3 weeks. Plant the seedlings into their permanent positions when they are large enough to handle. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in spring in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
