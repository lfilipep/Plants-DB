19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antispasmodic  Aphrodisiac  Cardiotonic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Nervine  Ophthalmic  Purgative  Resolvent  Stomachic  TonicWallflower was formerly used mainly as a diuretic and emmenagogue but recent research has shown that it is more valuable for its effect on the heart[254]. In small doses it is a cardiotonic, supporting a failing heart in a similar manner to foxglove (Digitalis purpurea)[254]. In more than small doses, however, it is toxic and so is seldom used in herbal medicine[254]. The flowers and stems are antirheumatic, antispasmodic, cardiotonic, emmenagogue, nervine, purgative and resolvent[4, 7, 46, 61, 240]. They are used in the treatment of impotence and paralysis[240]. The essential oil is normally used[4]. This should be used with caution because large doses are toxic[7]. The plant contains the chemical compound cheiranthin which has a stronger cardiotonic action than digitalis (obtained from Digitalis species). If taken in large doses this is very poisonous and so this plant should not be used medicinally without expert supervision[244]. The seeds are aphrodisiac, diuretic, expectorant, stomachic and tonic[240]. They are used in the treatment of dry bronchitis, fevers and injuries to the eyes[240]."
20,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
21,Other Uses Description,"The flowers contain 0.06% essential oil[240]. It has a pleasing aroma if diluted and is used in perfumery[46, 61, 114, 244]. The seed contains about 20% fixed oil[240], but no details of any uses are given[K]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a position in full sun in a circumneutral soil[1, 111, 200]. Succeeds in ordinary garden soils[1], tolerating poor and limey soils[187]. Plants are liable to die out if the soil is too rich[111]. Wallflowers are perennial, though they are usually grown as biennials in the flower garden for spring and early summer bedding[1]. There are some named varieties[187]. A very ornamental plant[7], it is liable to die out after flowering, probably because it exhausts itself by producing so many flowers. Plants require a very well-drained dry soil if they are to survive a second winter[187]. They grow well on dry stone walls[201] and also on old mortared walls where they usually self-sow[219]. A good butterfly and moth plant[17, 30]. A good companion for apple trees[18, 20, 201]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in an outdoor seedbed. Germination should take place within 3 weeks. Plant the seedlings into their permanent positions when they are large enough to handle. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in spring in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer."
