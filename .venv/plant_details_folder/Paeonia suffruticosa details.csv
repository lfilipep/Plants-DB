14,Physical Characteristics,"Paeonia suffruticosa is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Flowers - cooked[46, 61, 177]. The fallen flower petals are parboiled and sweetened for a teatime delicacy, or cooked in various dishes[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antibacterial  Antiinflammatory  Antipyretic  Antispasmodic  Emmenagogue  Sedative  Styptic  TonicThe root and root bark is analgesic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antispasmodic, emmenagogue, sedative, styptic and tonic[46, 61, 174, 176, 178, 218, 279]. An extract of the plant has antibacterial activity, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus, Bacillus dysenteriae, Typhoid bacillus, Paratyphoid bacillus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, E. coli, Haemophilus pertussis and Streptococcus[176, 218]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of fevers, boils, menstrual disorders, nosebleeds, ulcers, irritability and gastro-intestinal infections[238]. This remedy should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The herb acts as a synergist when used with liquorice (Glycyrrhiza spp)[218]. A tea made from the dried crushed petals of various peony species has been used as a cough remedy, and as a treatment for haemorrhoids and varicose veins[250].",
22,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.",
23,Other Uses Description,The stems are used as firewood[11]. The plant is quite slow growing so could not really be seen as a source of fuel[K].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Seashore, Specimen. Requires a deep rich soil, preferably neutral or slightly alkaline[1], doing quite well in sun or light shade[1]. Prefers a limy soil and a sheltered position[200]. Plants are tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, but will not survive if the soil becomes waterlogged or is too dry[250]. This species is lime tolerant[200]. Plants grown on sandy soils tend to produce more leaves and less flowers, whilst those growing on clay take longer to become established but produce better blooms[250]. Hardy to about -20°c[184], plants do better in the north of Britain than they do in the south and are generally best if given an open northerly aspect[11]. Plants come into growth early in the year and are then subject to damage by late frosts, they are therefore best sited in a position that is shaded from the early morning sun[11]. The branches are brittle and very subject to wind damage, especially when young[200]. There is some confusion over the name of this species, Chinese botanists believing that it was based on a cultivar. They do not recognise this name, instead raising to specific status two of its sub-species as P. rockii (Haw.&Lauener.) Hong.&Li. and P. jishanensis Hong.&W.Z.Zhao (syn P. spontanea (Rehder.) Hong.&W.Z.Zhao.)[214]. Most modern treatments no longer recognise this as a separate species, though some people use the name to house the large number of garden forms of tree peonies that have been developed over the centuries[250]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[182]. It grows best in areas with long hot summers[1] and requires an airy position because it is very subject to fungal attack[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The flowers of some forms of this species are pleasantly scented[245]. Scented forms include 'Flora', 'Fragrans Maxima', 'Kimpai' and 'Kokuho'[245]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A very greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. The plant does not really need much pruning apart from removing dead or diseased stems. It is, however, very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back to ground level if it requires rejuvenation[200]. Strongly resents root disturbance, taking some time to recover after being divided[1]. Peony species are usually self-fertile, though they will also hybridise with other species if these flower nearby at the same time[250]. Plants take 4 - 5 years to flower from seed[200]. They generally breed true from seed[1]. Cultivated in China as a medicinal plant[214].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers, Fragrant flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[250]. When sown fresh, the seed produces a root about 6 weeks after sowing with shoots formed in the spring[200]. Stored seed is much slower, it should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame but may take 18 months or more to germinate[200]. The roots are very sensitive to disturbance, so many growers allow the seedlings to remain in their pots for 2 growing seasons before potting them up. This allows a better root system to develop that is more resilient to disturbance[250]. If following this practice, make sure you sow the seed thinly, and give regular liquid feeds in the growing season to ensure the plants are well fed. We usually prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and then grow them on in a cold frame for at least two growing seasons before planting them out when they are in growth in the spring[K].",
