All parts of the plant are used, they are astringent, cardiotonic, febrifuge, hypotensive, resolvent, stomachic, styptic, tonic and vasodilator[116, 147, 152, 176, 238, 240]. The leaf juice is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and is decocted with liquorice (Glycyrrhiza spp) for the treatment of sunstroke[218]. A decoction of the flowers is used in the treatment of premature ejaculation[218]. The flowers are recommended as a cardiac tonic[240]. A decoction of the floral receptacle is used in the treatment of abdominal cramps, bloody discharges etc[218]. The flower stalk is haemostatic[176]. It is used in treating bleeding gastric ulcers, excessive menstruation, post-partum haemorrhage[238]. The stamens are used in treating urinary frequency, premature ejaculation, haemolysis, epistasis and uterine bleeding[176, 238]. A decoction of the fruit is used in the treatment of agitation, fever, heart complaints etc[218]. The seed contains several medically active constituents, including alkaloids and flavonoids[279]. It is hypotensive, sedative and vasodilator[176, 279]. The seed has been shown to lower cholesterol levels and to relax the smooth muscle of the uterus[279]. It is used in the treatment of poor digestion, enteritis, chronic diarrhoea, spermatorrhoea, leukorrhoea, insomnia, palpitations etc[176, 218, 238, 279].

The root nodes are used in the treatment of nasal bleeding, haemoptysis, haematuria and functional bleeding of the uterus[176]. The plant has a folk history in the treatment of cancer, modern research has isolated certain compounds from the plant that show anticancer activity[218].",

23,Other Uses Description,The leaves are used as plates for eating food off[272].,
24,Cultivation Details,"Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Minor Global Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbRequires a rich loam[1]. Succeeds in water up to 2.5 metres deep[200]. In cooler climates, however, it should be grown in shallower water, though no less than 30 cm deep, which will warm up more quickly and encourage better growth and flowering[200]. The plant is happiest with water temperatures of 23 - 27°c in the growing season[260] and requires a five month growing season[264]. This species is not tremendously hardy when grown outdoors in Britain and it is best, once the leaves have died down in the autumn, to store the roots in a frost-free place, either in a tub of water or in moist sand[264].. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. Once established, they can become invasive when growing in suitable conditions[238]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties some of which have been developed for their edible uses[183]. It is said that pink-flowered forms are preferred for their edible seeds whilst the white-flowered forms are preferred for their edible roots[264]. Most forms are not cold-hardy outdoors in Britain but some, especially those from far eastern provenances are much hardier and will possibly succeed outdoors in favoured areas of Britain[200]. The flowers have a sweet fruity perfume[245]. This is the sacred Lotus of India and it is much cultivated as a food plant in the Orient[1, 2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - file the seed across its centre, being very careful not to damage the flesh of the seed, and soak in warm water, changing the water twice a day until signs of germination are seen, which should be within 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c. Plant in individual pots just covered in water and increase the depth as the plant grows. Division in spring as the plant comes into growth. Be very careful, the plants deeply resent root disturbance[200].",
