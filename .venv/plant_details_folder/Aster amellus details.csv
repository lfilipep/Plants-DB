A polymorphic species[50], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. The seed usually germinates in 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]."
