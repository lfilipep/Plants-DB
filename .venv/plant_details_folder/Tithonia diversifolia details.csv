Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Helianthus quinquelobus Sessé & Moc.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antiinflammatory  Hypoglycaemic  Kidney  Laxative  Malaria  UrinaryVarious studies have been carried out into the medicinal properties of this plant:- A methanol extract of the dried leaves reduced pain levels and inhibited oedema and granuloma, confirming the plants traditional use in the treatment of painful inflammatory conditions[360 ]. The leaves contain sesquiterpene lactones, including tagitinin ,which possess insecticidal properties. A study showed it possessed antimicrobial activity, active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that the leaves can be used in treating gastrointestinal infections, skin diseases and urinary tract infections[360 ]. An 80% ethanol extract of the leaves showed reduction of blood glucose levels 3 weeks after a single oral dose, also significantly lowering plasma insulin, decreasing blood glucose in an insulin tolerance test. The results suggest it may be useful in the treatment of type2 diabetes[360 ]. Aqueous and methanolic extracts of the plant had 50% and 74% clearing of malarial parasites respectively, compared to 100% for chloroquine. It was more effective when administered at the onset of the infection, suggesting a time-dependency of the anti-malarial effects[369 ]. A 70% methanol extract showed a dose- and time-dependent toxic effect on the kidney and liver toxicity. Although reversible, it raises concern over the safety of the use of the plant extract against malaria[360 ]. The leaves contain a bitter essential oil[331 ]. A decoction of the leaves is sometimes used in the treatment of malaria[331 ]. An infusion of leaves is used in the treatment of constipation, stomach pains, indigestion, sore throat and liver pains[418 ]. The leaves should be ground into small pieces, mixed with water, and then drunk[418 ] Leaf extracts are used externally for the treatment of wounds and haematomas[360 ].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Fertilizer: Provides a concentrated solid plant food.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.","Agroforestry Uses: The plant is used for soil improvement and has a positive effect on crop yields. Yields of maize, kale, French beans, tomatoes and Napier grass all increased when they were planted with this species[418 ]. For fertilization, it is used as a mulch which can be spread on top of the soil or buried beneath it. T. diversifolia has the ability to restore phosphorus in high amounts to the soil it contains 1.76% N, 0.82% P, and 3.92% K. All three properties are lower in cattle manure, and P is higher in poultry and swine manure. Planted as a living fence[418 ]. Other Uses: A bitter, essential oil is extracted from the leaves[331 ]. It has a repellent activity on the mosquito Anapholes gambiae, and a smaller, but still significant, action on other species of mosquito[360 ]. The stems are used as fuel[303 , 418 ].","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Fodder: Bank  Management: Coppice  Minor Global CropA plant of the tropics and subtropics, it can also be grown as a summer annual in temperate areas. It the tropics it can be found at elevations from 200 - 2,300 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 31°c, but can tolerate 12 - 38°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Succeeds in any well-drained, moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200 ]. Plants are moderately drought-resistant[418 ]. Commonly grown as an ornamental, the plant has escaped from cultivation and become a weed in many areas of the tropics and subtropics[360 ]. The plant can flower and produce seed all year round[303 ].",Seed - sow in situ.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
