24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A water plant, growing in water 15 - 60cm deep. it can also grow in wet soil but is then very restricted[56]. It requires a rich soil[56]. The tubers are not winter hardy[56]. Another report says that the plants are hardy in the milder areas of Britain[166]. They have withstood a fairly severe winter in Cornwall, when the ponds had thick ice 30cm or more deep, with very little damage[K]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers have a hawthorn-like scent[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a pot as soon as it is ripe and kept emmersed in 3cm of water. The seed can also be stored in water and sown in spring[134]. It usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in just covered in water in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division can be carried out at any time in the growing season, though mid to late spring is probably best. The divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",
