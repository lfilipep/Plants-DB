Form: Upright or erect.","Aruncus dioicus is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from June to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",A. silvester. A. vulgaris.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; Meadow; Bog Garden;,Leaves: ,,"Budlings, stems and young leaves - cooked[177].

A tea made from the roots is used to allay bleeding after child birth, to reduce profuse urination and to treat stomach pains, diarrhoea, gonorrhoea, fevers and internal bleeding[222, 257]. The tea is used externally to bathe swollen feet and rheumatic joints[222, 257]. A salve made from the root ashes is rubbed onto sores[257].",,Plants form a dense growth that is very effective at holding invasive plants at bay[208]. They can be used as a tall ground cover for large areas[208].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. Succeeds in most moist soils in sun or partial shade[187, 200, 233]. Plants do well in moist to wet soils but will also tolerate fairly dry sites[208]. Succeeds in acid or limey soils[208]. Grows well on the woodland edge[200]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. This is a polymorphic species, especially the form that grows in Japan[187]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value, 'Kneiffii' is only half the size of the type species[208]. Plants are fast-growing[208] and form very large clumps[187]. The flowers are sweetly perfumed[245]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[208]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Sow stored seed in late winter or early spring in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 15cm tall. They can be planted out into their permanent positions at any time of the year. Division in early spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, the clumps can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
