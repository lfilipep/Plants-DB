Duckweed can be a troublesome pond weed though it is easily controlled by simply scooping it out[56, 200]. This scooped out material makes an excellent addition to the compost heap. The growing plant is a good food source for fish and birds, as well as providing cover for creatures in the pond[200]. Although it is towards the limit of its climatic range in Britain, it often flowers here if growing in a sheltered sunny position[17]. It over-winters in temperate areas by means of resting buds which sink to the bottom of the pond in the late autumn and rise again in the spring[200].","Seed - we have no information on this species but, since it spreads so rapidly by division, it really needs no extra help once it is in a pond.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
