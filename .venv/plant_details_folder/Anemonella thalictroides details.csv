A delicate plant for a loose leafy soil in sun or part shade[187]. Plants dislike any root disturbance, they should be planted in their final positions whilst still young[1]. A greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. Plants are slow to establish, often falling victim to slug predations[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the summer. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in the spring. Division - this is best done in the autumn by carefully removing pieces from the outside of the clump and growing them on in pots until they are established[1, 200]. Be careful to disturb the main clump as little as possible[1]."
