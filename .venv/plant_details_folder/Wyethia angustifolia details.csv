24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a free-draining, gritty but moisture-retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants are intolerant of drought[200]. According to [200] this species requires climatic zone 9, meaning that it can only tolerate occasional light frosts. This is somewhat questionable since the plant's native range extends northwards to Washington where the winter temperatures often fall much lower than this."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse or cold frame in early spring. Use a very freely-draining compost, prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out into their permanent positions when they are large enough. Careful division of the crown as the plants come into growth in spring[200]."
