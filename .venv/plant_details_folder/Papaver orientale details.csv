Succeeds in an ordinary good soil[111, 200] and in dry soils, tolerating drought when established[190]. Plants prefer a deep soil that is poor and dry rather than rich, they dislike moist conditions[233]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A deep-rooting and almost indestructible plant, every scrap of the running root system that is left in the ground can grow into a new plant[190, 233]. There are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[187, 200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[108]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow June in an outdoor seedbed. Plant into permanent positions in September. Seed can also be sown in spring and may then flower in late summer. Division in March or October with care[200]. Another report suggests that division is very simple[190]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Root cuttings 10cm long, November/December in a cold frame[111].",
