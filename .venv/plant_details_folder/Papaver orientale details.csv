Plants prefer a deep soil that is poor and dry rather than rich, they dislike moist conditions[233]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A deep-rooting and almost indestructible plant, every scrap of the running root system that is left in the ground can grow into a new plant[190, 233].

Plant into permanent positions in September. Seed can also be sown in spring and may then flower in late summer. Division in March or October with care[200]. Another report suggests that division is very simple[190]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Root cuttings 10cm long, November/December in a cold frame[111].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
