13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Thamnocalamus spathiflorus is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,Young shoots - cooked[177]. Seed - cooked and used as a cereal[177]. The plants only flower and produce seed at intervals of several years.,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A valuable plant for screen planting in wet areas[200]. The canes are used for making baskets and pipes[25, 46, 51, 195]. They can also be used as plant supports[146]. The canes are quite brittle and so are not very useful for weaving, in their native range they are only used when better species are not available[220].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils in sun or shade so long as the soil is moist[200]. Prefers a good loamy soil in a semi-shaded position[1, 11, 25], the leaves curling up when the plant grows in strong sunlight. Dislikes drought[1]. Requires a position sheltered from cold winds[25, 195]. When grown outdoors, this species is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain[195]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c according to another report. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. A clump-forming species, it does not hinder the regeneration of tree growth in its native range and is also a very valuable species for providing food and shelter for wildlife[267]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The rootstock is caespitose[25]. Closely related to T. aristatus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings.",
