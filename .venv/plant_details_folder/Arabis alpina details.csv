24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in ordinary well-drained soil[1, 134]. Prefers a sandy loam and a sunny position. Another report says that it prefers partial shade[134]. Plants resent root disturbance and are best put in their final positions whilst still small[134]. The flowers are attractive to bees."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it is best to surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a light position in a cold frame[134]. Seed can also be sown in spring. It usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks at 21°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division after flowering[111]. Very easy, the divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions if required. Cuttings in a shady border in summer[1]."
