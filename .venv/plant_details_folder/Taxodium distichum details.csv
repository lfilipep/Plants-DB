Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Pyramidal, Upright or erect.","Taxodium distichum is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can grow in water. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Cupressus disticha.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Pond; Bog Garden;,None known,Analgesic: Relieves pain.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It weighs 28lb per cubic foot[227]. The wood is not given to excessive warping or shrinking[227], it is used for construction, water pipes, vats etc[1, 46, 61, 82, 149, 171, 227].",,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Massing, Screen, Specimen, Street tree. Although this plant can be grown in wet soils and shallow water, it thrives in any soil and trees actually grow faster in normal unflooded soils[81]. Established plants succeed in standing water up to 60cm deep[200] - in such a situation the roots develop 'knees', curious cone-shaped structures that grow above the ground[227]. Tolerates the high pH of chalk streams[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Fairly cold-tolerant, but branches can be damaged by temperatures below -10°c[200]. A fairly vigorous tree, it can grow up to 45cm in a year with up to 4cm increase in girth[185]. It has been planted for its timber in S. Europe, especially on alluvial soils[50]. Buds often begin to break in March, but trees do not come properly into leaf until June and growth in height rarely starts before June[185]. A very healthy species in Britain, rarely seen in anything but good health. It seems to be a very long-lived tree in this country with several specimens more than 250 years old[185]. Trees are thought to live for over 1,000 years in the wild[227]. Plants grow best in areas with warm summers[200]. They only produce fertile seeds after long hot summers[200]. The branches are brittle and subject to wind damage, but the tree usually recovers well[81]. Unlike most conifers, this species responds well to coppicing[81].  Special Features:North American native, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If sowing a lot of seed you could sow it in early spring in an outdoor seedbed[78]. Allow the plants to grow on in the seedbed for two years and then plant them into their permanent positions in late autumn or early spring.
