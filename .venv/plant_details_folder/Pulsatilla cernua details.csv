The root is anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, astringent and sedative[174, 176, 218]. The root is an effective cure for bacterial and amoebic dysentery[176, 218].

The seed usually germinates in about 2 - 3 weeks. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. Germination takes about 1 - 6 months at 15°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the spring. Root cuttings, 4cm long taken in early winter, potted up in a mixture of peat and sand[175]. They can also be taken in July/August, planted vertically in pots in a greenhouse or frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
