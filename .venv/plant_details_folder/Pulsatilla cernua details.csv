It is also used in the treatment of nose bleeds and haemorrhoids and is used externally to treat Trichomonas vaginitis[176]. The fresh herb is a cardiac and nervous sedative, producing a hypnotic state with a diminution of the senses followed by a paralysing action[218].

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained humus-rich gritty soil and a sunny position[200]. Tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. This species is closely related to P. dahurica[200]. Large plants have a deep woody rootstock and transplant badly[200]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early summer in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in about 2 - 3 weeks. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. Germination takes about 1 - 6 months at 15°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the spring. Root cuttings, 4cm long taken in early winter, potted up in a mixture of peat and sand[175]. They can also be taken in July/August, planted vertically in pots in a greenhouse or frame."
