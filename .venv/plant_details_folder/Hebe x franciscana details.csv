Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Early fall, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Rounded.","Hebe x franciscana is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. It is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Veronica decussata. V. elliptica. Hort non Forst.f. V. franciscana.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","One of the most wind and spray resistant shrubs[11], it is much used as hedging plant, particularly in maritime areas of the country[182]. It succeeds on the top of Cornish hedges[11]. Requires minimal clipping only. Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Erosion control, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, forest garden.",,"Prefers a light well-drained soil in a sunny position[11, 200]. Succeeds in most soils so long as they are not boggy or too dry[182]. Very tolerant of salt and wind[184], it succeeds in very exposed maritime positions[182]. Chalk tolerant[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. This species is commonly grown in the Atlantic zone coastal gardens, but it is not reliably hardy inland[11]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c, succeeding outdoors in the milder areas of the country and self-sowing in the Isles of Scilly where it appears wild[184]. Young vigorously growing plants are very susceptible to frost damage but may become hardier after their first winter[11]. A number of forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on the young plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. It would probably be worthwhile giving some protection to the plant for its first winter outdoors. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half ripe wood, 3 - 5cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up when roots are forming and keep in a frame or greenhouse for its first winter before planting out in late spring. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn or winter in a frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
