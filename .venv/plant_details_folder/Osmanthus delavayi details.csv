23,Other Uses Description,"Can be grown as a tall hedge, it is quite amenable to trimming[29]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any well-drained soil in sun or part shade[184], but flowering more freely in a sunny position[182]. Thrives in chalky conditions[200]. Dislikes unduly exposed positions[11] and requires shelter from freezing winds[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are sweetly scented[182]. It is fairly slow-growing[219]. One report says that fruits are only occasionally produced in Britain[182] whilst another says that plants self-sow in Cornwall[11]. Plants are very amenable to pruning and can be kept quite small by cutting them back after flowering."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a coldframe[200]. Stored seed probably germinates best if it is given 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification before sowing[113]. The seed usually takes 6 - 18 months to germinate, it should be pricked out into individual pots when it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in the greenhouse and plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood taken at the end of July, in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. A good percentage. Plant out in the spring 18 months later[78]. Layering in spring[200] or autumn[78]. Partially sever the layer leads in the following late summer and plant out in the autumn. High percentage[78]."
