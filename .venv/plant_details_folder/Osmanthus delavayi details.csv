See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Siphonosmanthus delavayi.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,,"Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Thrives in chalky conditions[200]. Dislikes unduly exposed positions[11] and requires shelter from freezing winds[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are sweetly scented[182]. It is fairly slow-growing[219]. One report says that fruits are only occasionally produced in Britain[182] whilst another says that plants self-sow in Cornwall[11]. Plants are very amenable to pruning and can be kept quite small by cutting them back after flowering.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a coldframe[200]. Stored seed probably germinates best if it is given 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification before sowing[113]. The seed usually takes 6 - 18 months to germinate, it should be pricked out into individual pots when it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in the greenhouse and plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood taken at the end of July, in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. A good percentage. Plant out in the spring 18 months later[78]. Layering in spring[200] or autumn[78]. Partially sever the layer leads in the following late summer and plant out in the autumn. High percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
