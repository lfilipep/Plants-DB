20,Other Uses,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: A unique property of the species is the secretion of compounds that act as potent bactericides, fungicides and algaecides[ 381 ]. The heartwood is a very dark red, with faint streaks of black similar to rosewood (Dalbergia nigra); it is clearly demarcated from the thick band of nearly white sapwood. The texture is fine, the grain crossed, lustrous in colour with a faintly fragrant smell. The wood is hard, heavy, strong, tough, and durable in contact with the soil. It is rather difficult to work, but takes a good polish. It is used for a wide range of items including knife and tool handles, musical and scientific instruments, inlay, jewellery boxes, rosary beads, chess pieces and steering wheels[ 46 , 333 , 381 , 551 ]. This is the wood used commonly by indigenous people for carving[ 333 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have no specific information on this species, but members of this genus generally prefer a fertile, loam soil and a position in full sun[ 200 ]. A slow-growing species[ 381 ]. Cocobolo responds well to fire. In areas experiencing periodic burning new saplings and small trees are observed to be numerous[ 381 ]. Trees often flower all year round[ 315 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - a germination rate up to 80% has been observed in the nursery[ 381 ]. Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ]."
