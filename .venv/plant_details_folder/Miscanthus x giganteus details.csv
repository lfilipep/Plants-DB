See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,None Known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Very few perennial industrial crops have been properly domesticated. Those that have show significantly increased yields. Miscanthus x giganteus is partly domesticated  [1-1]. An outstanding biomass producer in temperate climates needing very little nitrogen fertilizer. Most giant Miscanthus is used as biofuel but could also serve as a feedstock for any number of biobased materials [1-1]. : bank. A possible good candidate for contour hedgerows in agroforestry. An excellent wind break. A popular ornamental - Outstanding fall color with persistent winter interest.","Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Perennial Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers.",Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  New Perennial CropClimate: cold temperate to subtropical. Humidity: humid. A sterile (non-invasive) hybrid of M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus. A very fast growing to 4m in 15 months - but manageable plant. Dry to average water needs - sensitive to too much water on roots. Drought Tolerant. well-drained soil. Full sun. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].,Vegetative propagation methods are necessary since giant Miscanthus does not produce viable seed.
