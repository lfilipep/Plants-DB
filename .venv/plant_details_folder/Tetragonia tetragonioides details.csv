24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in the garden[193], it prefers a light soil in a sunny position[16, 37] and thrives in dry soils[33]. It grows best in a good rich soil[1]. Once established, the plants tolerate drought[200]. Plants are very tolerant of hot, dry conditions but cannot tolerate frost[200]. Although very drought tolerant, the plants produce a better quality crop if they are given some water in dry weather[264]. New Zealand spinach is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its edible leaves, it is an excellent spinach substitute for hot dry weather conditions[183]. A perennial plant in its native habitat, but it is usually killed by the cold in British winters and so is grown as an annual[264]. In the Tropics it is occasionally cultivated in the cool season as a spinach[264]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frost[33]. Seed can also be sown in situ in late spring, though this will not generally make such good plants[33, K]. The seed can be slow to germinate, soaking in warm water for 24 hours prior to sowing may help[33, 200]."
