Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Specimen, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a rich light soil[1]. Grows best in a light but good woodland soil, preferably not limy[208]. Prefers light shade and some shelter from winds[175]. Tolerates a sunny position if it is growing in a moist border but once planted the plant should not be disturbed since the roots are brittle[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to at least -20°c[187]. The seed is difficult to harvest, it ripens and is shed very quickly[134]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[134]. Stored seed should be sown in early spring[175]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[175]. Two weeks warm stratification at 18°c followed by six weeks at 2°c can shorten up the germination time[134]. Prick out the plants into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, grow them on for their first winter in a cold frame and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring. Division in early spring[200]. Care must be taken since the plant strongly resents root disturbance[200]. Division is best carried out in late winter[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings 7 - 10cm long in sandy soil in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
