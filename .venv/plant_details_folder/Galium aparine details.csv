19,Edible Uses Description,"eaThe tender young shoot tips - raw or cooked as a pot-herb[5, 7, 53, 55, 62, 172, 183]. A rather bitter flavour that some people find unpalatable[244], they are best used in the spring[178]. They make a useful addition to vegetable soups[7, 244]. It is said that using this plant as a vegetable has a slimming effect on the body[238]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[2, 53, 62]. One of the best substitutes, it merely needs to be dried and lightly roasted and has much the flavour of coffee[4, 115, 183]. A decoction of the whole dried plant gives a drink equal to tea[2, 4]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antiphlogistic  Aperient  Astringent  Cancer  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Febrifuge  Homeopathy  Skin  Tonic  VulneraryGoosegrass has a long history of domestic medicinal use and is also used widely by modern herbalists. A valuable diuretic, it is often taken to treat skin problems such as seborrhoea, eczema and psoriasis, and as a general detoxifying agent in serious illnesses such as cancer[254]. The whole plant, excluding the root, is alterative, antiphlogistic, aperient, astringent, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge, tonic and vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 21, 165, 218, 222]. It is harvested in May and June as it comes into flower and can be used fresh or dried for later use[4, 238]. It is used both internally and externally in the treatment of a wide range of ailments, including as a poultice for wounds, ulcers and many other skin problems[4, 7, 244], and as a decoction for insomnia and cases where a strong diuretic is beneficial[4]. It has been shown of benefit in the treatment of glandular fever, ME, tonsillitis, hepatitis, cystitis etc[238]. The plant is often used as part of a spring tonic drink with other herbs[4]. A tea made from the plant has traditionally been used internally and externally in the treatment of cancer[4, 218, 222]. One report says that it is better to use a juice of the plant rather than a tea[254]. The effectiveness of this treatment has never been proved or disproved[7]. Both Asperuloside (a terpenoid) and Coumarin (a benzopyrone) occur in some species of Galium. Asperuloside can be converted into prostaglandins (hormone-like compounds that stimulate the uterus and affect blood vessels), making the genus of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry[238]. A homeopathic remedy has been made from the plant[7]."
22,Other Uses,"Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Filter: Used to strain out particles from liquids.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling."
23,Other Uses Description,"A red dye is obtained from a decoction of the root[4, 7, 168]. When ingested it can dye the bones red[4]. The dried plant is used as a tinder[99]. The plant can be rubbed on the hands to remove pitch (tar)[99]. The stems are placed in a layer 8cm or more thick and then used as a sieve for filtering liquids[4, 115, 172]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a loose moist leafy soil in some shade[200]. Plants tolerate dry soils, but they quickly become scorched when growing in full sun[200]. They do not thrive in a hot climate[200]. Another report says that plants succeed in most soils in full sun or heavy shade. A scrambling plant, the stems and leaves are covered with little hooked bristles by which it can adhere to other plants and climb into them[4]. A good species to grow in the wild garden, it provides food for the larvae of many butterfly species[30]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in situ as soon as the seed is ripe in late summer[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring though it may be very slow to germinate[200]. Once established, this plant does not really need any help to reproduce itself."
