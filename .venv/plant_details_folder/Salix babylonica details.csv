Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Weeping.","Salix babylonica is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",S. pendula.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ","Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","w or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots and flower buds - cooked[105, 177, 183]. Not very palatable[172]. Older leaves are used to adulterate tea[183]. A source of a manna-like substance[183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antirheumatic  Astringent  Febrifuge  Poultice  SkinThe leaves and bark are antirheumatic, astringent and tonic[178, 240]. A decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of abscesses, carbuncle, fever, rheumatism, skin diseases, ulcers etc[218]. An infusion of the bark has been used to treat diarrhoea and fevers[257]. The bark can be used as a poultice[257]. The stem bark is used in the treatment of skin eruptions due to parasites[218]. The root bark is used in a bath for the treatment of parasitic skin diseases[218]. A gum from the stems is used in the treatment of foul sores[218]. The down of the seeds is used in the treatment of fevers, haemorrhages, jaundice, rheumatism etc[218]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.","Landscape Uses: Erosion control, Aggressive surface roots possible, Pollard, Specimen.  The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[146, 272]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The extensive root system makes this species useful for binding soils[146, 272]. A decoction or infusion of the bark has been used as a wash to make the hair grow[257]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. This species rarely thrives in Britain[11], it is very subject to canker and has been largely replaced in cultivation by S. 'Chrysocoma'[188]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Wetlands plant, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.
