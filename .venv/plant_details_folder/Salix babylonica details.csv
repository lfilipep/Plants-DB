Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antirheumatic  Astringent  Febrifuge  Poultice  SkinThe leaves and bark are antirheumatic, astringent and tonic[178, 240]. A decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of abscesses, carbuncle, fever, rheumatism, skin diseases, ulcers etc[218]. An infusion of the bark has been used to treat diarrhoea and fevers[257]. The bark can be used as a poultice[257]. The stem bark is used in the treatment of skin eruptions due to parasites[218]. The root bark is used in a bath for the treatment of parasitic skin diseases[218]. A gum from the stems is used in the treatment of foul sores[218]. The down of the seeds is used in the treatment of fevers, haemorrhages, jaundice, rheumatism etc[218]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Erosion control, Aggressive surface roots possible, Pollard, Specimen.  The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[146, 272]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The extensive root system makes this species useful for binding soils[146, 272]. A decoction or infusion of the bark has been used as a wash to make the hair grow[257]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. This species rarely thrives in Britain[11], it is very subject to canker and has been largely replaced in cultivation by S. 'Chrysocoma'[188]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Wetlands plant, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
