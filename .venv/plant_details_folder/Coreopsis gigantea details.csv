Prefers a fertile well-drained moisture retentive medium soil[111, 200]. Requires a sunny position[111, 200]. Established plants are drought resistant[1]. This species is not very cold hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[200, 260]. It dislikes winter wet and so is also apt to die out over the winter if grown on clay soils[111]. It is best grown in a greenhouse in this country[1]. The cut flowers last well in water[260]. The flowers are loved by bees[260]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer[111]. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in mid spring. Once they are more than 15cm tall, plant the seedlings out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring. Cuttings of young basal shoots, May/June in a frame[200]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
