The whole plant is antiaphonic, astringent, blood purifier, cholagogue, diuretic, tonic and vulnerary. It contains up to 5% tannin, which has a strongly astringent effect[244].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in most soils[133, 200], preferring a calcareous soil[13]. Thrives in a dry lightly shaded position[14], though it prefers full sun[238]. Plants usually self-sow quite freely when growing in a suitable position[238]. The seeds are contained in burrs that can easily attach themselves to clothing or animal's fur, thus transporting them to a new area where they can germinate and grow[244]. The cultivar 'Sweet scented' is popular in France for making tea because the whole plant is sweet scented and the flowers have a spicy apricot-like fragrance[183].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - can be sown in spring or autumn, either in pots in a cold frame or in situ. It usually germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 13°c[133], though germination rates can be low, especially if the seed has been stored[244]. A period of cold stratification helps but is not essential. When grown in pots, prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in autumn[200]. Very easy, the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",
