Given the similarity in appearance with many other plants, native and non, we would not suggest eating any part of Prairie Parsley [1-5]."

Prairie Parsley is one of the species in the Carrot family that the oligolectic bee, Andrena ziziae, visits for pollen and nectar. The caterpillars of a butterfly, Papilio polyxenes asterius (Black Swallowtail), feed on the foliage of this plant. Cattle and other mammalian herbivores browse readily on the non-toxic foliage [1-6]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A biennial or short-lived perennial. Easily mistaken for Wild Parsnip, an invasive non-native weed, however, this species has been in decline at least in the periphery of its range due to the destruction of native prairie for agricultural and commercial development. Prairie Parsley leaf looks like flat leaf or Italian parsley and is finely divided while Wild Parsnip leaf is not.  Light Requirement: Sun , Part Shade. Soil Moisture: Medium-Wet, Medium, Medium-Dry, Dry. Bloom Color: Yellow. Bloom Time: Jun , Jul. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Cold moist stratification used to simulate the real-world conditions a seed would receive outdoors after the frozen winter gives way to a warm, wet spring. Plant outdoors in the fall [1-5]."
