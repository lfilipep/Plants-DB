It is unlikely to succeed outside the very mildest areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a moist but well-drained humus rich soil in shade or full sun[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown when ripe in the autumn in a warm greenhouse[200]. The seed can be slow to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Air layering[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
