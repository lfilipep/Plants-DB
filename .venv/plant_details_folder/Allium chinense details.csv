It contains about 3.1% protein, 0.12% fat, 18.3% soluble carbohydrate, 0.7% ash[179]. Leaves - raw or cooked[179]. Flowers and young seedpods - raw[179]. Used as a garnish on salads."

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Carminative  Dysentery  ExpectorantThe whole plant is astringent, carminative and expectorant[176]. It is used in the treatment of stuffiness sensation and pain in the chest, angina pectoris, pleurisy, bronchitis, diarrhoea and tenesmus in cases of dysentery[176]. Although no other specific mention of medicinal uses has been seen for this species, members of this genus are in general very healthy additions to the diet. They contain sulphur compounds (which give them their onion flavour) and when added to the diet on a regular basis they help reduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the digestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[K]."

23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1]. Tolerates poor soils[206]. Plants often die-back in hot weather mid-summer, coming back into growth in late summer and flowering in the autumn[206]. The flowers seldom set seed in Britain[206]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. This species is widely cultivated for its edible bulb and leaves, mainly in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of Japan, China and many other parts of eastern Asia[58, 183, 266]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. Very easy, the plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season and the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required."
