22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most fairly good soils in sun or semi-shade[1, 111]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. This species is closely related to T. lucidum[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in spring[111]. Plant them into their permanent positions the following spring. Division in spring as new growth commences or in the autumn[111]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring."
