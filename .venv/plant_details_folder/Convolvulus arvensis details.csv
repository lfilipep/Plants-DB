Bindweed is a very deep-rooting plant with a vigorous root system that extends to a considerable distance and is very hard to eradicate from the soil. Even a small piece of the root will grow into a new plant if it is left in the ground. Once established this plant soon becomes a pernicious weed[1, 4]. It is a climbing plant that supports itself by twining around any support it can find and can soon swamp and strangle other plants[4]. The flowers close at night and also during rainy weather[4]. Although visited by numerous insects, the flowers seldom set fertile seed[4]. On sunny days the flowers diffuse a scent of heliotrope[245]. The plant harbours tobacco mosaic virus of the Solanaceae[13] and so should not be grown near potatoes, tomatoes and other members of that family.","Seed - best sown in situ as soon as it is ripe, it germinates in the autumn[164].
