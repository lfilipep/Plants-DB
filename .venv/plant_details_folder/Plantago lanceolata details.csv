The leaves contain mucilage, tannin and silic acid[244]. An extract of them has antibacterial properties[240]. They have a bitter flavour and are astringent, demulcent, mildly expectorant, haemostatic and ophthalmic[9, 13, 21, 145, 165, 222, 244, 254]. Internally, they are used in the treatment of a wide range of complaints including diarrhoea, gastritis, peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, haemorrhage, haemorrhoids, cystitis, bronchitis, catarrh, sinusitis, asthma and hay fever[238, 254].

Plantain seeds contain up to 30% mucilage which swells up in the gut, acting as a bulk laxative and soothing irritated membranes[238]. Sometimes the seed husks are used without the seeds[238]. A distilled water made from the plant makes an excellent eye lotion[7].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Starch: Used as a fabric stiffener.","A good fibre is obtained from the leaves[4], it is said to be suitable for textiles[115]. A mucilage from the seed coats is used as a fabric stiffener[4]. It is obtained by macerating the seed in hot water[100, 115]. Gold and brown dyes are obtained from the whole plant[168].

An important food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies[30]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. A sowing can be made outdoors in situ in mid to late spring if you have enough seeds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
