See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A delicious flavour. The fruit is up to 3cm across[198]. Fresh fruits contain 100 - 420mg vitamin C per 100g and 8 - 14% carbohydrate[218]. Acidity is 1 - 2%, mainly citric acid[218]. The fruit contains a number of small seeds, but these are easily eaten with the fruit[K]. The leaves are eaten cooked in times of need as a famine food[179].","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Febrifuge  Sedative  Urinary  Vitamin CThe fruits, stems and roots are diuretic, febrifuge and sedative[147]. They are used in the treatment of stones in the urinary tract, rheumatoid arthralgia, cancers of the liver and oesophagus[147]. A decoction of the leaves is used to treat mange in dogs[218]. The stem-juice is used in the treatment of gravel[218].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Pencil: A couple of plants especially mentioned for making the tubes that pencil leads fit into.","is made from the bark[178]. If the bark is removed in one piece from near the root and placed in hot ashes, it becomes very hard and can be used as a tube for a pencil[178]. The plant is said to have insecticidal properties (no more details)[218].",,"Prefers a sound loamy neutral soil[1, 200]. Succeeds in semi-shade but full sun is best for fruit production[200]. Prefers a sheltered position[200]. The dormant plant is hardy to about -15°c[184], though new growth in spring is very susceptible to frost damage[11]. This species is the parent of the cultivated Kiwi fruits, these cultivars are now included under the name A. deliciosa[200]. Fruits are formed on second year wood and also on fruit spurs on older wood[126], any pruning is best carried out in the winter[219]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This is a climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around branches etc[200]. The ssp. A. chinensis setosa.(newly named, no author as yet) is found in Taiwan from 1300 - 2600m[198]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[133]. It is probably best if the seed is given 3 months stratification[113], either sow it in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in November or as soon as it is received. Fresh seed germinates in 2 - 3 months at 10°c, stored seed can take longer[133]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. When the plants are 30cm or more tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[K]. Most seedlings are male[126]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, they must be kept well ventilated[113]. Cuttings of softwood as soon as ready in spring in a frame[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of ripe wood, October/November in a frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
