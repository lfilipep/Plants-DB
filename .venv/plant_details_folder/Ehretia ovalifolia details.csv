24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained sandy loam in a sunny position[200]. Requires a sheltered position[299]. Plants are shade tolerant in continental climates but they require more sun in maritime areas in order to ripen the wood[200]. Rich fertile soils tend to encourage soft sappy growth which is then subject to frost damage over winter[200]. Young trees are tender in Britain but they become perfectly hardy as they grow older[11]. The young growth in spring is frost-tender[K]. Closely allied to E. acuminata and included in that species by some botanists[11]. A tree was 10 metres tall at Bath botanical gardens in 1989[K]. The flowers, which are produced on the ripened wood of the previous season's growth, have a soft sweet perfume[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Sow stored seed in late winter or early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame.",
