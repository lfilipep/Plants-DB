20,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc."
21,Other Uses Description,"The plant produces strong fibres that can be used in making cordage products[269]. The fibres produce a paper with exceptional tensile and tear strength. Such fibres could be used either in speciality papers with high-strength requirements, such as currency papers, bible papers, tea bags, and filters, or they could be blended with other fibres to increase the strength and improve the texture of a variety of paper products, including writing papers, tissue and towel products, and papers manufactured using secondary (recycled) fibre[269]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Under DevelopmentRequires a warm, sheltered sunny position in a well-drained soil[200]. Plants do not like wet conditions, especially in the winter[200]. Plants grow for several years before flowering but, unlike the related agaves and yuccas, the plants do not die after flowering."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. It usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some winter protection for at least their first winter outdoors - a simple pane of glass is usually sufficient[K].
