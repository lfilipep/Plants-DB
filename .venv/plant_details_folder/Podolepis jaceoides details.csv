24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. They are usually grown as an annual in Britain[1, 200], but could possibly succeed as a perennial in the milder areas of the country."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[1]. If you have plenty of seed it is worth trying a sowing outdoors in situ in late spring[1]. Division in spring."
