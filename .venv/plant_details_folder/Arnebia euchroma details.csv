22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a well-drained gritty soil and a sunny position in the rock garden or on a dry wall[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 8 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. It is best to harvest the seed when it is slightly under-ripe, since it is quickly dispersed when ripe[200]. Cuttings with a heel in the autumn in sand in a cold frame[1]. Root cuttings in sand in a frame during the winter[1].",
