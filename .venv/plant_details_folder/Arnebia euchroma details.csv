Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antipyretic  Cancer  Contraceptive  Eczema  Emollient  VulneraryThe root is antipyretic, cancer, contraceptive, emollient and vulnerary[176]. It is used in the treatment of measles, mild constipation, burns, frostbite, eczema, dermatitis etc[176, 218]. Experimentally it has shown contraceptive action on rats, inhibiting oestrus, the fertility rate and the release of pituitary gonadotrophin hormone and chorion gonadotrophin hormone[176]. It inhibits the growth of cancer cells on the chorion membrane[176]. The root contains shikonin, an antitumour and bactericidal compound[218]. It inhibits the growth of E. coli, Bacillus typhi, B. dysenteriae, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus[218]. Shikonin also promotes the healing of wounds on topical application[176].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,The root contains a copious purple dye[266].,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a well-drained gritty soil and a sunny position in the rock garden or on a dry wall[1].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 8 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. It is best to harvest the seed when it is slightly under-ripe, since it is quickly dispersed when ripe[200]. Cuttings with a heel in the autumn in sand in a cold frame[1]. Root cuttings in sand in a frame during the winter[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
