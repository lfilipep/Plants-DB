19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves and flower buds - raw or cooked[62, 177, 183]. A very mild flavour, when boiled as greens they are best mixed with other stronger tasting leaves[183]. When added to soup they thicken it in much the same way as okra[62, 85, 159]. Flowers - raw[62, 85]. The leaves are a good tea substitute[62, 85, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Emetic  PoulticeA tea made from the roots has been used in the treatment of pain in the bladder region[222, 257]. The roots and leaves have traditionally been used to induce vomiting, they have also been poulticed and applied to skin abrasions and boils[222]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any fertile soil in full sun or partial shade[233]. Prefers a cool position[233] in a moist well-drained humus-rich soil in partial or dappled shade and protection from scorching winds. Tolerates sandstone and limestone soils but becomes chlorotic if the pH is too high. Prefers a pH between 6 and 6.5. Hardy to about -25°c[187]. All members of this genus have more or less edible leaves and flower buds, though those species with yellow flowers can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62, 85, 159]. This species has mainly white flowers that are at first yellowish at the base then turn violet[222]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in the autumn or just after flowering. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring."
