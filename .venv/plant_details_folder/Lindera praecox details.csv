24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free rather moist soil[200]. Prefers partial shade or dappled sunlight in a fertile moisture-retentive soil enriched with leafmould[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], but it is rather tender in Britain and is best grown in a semi-shaded position on a wall[200, 219]. It is fairly hardy at Kew, but it only flowers well there when it is grown on a wall[11]. Plants can be pruned right back to the base if required, though any drastic pruning is best spread over several seasons[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Give some protection from cold for at least the plants first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July in a frame[200].
