It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",S. zeylanica. non Willd.,South Wall. By. West Wall.

This species is not very frost hardy, though it can succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of the country if it is given a selected sunny position[42]. Plants must be kept dry after they have flowered[42]. There is a lot of confusion between this species, S. roxburghiana. Schult. from India and S. zeylanica. (L.)Willd. from Sri Lanka[200]. It is most likely that they all have similar uses, though none of them are likely to be very hardy in Britain.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a warm greenhouse in April. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least a couple of years in a greenhouse before trying any of them outdoors. Division of suckers as growth commences in the spring. Leaf-cuttings, 7cm long placed in sand in a frame[1]. The leaf is cut into sections, the cut surfaces allowed to dry for a few hours, and the sections then placed in pots in a warm light frame, but with shelter from direct sunlight. Rooting and new growth should take place within a month.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
