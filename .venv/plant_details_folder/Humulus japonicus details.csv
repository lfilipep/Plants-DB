24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good garden soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 200]. Prefers a deep rich loam[1]. A fast growing plant, with annual stems of up to 10 metres long being produced[219]. Plants rarely survive the winter outdoors in Britain, so are best grown as annuals[219]. This report needs confirmation since the plant is also reported as being hardy in zone 5 which would mean that it should succeed outdoors virtually anywhere in Britain[K]. A climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around the branches of other plants[219]. The bruised leaves are refreshingly aromatic whilst the flowers cast a pleasing scent[245]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[37]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring as new growth begins[1]. Take the divisions when the new shoots are about 10cm above ground level. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings in March. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
