18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked[2, 20, 46, 61, 183]. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. One report says that eating these leaves appears to stimulate or intoxicate to some extent[2]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[2, 20, 46, 61]. Considered to be a great delicacy[177]. The flowers are a traditional food in China where they are steamed and then dried[266]. The flowers can be dried and used as a relish or a thickener in soups etc[178, 183]. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]. Root - raw or cooked[183, 205]. A radish-like flavour but not so sharp[205]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antidote  Cancer  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Vitamin CAnodyne, antidote, diuretic, febrifuge[178]. The juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. The root also has a folk history of use in the treatment of cancer - extracts from the roots have shown antitumour activity[218]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205]."
22,Other Uses,"Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil and a sunny position[111] but tolerating partial shade[88]. Plants flower less freely in a shady position though the flowers can last longer in such a position[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[187]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. A very ornamental plant, its roots are slender and not tuberous, whilst the rhizomes are not spreading[187]. The roots sometimes have bulbous swellings at their tips[205]. The flowers open in the evening and live for about 2 days[205]. The flowers have a powerful scent of honeysuckle[245]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
