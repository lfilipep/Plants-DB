See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from August to September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",S. mauritanica. S. nigra.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ","Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.","Young shoots - raw or cooked as a vegetable[89, 100, 148, 183, 272]. They can be cooked and used as an asparagus substitute. The tendrils are also eaten[148]. The plant is an ingredient of soft drinks[7, 14]. (this probably refers to the root)","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antipsoriatic: Used to treat psoriasis (an autoimmune disease that affects the skin).,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antipsoriatic  Demulcent  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Parasiticide  Stimulant  TonicThe root is alterative, demulcent, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, stimulant and tonic[7, 14]. This is one of the best depurative medicines and is used as a springtime tonic and general body cleanser, usually with woody nightshade (Solanum dulcamara)[7]. The root has all the medicinal virtues of the widely used tropical herb sarsaparilla, though to a lesser degree[7]. It is often used as an adulterant to that plant[7]. The ripe fruits are squeezed and applied to the skin in the treatment of scabies[272].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.",A red dye is obtained from the ripe tendrils[148]. The plant is often grown as an impenetrable hedge in warmer countries than Britain[7].,,"Succeeds in most soils in sun or semi-shade[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is only hardy in the mildest areas of Britain[11, 166], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. The flowers have a heavy sweet perfume[245]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow March in a warm greenhouse[1]. This note probably refers to the tropical members of the genus, seeds of plants from cooler areas seem to require a period of cold stratification, some species taking 2 or more years to germinate[K]. We sow the seed of temperate species in a cold frame as soon as we receive it, and would sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if we could obtain it then[K]. When the seedlings eventually germinate, prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year, though we normally grow them on in pots for 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in early spring as new growth begins[238]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.
