18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked[205]. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[177]. A flowering stem bears two trumpet-shaped blossoms, each about 6cm long and 6cm in diameter[205]. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]. If this species has swollen roots then they can be eaten raw or cooked[205]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Vitamin CThe juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205].

23,Other Uses Description,The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205]. Attractive flowers.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeding in sun or shade, it produces more flowers in a sunny position though these flowers can be shorter-lived in very sunny positions[205]. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. This species has not been grown in Europe but, coming from the island of Sakhalin in N. Japan, it should prove to be hardy in most parts of Britain[205]. Individual flowers only live for one day[205]. The plant produces short scapes with only two flowers on a scape[205]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
