0,Hemerocallis darrowiana,Day Lily,Hemerocallidaceae,Coming soon,"Large quantities of the leaves are said to be hallucinogenic. Blanching the leaves removes this hallucinatory component[205]. (This report does not make clear what it means by blanching, it could be excluding light from the growing shoots or immersing in boiling water[K].)",Not known,E. Asia - N. Japan.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Hemerocallis darrowiana is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  It is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked[205]. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[177]. A flowering stem bears two trumpet-shaped blossoms, each about 6cm long and 6cm in diameter[205]. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]. If this species has swollen roots then they can be eaten raw or cooked[205].","Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Vitamin CThe juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205].,"Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.",The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205]. Attractive flowers.,,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeding in sun or shade, it produces more flowers in a sunny position though these flowers can be shorter-lived in very sunny positions[205]. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. This species has not been grown in Europe but, coming from the island of Sakhalin in N. Japan, it should prove to be hardy in most parts of Britain[205]. Individual flowers only live for one day[205]. The plant produces short scapes with only two flowers on a scape[205]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200].","Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
