0,Juniperus drupacea,Syrian Juniper,Cupressaceae,6-9,None known,"Rocky slopes in forest or scrub, 1000 - 1500 metres in Turkey[93].","S. Europe, W. Asia, N. Africa.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/JuniperusDrupacea.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/JuniperusDrupacea2.jpg",,"Juniperus drupacea is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Arceuthos drupacea.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Large and sweet[2, 61, 105].The cones are about 20 - 25mm in diameter and take 2 years to mature[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Succeeds in dry soils, tolerating drought once it is established[185]. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[11]. Prefers a limestone soil, growing well on chalk, but it also succeeds in very acid soils[200]. Grows well on dry banks[200]. A very ornamental plant[1] that is fairly fast growing for a juniper[81, 185]. A tree at Westonbirt Arboretum was 7 metres tall after 23 years[81, 185]. This species is resistant to honey fungus[88]. Cones are rarely if ever produced in Britain, could this be due to a lack of female trees?[1] Only male trees have been seen in cultivation in Britain[185]. Seed takes 2 years to mature[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
