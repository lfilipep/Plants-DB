It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. Dry with a very poor flavour[K]. The fruits are about 8mm long[200]. Leaves - cooked.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antibacterial  Antiseptic  Cancer  Dysentery  FebrifugeThe root bark is anthelmintic, antiseptic and febrifuge[178]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",
23,Other Uses Description,Plants can be grown as a medium-size hedge[29]. They are very tolerant of trimming and have prickles which make them an effective barrier to larger creatures[K]. The cultivar 'Atropurpurea Nana' can be used for ground cover[208]. It makes a dense covering when planted 30cm apart each way[208]. A yellow dye is obtained from the root and branches[178]. An Ornamental plant.,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Foundation, Pest tolerant, Hedge, Massing, Rock garden, Standard, Superior hedge, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a warm moist loamy soil but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Prefers a lime-free soil according to one report[182]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[11, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. A commonly grown ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[182]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely, they resprout well from the base[200]. Unlike most other members of this genus, this plant does not usually hybridize with other species[67]. An alternate host of 'black-stem rust' of wheat so it has been extensively grubbed up from its habitats. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Fairly easy[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]. Fairly easy[11]",
