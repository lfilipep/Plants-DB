0,Rheum officinale,Chinese Rhubarb,Polygonaceae,6-9,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves of some if not all members of this genus contain significant quantities of oxalic acid and should not be eaten in any quantity. Oxalic acid can lock up certain minerals in the body, especially calcium, leading to nutritional deficiency. The content of oxalic acid will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",Hills and forest understories at elevations of 1200 - 4000 metres in western China[266].,E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds;,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,Rutin: often used as a food supplement.,"Leaf stem - cooked or raw[177, 178]. Rather medicinal[105]. One report says that the plant contains 1.3% rutin[240]. It does not specify which part of the plant, though it is likely to be the leaves[K].","Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticholesterolemic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Antitumor  Aperient  Astringent  Cholagogue  Diuretic  Stomachic  TonicRhubarb has a long and proven history of herbal usage, its main effect being a positive and balancing effect upon the whole digestive system. It is one of the most widely used herbs in Chinese medicine[218, 238]. The root is anticholesterolemic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, antitumor, aperient, astringent, cholagogue, demulcent, diuretic, laxative, purgative, stomachic and tonic[4, 147, 171, 176, 218, 238]. The roots contain anthraquinones, which have a purgative effect, and also tannins and bitters, which have an opposite astringent effect[244]. When taken in small doses, it acts as an astringent tonic to the digestive system, whilst larger doses act as a mild laxative[232, 244]. The root is taken internally in the treatment of chronic constipation, diarrhoea, liver and gall bladder complaints, haemorrhoids, menstrual problems and skin eruptions due to an accumulation of toxins[238]. This remedy is not prescribed for pregnant or lactating women, nor for patients with intestinal obstruction[238]. Externally, the root is used in the treatment of burns[238]. The roots are harvested in October from plants that are at least six years old, they are then dried for later use[4]. A homeopathic remedy is prepared from the dried root[232]. This is used especially in the treatment of diarrhoea in teething children[232].",,Plants can be grown for ground cover when spaced about 1.8 metres apart each way[208].,,"Prefers a deep, fertile, moderately heavy, humus rich, moisture retentive, well-drained soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is closely related to R. australe[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Cultivated as a medicinal plant in China[61]. Plants at the Cambridge Botanical Gardens in September 1993 were growing well in the shade of a woodland garden, though they were not succeeding when planted closely to the trees[K]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].","Seed - best sown in autumn in a shaded cold frame[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in the spring. Division in early spring or autumn[1, 111]. Divide up the rootstock with a sharp spade or knife, making sure that there is at least one growth bud on each division. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
