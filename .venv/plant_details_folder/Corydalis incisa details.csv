13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Corydalis incisa is a ANNUAL/BIENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."
15,Synonyms,"Fumaria incisa Thunb. (NGRP, 2017), Capnoides incisa Kuntze (The Plant List, 2017). The Plant List (2017) lists additional synonyms at the infraspecific level."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Can be invasive outside its natural range. Corydalis incisa is an annual or biennial, spring-ephemeral herb. Seeds germinate in the spring and develop small rosettes, which wither during the summer. They emerge again as rosettes throughout the winter and produce compact flowering racemes the following spring [1-7].  In its native range in Asia, C. incisa occurs along stream valleys, irrigation channels, and forest margins; in wastelands, roadsides, and forestlands; and on rock walls. In the United States, it grows in mesic and alluvial forest habitats. Under horticultural conditions, C. incisa prefers cooler exposures [1-7]. The known distribution globally has Plant Hardiness Zones 6-10, areas with 20-100+ inches of annual precipitation, and the following Köppen-Geiger climate classes: humid subtropical, marine west coast, humid continental with warm summers, and humid continental with cool summers. There is no evidence that C. incisa occurs in Mediterranean climates. It is potentially suitable because the plants usually are dormant during the summer when conditions are driest in Mediterranean climates [1-7]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a moist, well-drained rather light soil, thriving in semi-shade[1]. Grows well in a woodland garden or peat bed. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, the seed rapidly loses viability if it is allowed to become dry[129]. Surface sow and keep moist, it usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. Germinates in spring according to another report[129]. Two months warm, then a cold stratification improves the germination of stored seed[134, 164]. Seedlings only produce one leaf in their first year of growth[175] and are very prone to damping off[129]. This species is a biennial and probably germinates more easily than the perennial species."
