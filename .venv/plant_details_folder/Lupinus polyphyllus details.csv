0,Latin Name,Lupinus polyphyllus
1,Common Name,"Big-Leaf Lupin, Lupine"
2,Family,Fabaceae or Leguminosae
3,USDA hardiness,5-9
4,Known Hazards,"The seed of many lupin species contain bitter-tasting toxic alkaloids, though there are often sweet varieties within that species that are completely wholesome[65, 76]. Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65]."
5,Habitats,Usually found in wetlands from sea level to 3000 metres[276].
6,Range,Western N. America - British Columbia to California. A garden escape in Britain[17].

21,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Special Features: Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing. Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers. Nitrogen fixer."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Management: Standard  New Crop  Staple Crop: ProteinAn easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. It strongly dislikes excessive winter wet[1]. Requires an acid to neutral soil[200]. Succeeds in poor soils[60]. Plants can be naturalized in the wild garden, especially on stream banks and for flowering above rough grass, where they may be short-lived but will self-seed[200]. Plants dislike root disturbance. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a greenhouse[1, 200]. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. It should also be possible to sow the seed in situ in mid spring. It might be necessary to protect the sowing from mice. Division in March. Difficult. Basal cuttings, April in a cold frame. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
