13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Semiarundinaria murielae is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 4 m (13ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

20,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Tolerant of wind, so long as this is not too cold, the plant makes a good dense shelter hedge[162]. It blankets noise very well. It needs to be planted fairly densely because it does not spread very quickly, 60 - 75cm is a good distance. The canes can be used as plant supports[25].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Minor Global CropPrefers a damp humus-rich soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Prefers light shade[25]. Dislikes drought[1]. A slow growing plant, it prefers a position sheltered from cold north and east winds. A very cold-hardy bamboo, tolerating temperatures down to about -22°c. According to some authorities this species is no more than a form of Thamnocalamus spathaceus[200]. Most leaves are produced at the tops of the stems[200]. The plant has a running rootstock but does not spread far in the cooler climate of Britain and never becomes invasive. Produces its new shoots from late April[25]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could be 2 - 3 years. The plants only flower at intervals of many years and so seed is rarely available. Division as the plants come into growth in spring. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings. Rhizome cuttings.",
