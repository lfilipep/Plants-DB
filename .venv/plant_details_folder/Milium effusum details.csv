24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a fertile moist but well-drained soil[200] in a shady position[162]. Succeeds in dry shade, tolerating drought when established[190]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. Plants are tufted with a short rootstock and are short-lived[187]. They often self-sow[200]. At least one named form has been selected for its ornamental value[187]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in situ[162]. Division in spring. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer."
