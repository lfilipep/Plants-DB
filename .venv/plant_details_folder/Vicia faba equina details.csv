4,Known Hazards,"Although often used as an edible seed, there is a report that eating the seed of this plant can cause the disease 'Favism' in susceptible people[76]. Favism only occurs in cases of excessive consumption of the seed (no more details are given[K]) and when the person is genetically inclined towards the disease[213].",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked[27, 61]. It can be eaten before it is fully ripe in the same way as broad beans, the fully ripe seed requires overnight soaking to soften it before it is cooked. Leaves - cooked[105]. Used like spinach.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps. Does not include the essential oils, dyes and oils that are also used in making soap.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A good green manure crop, sown in autumn or spring. Relatively fast growing, producing a good bulk and fixing nitrogen[87]. The upright growth is not a very good weed suppresser though. A fibre is obtained from the stems. The burnt stems are rich in potassium and can be used in making soap.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fairly heavy loam but succeeds in a sunny position in most soils that are well-drained[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes dry conditions[57]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible seed, more commonly as a green manure crop[87]. There are 2 main types, 'daffa' beans are the more hardy and can be sown in the autumn, whilst 'tic' beans are best sown in spring. The autumn sown varieties are more susceptible to 'chocolate spot' fungus (which can be remedied by the addition of potash to the soil) but are more likely to escape damage from aphis[87]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in spring or autumn.,
