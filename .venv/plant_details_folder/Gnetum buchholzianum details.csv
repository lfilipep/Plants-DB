13,Summary,"Jointfir or Gnetum buchholzianum is an evergreen climbing woody shrub growing about 10m or more from a tuberous rootstock. The dark green leaves are opposite, with narrowly oval leaf blades, rounded base, and 4-8 pairs of strongly curved veins. The branches thickened at the nodes. Jointir is commonly found in western tropical Africa where it is highly valued as a leaf vegetable. The leaves are eaten raw or cooked, or added to sauces. It can also be dried and stored for later use. The tubers, fruits, and seeds are eaten as well. The plant also has medicinal uses. In particular, the leaves are used in the treatment of high blood pressure, constipation, enlarged spleen, piles, sore throat, nausea, warts, and boils. The stem can aid in childbirth.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Gnetum buchholzianum is an evergreen Climber growing to 10 m (32ft) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,"Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"ves - raw or cooked[332 ]. Wherever it occurs in Africa, the leaf is valued as a tasty vegetable, usually eaten finely shredded for addition to soup or made up into condiments, or even taken raw[332 ]. To soften this rather tough vegetable, people often mix it with waterleaf (Talinum triangulare)[299 ]. Shredded leaves can be dried and preserved for later use[299 ]. The leaves have a very high nutritional value and constitute an important source of protein, essential amino acids and mineral elements[401 ]. Leafy stems remain fresh for at least a week after harvesting[299 ]. The dry matter content of the fresh leaves is much higher than for other dark or medium green leaf vegetables. This gives a feeling of firmness during preparation, hence certain consumers consider the leaves as a substitute for meat[299 ]. The leaves of this species are somewhat thicker and darker green than those of the related Gnetum africanum[299 ]. Fruit pulp[332 ]. Seed[332 ]. The mature seed is 15 - 15mm long, enclosed in a somewhat drupaceous orange-tinted envelope. The tubers are sometimes eaten - especially at times of scarcity[401 ]. Climbing members of this genus growing in Asia yield a potable sap[332 ]. This species should also be looked at in this respect[332 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibilious: Corrects the secretions of bile.,Antidermatosic: Prevents or cures skin complaints.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibilious  Antidermatosic  Antidote  Antihaemorrhoidal  Cathartic  HypotensiveThe leaf is used in the treatment of enlarged spleen, sore throat, piles, high blood pressure and as a cathartic[299 , 332 ]. It is eaten as a treatment against nausea and is considered antidotal against arrow-poison based on Parquetina nigrescens[299 , 332 ]. The leaves are chewed to mitigate the effects of drunkenness and they are taken as an enema against constipation[299 ]. Applied externally, the chopped-up leaf serves as a dressing on warts and boils to hasten maturation[332 , 401 ]. The stem is cut up into small pieces and infused to produce a tisane that is taken to ease childbirth and reduce the pain[332 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The stem is supple and strong. It is used as a rope[299 ], made into traps and nooses for catching game, and into straps for porterage[332 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Wild Staple Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Coppice  New Crop  Wild Staple CropA tropical plant. It grows in rainforest from sea level to 1,200 m altitude. It suits humid locations. It does best with a rainfall of 3,000 mm per year. It needs shade. Plants do not grow well in full sun. A plant of humid, lowland tropical rainforests, being found at elevations from sea level to 1,200 metres[299]. It grows best in areas where the annual rainfall is around 3,000 mm[299].Succeeds in dappled shade in the woodland. Plants growing in full sun produce thinner leaves which are not so well liked by consumers[299]. Cultivated plants need to be given some support, such as a tree, to grow into[299].The plant forms two distinct types of stem. Growing up from the base, the stems produce only small, scale-like leaves, and they grow rapidly towards the light. Higher up, side shoots are formed with fully-developed leaves[299].The plant continues to grow during the dry season and new shoots may develop where the stem has been cut or where side shoots have been removed[299]. New shoots are also formed from rhizomes that spread along the forest floor[299].Current methods of harvest from wild stands are very destructive[299]. Controlled harvesting, in which only side shoots or parts of stems are collected, allows new shoots to develop where a stem has been cut or where side shoots have been removed[299]. Preliminary observations indicate that 3 - 4 harvests per year are possible, still allowing for substantial regrowth. More frequent harvesting will result in thin leaves that are considered inferior[299].The first harvest may take place 6 - 9 months after planting. The total lifespan of the plant is estimated at over 10 years[299].Preliminary observation indicates that in cultivation during the first harvest year the fresh leaf yield may reach 20 t/ha. This may double in subsequent years[299].Under wild conditions, the plant grows and forms underground tubers or roots that store plant food reserves. These can remain alive for many years when the vegetation and the plant growth above ground are cleared and the soil surface is laid bare[401].A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required.",
