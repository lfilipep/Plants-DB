24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich moist non-alkaline soil[167]. Shade tolerant, at least when young[200]. This species is hardy to about -25°c, but the plants grow best in humid areas with high rainfall, mild winters and cool summers[200]. They are not really happy in the drier eastern half of the country[11]. Closely related to P. totara[200]. A good plant for the rock garden[200]. Very tolerant of pruning[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed can be sown at any time of the year in a sandy soil in a warm greenhouse, though it is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame[78].",
