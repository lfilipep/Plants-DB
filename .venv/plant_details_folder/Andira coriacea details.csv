Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Other Uses: The heartwood is pink-brown to red-brown with bands of light coloured wood that give it a distinctive figure; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 5cm wide band of sapwood. Texture is coarse; grain straight or interlocked. The wood is heavy, hard, elastic, very durable, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites, and suitable for use untreated in marine environments and brackish water. The wood seasons fairly quickly with only a slight rish of distortion or check; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It has a strong blunting effect upon tools, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it is difficult to get a smooth surface when planing because of the alternate bands of hard and soft wood; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is necessary; gluing is correct on dry wood and smooth surfaces, but is suitable for interior uses only. The wood has a wide range of applications, being suitable for use in salt water. It is used in cabinet making, furniture, construction, interior and exterior joinery and panelling, industrial flooring, turned goods, heavy carpentry etc[ 848 ].",,This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].,Seed.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
