20,Other Uses,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.
21,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Other Uses: The heartwood is pink-brown to red-brown with bands of light coloured wood that give it a distinctive figure; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 5cm wide band of sapwood. Texture is coarse; grain straight or interlocked. The wood is heavy, hard, elastic, very durable, being resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites, and suitable for use untreated in marine environments and brackish water. The wood seasons fairly quickly with only a slight rish of distortion or check; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It has a strong blunting effect upon tools, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it is difficult to get a smooth surface when planing because of the alternate bands of hard and soft wood; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is necessary; gluing is correct on dry wood and smooth surfaces, but is suitable for interior uses only. The wood has a wide range of applications, being suitable for use in salt water. It is used in cabinet making, furniture, construction, interior and exterior joinery and panelling, industrial flooring, turned goods, heavy carpentry etc[ 848 ]."
