4,Known Hazards,"Although no records of toxicity have been seen, some caution should be exercised with this species, particularly with regard to its edible leaves, since it belongs to a family that often contains toxins. However, use of the leaves is well documented and fairly widespread in some areas. The unripe fruit might also be suspect though the ripe fruit is wholesome.",

13,Summary,"Lycium barbarum commonly known as wolfberry and now better known as goji berry is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) at a medium rate. The fruit can be eaten raw or cooked. The fruit is a berry about 2cm in diameter. It has a mild sweet liquorice flavour. Only the fully ripe fruits should be eaten. Young shoots are cooked and used mainly as a flavouring.  They can also be lightly cooked for 3 - 4 minutes and used as a vegetable, the flavour is somewhat cress-like but has also been described as peppermint-like. The leaves wilt rapidly once they have been harvested. The leaves are a tea substitute.Lycium barbarum has been used for centuries in China as a traditional medicinal and food supplement.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Lycium barbarum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105, 146]. The fruit is a berry about 2cm in diameter[200, 206]. A mild sweet liquorice flavour[206]. Only the fully ripe fruits should be eaten[K]. Young shoots - cooked[2, 46, 85, 105]. Used mainly as a flavouring, they can also be lightly cooked for 3 - 4 minutes and used as a vegetable, the flavour is somewhat cress-like but has also been described as peppermint-like[206]. The leaves wilt rapidly once they have been harvested[206]. Some caution is advised, see notes at top of the page. The leaves are a tea substitute[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Tonic: Improves general health.

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Anticholesterolemic  Antipyretic  Cancer  Diuretic  Hypoglycaemic  Ophthalmic  Purgative  Skin  Tonic  VasodilatorA sweet tonic decoction made from the fruits is used to lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels[238]. It acts mainly on the liver and kidneys[61, 176, 238]. The fruit is taken internally in the treatment of high blood pressure, diabetes, poor eyesight, vertigo, lumbago, impotence and menopausal complaints[238]. The fruit is harvested when fully ripe and is dried for later use[238]. The root bark is a bitter, cooling, antibacterial herb that controls coughs and lowers fevers, blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels[61, 176, 238]. It is taken internally in the treatment of chronic fevers, internal haemorrhages, nosebleeds, tuberculosis, coughs, asthma etc[238]. It is applied externally to treat genital itching[238]. The bark is harvested in the winter and dried for later use[238]. Diuretic, purgative, [61, 176]. The plant has a long history of medicinal use, both as a general, energy restoring tonic and also to cure a wide range of ailments from skin rashes and eyesight problems to diabetes[206]. A tonic tea is made from the leaves[206]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].",
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Can be grown as an informal hedge, succeeding in maritime exposure[59, 200]. Plants have an extensive root system and can be planted to stabilize sandy banks[200, 206].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it does not require a rich soil, flowering and fruiting better in a well-drained soil of moderate quality[1, 200]. Succeeds in impoverished soils[200], but more fertile soils are best if the plant is being grown for its edible young shoots[206]. Requires a sunny position[200]. Some plants at Kew are growing well in light shade[K]. Tolerates maritime exposure[11, 49, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[202]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[206]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can regrow from old wood[202]. Any trimming is best carried out in the spring[188]. Plants produce suckers freely and can become invasive when in a suitable position. Otherwise they can be difficult to establish[202]. There is much confusion over the naming of this species. Most, if not all, of the plants being grown as L. chinense or L. europaeum are in fact this species[11]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually good and fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Pinch out the shoot tips of the young plants in order to encourage bushy growth[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel if possible, July/August in individual pots in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, autumn to late winter in a cold frame. High percentage[78, 200]. Division of suckers in late winter. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. Layering.",
