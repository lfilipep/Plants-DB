See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. cajanumensis.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Sweet and juicy, the flavour is said to be like a blend of peach and tomato[196].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Succeeds in a sunny position in any well-drained soil[196]. Prefers a light fertile soil[196]. Dislikes drought[196]. Plants are very prone to wind damage[196]. Plants fruit best with cool temperatures in the growing season[196]. This species is probably not hardy in Britain, but like the related tree tomato it might be possible to grow it outdoors in the summer and bring it into a warmer place for the winter. Plants are probably insensitive to day-length[196]. Very fast growing, it starts to fruit within two years from seed and reaches peak production in 3 - 4 years[196]. Trees are, however, short-lived and start to degenerate after about 8 years[196]. This species could be a valuable source of gene material for qualities such as nematode resistance, root rot resistance, fragrance, flavour, colour and yield[196]. Plants have a shallow spreading root system and resent surface hoeing, they are best given a good mulch[196]. Plants usually ripe their fruit over a period of time, though pruning methods can be used to produce a peak time of fruiting[196]. The leaves have a pungent smell[196]. Plants are subject to attacks by red spider mites.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates within 4 weeks at 15°c[K], within 2 weeks at 25°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.
