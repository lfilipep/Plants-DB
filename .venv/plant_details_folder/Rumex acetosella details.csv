1,Common Name,"Sheeps Sorrel, Common sheep sorrel"
2,Family,Polygonaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."
5,Habitats,"Heaths and acid grasslands[17]. A weed of acid soils[17, 55]."
6,Range,"Cetral and southeastern Europe, including Britain, as far north as Scandanavia and Iceland."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rumex acetosella is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.

A delicious lemon-like flavour, most people consider them too strong to use in quantity, but they are excellent as a flavouring in mixed salads[K]. The leaves should only be used in small quantities due to the oxalic acid content. The leaves can be used as thickeners in soups etc[102], they can also be dried for later use[12]. Root - cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and made into noodles[105]. Seed - raw or cooked[172]. Easy to harvest, but the seed is rather small and fiddly to use[K].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diuretic  Poultice  UrinarySheep's sorrel is a detoxifying herb, the fresh juice of the leaves having a pronounced diuretic effect[254]. Like other members of the genus, it is mildly laxative and holds out potential as a long term treatment for chronic disease, in particular that of the gastro-intestinal tract[254]. The plant is also part of a North American formula called essiac which is a popular treatment for cancer. Its effectiveness has never been reliably proven or disproven since controlled studies have not been carried out. The other herbs included in the formula are Arctium lappa, Ulmus rubra and Rheum palmatum[254]. The whole plant, used in the fresh state, is diaphoretic, diuretic and refrigerant[222]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of fevers, inflammation and scurvy[222]. The leaf juice is useful in the treatment of urinary and kidney diseases[4]. A leaf poultice is applied to tumours, cysts etc, and is a folk treatment for cancer[222].

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[37], preferring a moist moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Although a plant of acid soils, it can tolerate some alkalinity[17]. A good food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies[24, 30], it grows well in the summer meadow[24]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping mat former. Forming a dense prostrate carpet spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]."
