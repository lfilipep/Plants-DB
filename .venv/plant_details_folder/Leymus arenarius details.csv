13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Leymus arenarius is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 2 m (6ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[2, 105]. It can be ground into a flour and used to make bread[13]. A delicious taste[183] but very fiddly to use, the seed is small and hard to extract[K]. When cooked like rice, it can be used as a sweet or savoury dish. Mixed 50/50 with wheat flour it adds a richness to biscuits etc[183]. The protein content of this grain is said to rival that of red beans or salmon[183]. (This report seems somewhat surprising, protein levels are not usually anywhere near that high in a cereal[K].)",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are used for making mats, rope, paper etc[46, 61]. The plants have a very extensive root system and so they are often planted near the coast in order to stabilize sand dunes[190, 200]. They can also be used as a ground cover for sandy open spaces but can be invasive[200, 208].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Wild-collected as Food: Some wild plants have strong historic or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Wild-collected as FoodAn easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, preferring a sandy soil[1] and a sunny position[162]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[190]. A very invasive plant, spreading by means of its wide-ranging roots[1, 187]. Cultivated in Japan for making mats etc[46, 61]. The Viking settlers of Iceland cultivated this plant until the beginning of the 20th century for its edible seed[183].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow mid spring in situ and only just cover the seed[162]. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If the supply of seed is limited, it can also be sown in mid spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in summer[K] Division in spring or summer[162]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
