23,Other Uses Description,"Planted in maritime areas to prevent soil erosion in sandy soils and on steep banks[200, 265]. The plant is moderately fire-resistant and can be used in barrier plantings to prevent the spread of forest fires[200]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained sandy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Plants can be grown on dry walls or in the flower border[166]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Very resistant to wind and salt spray[166]. Moderately fire-retardant[200]. Plants are not very frost resistant, tolerating temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c, and only succeeding outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. A vigorous prostrate plant, rooting as it spreads. The flowers only open in the afternoon[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow March to June in a greenhouse. Lower night-time temperatures are beneficial. The seed usually germinates in 7 - 10 days at 23°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings at any time during the growing season. Allow the cutting to dry in the sun for a day or two then pot up in a very sandy mix. Very easy[K]."
