24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia.

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilSucceeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Requires a light not too fertile soil[11]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[184]. The plants produce flowers and fruits better when they are growing in full sun[200]. Flowers are produced on the previous seasons wood[200] and can be produced in the autumn as well as the spring. The flowers are produced on the current years wood according to another report[182]. Autumn flowers can produce ripe fruit in the following spring. Unfortunately, the plants only produce fruit in Britain after long hot summers[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best if given 2 months cold stratification[113]. Sow the seed in autumn if possible, otherwise in late winter or early spring in a cold frame in light shade. Germination may be inhibited by light[113]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle into individual pots. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113].",
