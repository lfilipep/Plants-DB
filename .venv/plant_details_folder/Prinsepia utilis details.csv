Requires a light not too fertile soil[11]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[184]. The plants produce flowers and fruits better when they are growing in full sun[200]. Flowers are produced on the previous seasons wood[200] and can be produced in the autumn as well as the spring. The flowers are produced on the current years wood according to another report[182]. Autumn flowers can produce ripe fruit in the following spring. Unfortunately, the plants only produce fruit in Britain after long hot summers[200].","Seed - best if given 2 months cold stratification[113]. Sow the seed in autumn if possible, otherwise in late winter or early spring in a cold frame in light shade. Germination may be inhibited by light[113]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle into individual pots. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
