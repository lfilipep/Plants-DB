21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antidiarrhoeal  Antihaemorrhoidal  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Cancer  Digestive  Emollient  NarcoticHound's tongue has a long history of use as a medicinal herb, though it is rarely used in modern herbalism[7, 268]. The leaves contain allantoin, a highly effective agent that speeds up the healing process in the body[238, K]. Caution should be applied, however, since narcotic effects result from large doses taken internally[7] and the plant is potentially carcinogenic[222] (though it has also been used in the treatment of cancer[218]). The leaves and roots are analgesic, antihaemorrhoidal, antispasmodic, astringent, digestive, emollient and slightly narcotic[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 222]. The plant contains the alkaloids cynoglossine and consolidin, which are used medicinally to relieve pain[212]. They depress the central nervous system and are also potentially carcinogenic[222]. The plant has been used internally in the treatment of coughs and diarrhoea, though it is now mainly used externally as a poultice on piles, wounds, minor injuries, bites and ulcers[222, 238]. The root is harvested at the end of spring of the plants second year[7]. Another report says that it is best harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238]. The leaves and flowering shoots are harvested as the plant comes into flower and are dried for later use[238]. The plant has a wide antitumour reputation for cancers of various types[218]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[7]. It is very effective in the treatment of insomnia[7]."
