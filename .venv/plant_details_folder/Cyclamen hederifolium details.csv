Plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in April/May. Very easy, the larger tubers can be planted out straight into their permanent positions whilst it is best to pot up the smaller ones and grow them on for a season before planting them out.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
