26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[133, 134]. Fresh seed germinates in 3 - 6 weeks[133]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water, sow shallowly and keep in a shady position at 15°c[124]. Germination may be slow and erratic[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in April/May. Very easy, the larger tubers can be planted out straight into their permanent positions whilst it is best to pot up the smaller ones and grow them on for a season before planting them out.",
