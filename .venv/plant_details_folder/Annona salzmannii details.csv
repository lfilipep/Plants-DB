This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seeds in individual containers in a lightly shaded position. Germination rates of scarified seeds can above 95%, with the seeds sprouting within 40 - 50 days[ 625 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
