Pre-soak dried seed and sow as early in the year as possible[134]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. Takes one year[78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance[200]. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively.
