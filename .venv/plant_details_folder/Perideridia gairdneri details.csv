It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",Carum gairdneri,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Bog Garden; Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Root - raw or cooked[60, 61]. A pleasant sweet and nutty taste[2, 46, 95, 161], it can be eaten in quantity as a staple food[183]. It is best used when the plant is dormant[85]. The root can also be dried for later use or ground into a powder and used with cereals when making porridges, cakes etc[183]. The seed is used as a caraway-like seasoning, or can be parched and eaten in porridge or used as piñole[85, 177, 183, 257]. Young leaves - raw or cooked[257].","Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

An infusion of the roots has been taken to counter the cathartic and emetic effects of another infusion[257]. An infusion of the roots has been applied as a wash to sores and wounds and also used as a nasal wash to get rid of catarrh[257]. A poultice of the roots has been used to draw inflammation from swellings[257]. The juice of the slowly chewed root is said to be beneficial in the treatment of sore throats and coughs[213, 257].",,Attracts wildlife.,,"We have very little information on the cultivation needs of this plant and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. Judging by its native range it is likely to succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. From its native habitat it is assumed that the plant is fairly tolerant of soil conditions and of sun or shade. Yampa is a marvellous food plant that has been widely used as a staple wild food by native N. American Indians. It is just asking for cultivation in order to improve the root size[85]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Alternatively, sow it in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting out in late spring of the following year. Division may be possible in spring or autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
