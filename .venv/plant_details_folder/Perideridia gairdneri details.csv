24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on the cultivation needs of this plant and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. Judging by its native range it is likely to succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. From its native habitat it is assumed that the plant is fairly tolerant of soil conditions and of sun or shade. Yampa is a marvellous food plant that has been widely used as a staple wild food by native N. American Indians. It is just asking for cultivation in order to improve the root size[85]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Alternatively, sow it in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting out in late spring of the following year. Division may be possible in spring or autumn.",
