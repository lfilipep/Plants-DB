22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Young trees require the dappled shade of the forest, but become more light-demanding as they grow larger[625 ]. Prefers a moist soil[625 ]. A slow-growing plant, even when small[625 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[755 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A germination rate in excess of 50% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 30 - 40 days[625 ]. Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[K ].",
