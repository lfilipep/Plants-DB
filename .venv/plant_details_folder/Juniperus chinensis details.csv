Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Upright or erect, Vase.","Juniperus chinensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",J. sheppardii.

The fruit is used in the treatment of convulsions, excessive sweating and hepatitis[218]. The root is used in the treatment of burns and scalds[218]. The resin, mixed with the resin of Pinus species, is used as a resolvent on tumours[218].","Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.","A number of cultivars are suitable for use as a ground cover, though they are rather slow-growing[208]. They should be spaced about 90cm apart each way[208]. 'Parsonsii' can grow up to 2 metres across, with its branches horizontal to and about 5cm above the ground but never touching the ground[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Screen. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds in chalky soils[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant, succeeding in hot dry positions[200]. A slow growing and rather short-lived tree[185]. The plants produce new growth from early May to the end of August and can make 50cm a year increases in height when young[185]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200]. The crushed foliage has a rather sour resinous scent[185]. Trees are usually dioecious but occasional monoecious trees occur[11]. Male and female flowers are required if fruit and seed is to be produced. Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
