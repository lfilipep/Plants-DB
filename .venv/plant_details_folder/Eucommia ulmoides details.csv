It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Anticholesterolemic  Aphrodisiac  Astringent  Depurative  Diuretic  Hepatic  Hypotensive  Sedative  Tonic  VasodilatorGutta-percha, known as Du Zhong in China, is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218]. It is considered to be an excellent tonic for the kidneys and liver, and is thought to act specifically on the lower part of the body[254]. Much interest has been aroused by Du Zhong's ability to reduce high blood pressure. In a clinical trial involving 119 people, 46% of those treated with the herb showed a significant reduction in blood pressure[254]. However, it seems to have little effect in cases of severe hypertension[254]. The stem bark is analgesic, anticholesterolemic, aphrodisiac, depurative, diuretic, hepatic, hypotensive, sedative, tonic and vasodilator[11, 46, 147, 176, 178, 218, 279]. Its use lowers blood pressure (the stir-fried bark is stronger than raw and a decoction is stronger than a tincture) and reduces the absorption of cholesterol[176]. It is used in the treatment of impotence, frequent urination, lumbago, weakness of the lower part of the body, aching back and knees, hypertension and threatened abortion[176, 254]. The flowers and the fruit are astringent[218].",
22,Other Uses,"Latex: A source of rubber.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A rubber is obtained from the sap, but not in commercially viable quantities[11, 46, 61]. The leaves contain 3% dry weight of gutta-percha, a non-elastic rubber, used for insulation of electrical wires etc[74]. The gutta-percha is found in all parts of the tree and is extracted by alcohol[61, 174]. The wood is used for making Pattens (a type of shoe with raised soles)[178].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: CoppiceSucceeds in any well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun with shelter from cold winds[200]. Prefers a good loamy soil[11]. A fast growing[1] and very cold-tolerant tree, withstanding temperatures down to about -20°c[74]. Trees are commonly cultivated in Russia and China, both for gutta percha and for the medicinal used of the stembark[11, 218]. By using different solvents it is possible to obtain both of these products and the residue is then used for energy production[218]. This species is the only hardy rubber tree that can be grown outdoors in Britain[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stratify stored seed for 3 months at 2°c[113]. Germination is usually good and takes place in the first spring[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11].",
