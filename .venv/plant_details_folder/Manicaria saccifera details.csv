23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The leaves are utilized as thatch and sails[317 ]. This species produces the largest entire leaves of any known palm, and for this reason, as well as on account of their firm and rigid texture, they form the very best and most durable thatch[314 , 768 ]. The leaves are split down the midrib and the halves laid obliquely on the rafters, so that the furrows formed by the veins lie in a nearly vertical direction and serve as so many little gutters to carry off the water more rapidly[314 ]. A well-made thatch will last ten or twelve years, and an indigenous person will often take a week's voyage in order to get a canoe-load of the leaves to cover his house[314 ]. The fibres, obtained from the peduncular bracts of the inflorescences, are used for making caps, bags and mats[46 , 317 , 786 ].",
