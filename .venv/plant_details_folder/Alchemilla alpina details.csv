21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antirheumatic  Astringent  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Febrifuge  Sedative  Styptic  Tonic  VulneraryLady's mantle has a long history of herbal use, mainly as an external treatment for cuts and wounds, and internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and a number of women's ailments, especially menstrual problems[9, 244]. This plant, the alpine ladies mantle, has been shown to be more effective in its actions[238, 268]. The herb is alterative, antirheumatic, astringent, diuretic, emmenagogue, febrifuge, sedative, styptic, tonic and vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 165]. The leaves and flowering stems are best harvested as the plant comes into flower and can then be dried for later use[4]. The fresh root has similar and perhaps stronger properties to the leaves, but is less often used[4]. The plant is rich in tannin and so is an effective astringent and styptic, commonly used both internally and externally in the treatment of wounds[4]. It helps stop vaginal discharge and is also used as a treatment for excessive menstruation and to heal lesions after pregnancy[4, 244]. Prolonged use can ease the discomfort of the menopause and excessive menstruation[268]. The freshly pressed juice is used to help heal skin troubles such as acne and a weak decoction of the plant has been used in the treatment of conjunctivitis[244].",

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 16°c[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on a cold frame for their first winter, planting out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. The divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we find it best to pot them up and keep them in a sheltered position until they are growing away well.",
