24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any soil[1] but prefers a sunny sheltered position in a humus-rich open soil[164]. Keep the plant well watered in the growing season[164]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit in tropical and sub-tropical zones[46, 61], this plant is not hardy in Britain and normally requires greenhouse protection if it is to fruit here[200]. However, it may succeed outdoors as a tender annual in hot summers if given a suitable position and started off early in the greenhouse. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruits are required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a warm greenhouse in pots of fairly rich soil placing 2 - 3 seeds in each pot. The seed usually germinates within 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c[164]. Thin to the best seedling in each pot and grow them on fast, giving occasional liquid feeds. Plant out after the last expected frosts and give the plants some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well.",
