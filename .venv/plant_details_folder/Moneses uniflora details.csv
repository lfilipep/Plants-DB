See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",M. grandiflora. Pyrola uniflora.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Miscellany  PoulticeAn infusion of the dried plant has been used in the treatment of coughs and colds[257]. The plant has been chewed, and the juice swallowed, as a treatment for sore throat[257]. A poultice of the leaves has been used to draw out the pus from boils and abscesses, to draw blisters, to help reduce swellings and also to relieve pain[257].",Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,None known,,"Prefers a moist sandy woodland soil[111, 200] in a cool position with partial shade[1, 11, 200]. Requires a peaty or leafy acid soil that remains moist in the summer[200]. This is a very difficult plant to grow. It requires a mycorrhizal relationship in the soil and therefore needs to be grown initially in soil collected from around an established plant[200]. It is also very difficult from seed as well as being intolerant of root disturbance which makes division difficult[1]. This species is rare decreasing in the wild in Britain. Surviving populations are threatened, usually by commercial forestry[200].","Seed - the only information we have on this species is that it is difficult from seed and germinates infrequently[200]. We would suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. Sow it into soil collected from around an established plant, only just covering the seed, and put the pot in a shady part of a cold frame. Pot up any young seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, once again using soil from around an established plant. Plant out into their permanent positions when the plants are large enough. You should not need to use soil from around an established plant to do this since the soil in the pot will contain the necessary micorrhiza. Division with great care in the spring[1, 111]. Pot up the divisions using some soil from around an established plant, grow on in a lightly shaded part of a greenhouse or frame and do not plant out until the plants are growing away vigorously[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
