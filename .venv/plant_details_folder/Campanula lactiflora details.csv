See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

A very tolerant plant, thriving even when growing in unkempt grassy areas[233]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[200]. Plants tend to be top-heavy and will need supports in windy gardens[233]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Although usually freely set, it is quite difficult to harvest the seed since it is readily dispersed by the plant as soon as it ripens[271]. The plant often self-sows in the garden and, if potted up whilst small, the seedlings usually transplant fairly well[271]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, otherwise surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. Easy[221]. Plants, especially as they grow, resent root disturbance so, as soon as they are large enough to handle the seedlings should be pricked out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. It is generally better to grow the plants on in larger pots than average in order to ensure good root development[271]. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Easy[K]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring. Another report says that it is difficult to divide the thick tenacious roots of mature plants, and that they resent the disturbance[271].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
