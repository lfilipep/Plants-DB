The climate is hot and dry, there are usually 6 to 11 months without rain each year. The mean annual rainfall varies from 250 - 1,000mm, and the mean annual temperature is from 24 - 26c. Prefers a sunny position[ 625 ]. Prefers a light, well-drained soil[ 625 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 625 ]. Plants are quite slow-growing[ 625 ].","Seed - it has a very hard outer layer and germinates much more easily if scarified[ 625 ]. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seeds in individual containers in a lightly shaded position. Germination rates, even of scarified seeds, can be quite low, with the seeds sprouting within 80 - 120 days[ 625 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
