24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position and plenty of moisture in the growing season. Tolerates dry conditions. This is generally a very hardy species, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c, but persistent cold springs make the plant lazy in sending up new canes. It dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts. In warm parts of Britain this plant can reach 6 metres or more in height. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. A running rootstock, the plant does not produce enough new shoots to be invasive but it still wanders about a bit. New shoots appear in late May. It does not reach a good size in cooler climes. Although classed as a species, this is a cultivated form of the true wild species, P. sulphurea viridis. It was the first form seen and named in the west and thereby received specific status.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring.",
