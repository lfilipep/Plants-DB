A common garden weed[17].,"Most of Europe, including Britain, to western Asia and Siberia.",(3 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AegopodiumPodagraria.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AegopodiumPodagraria2.jpg","Aegopodium podagraria. Ground Elder is a vigorous and very invasive perennial, growing about 60cm tall and spreading rapidly by its roots. It is very difficult to eradicate because any small piece of root left in the ground will quickly regrow. Whilst it is occasionally grown as a ground cover in the wilder parts of the garden (shrubs and strong growing bulbs such as some lilies grow very well through it), it really is too vigorous for most other herbaceous species. There is, however, a variegated form of this species that is less invasive and is sometimes grown in the ornamental garden. Ground Elder has a long history of edible and medicinal use; indeed it was cultivated as a food crop and medicinal herb in the Middle Ages. It was used mainly as a food that could counteract gout, one of the effects of the rich foods eaten by monks, bishops etc at this time. The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked and have an unusual tangy flavour which is an acquired taste, although some people like it.","Aegopodium podagraria is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover; Hedgerow;,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 4, 5, 12, 54, 100]. An unusual tangy flavour[183], the majority of people we give it to do not like it[K] although some reports say that it makes a delicious vegetable[244].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Diuretic  Sedative  VulneraryGround Elder has a long history of medicinal use and was cultivated as a food crop and medicinal herb in the Middle Ages. The plant was used mainly as a food that could counteract gout, one of the effects of the rich foods eaten by monks, bishops etc at this time. The plant is little used in modern herbalism. All parts of the plant are antirheumatic, diuretic, sedative and vulnerary[9, 13, 53, 54, 61]. An infusion is used in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis and disorders of the bladder and intestines[9]. Externally, it is used as a poultice on burns, stings, wounds, painful joints etc[9, 268]. The plant is harvested when it is in flower in late spring to mid-summer and can be used fresh or be dried for later use[9, 238]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the flowering plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of arthritis and rheumatism[9].",,"This species makes a good ground cover for semi-wild situations[200].

Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Foundation, Ground cover, Woodland garden.",,"Prefers damp shady conditions[12, 13, 200] but succeeds in most soils[200]. Prefers a well-drained soil, succeeding in sun or shade[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. This species was cultivated in the Middle Ages as a medicinal and food plant[5, 17, 177, 268]. A very invasive plant, spreading freely at the roots[4, 53, 208], though it seldom sets seed in Britain[208]. Once established it can be very difficult to eradicate because any small piece of root left in the ground can regrow[K]. If introducing this plant to your garden, it might be best to restrict the roots by growing the plant in a bottomless container buried in the soil[238]. There is a variegated form of this species that is less invasive and is sometimes grown in the ornamental garden[208]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].
