13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Corylus americana is a deciduous Tree growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Oil: "
19,Edible Uses Description,"d - raw or cooked in soups, bread, biscuits, sweets etc[63, 101, 183]. The nuts have a thick shell with a small sweet kernel[183], they make an excellent dessert[K]. Although smaller than the seeds of cultivated species, the seed is of the same general quality[270]. Nuts at the 'milk' stage (before they are fully ripe) are softer and sweeter[183]. The seed is rich in oil. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed,"
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  PoulticeA tea made from the bark is astringent[222]. It was used in the treatment of hives and fevers[222, 257]. A poultice made from the bark is used to close cuts and wounds, treat tumours, old sores etc[222, 257]."
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses."
23,Other Uses Description,The plant makes a good screening hedge[159].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils including chalk, but is in general more productive of seeds when grown on soils of moderate fertility[11, 200]. It does well in a loamy soil[11, 200]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. This species is cultivated in America for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[61, 183]. This species is of little value in Britain, however, rarely bearing seeds[11]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in early spring. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
