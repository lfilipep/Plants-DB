It grows at least 6 m tall. Flowers and fruits are bright red in colour and form into dense clusters. Oil obtained from the pulp is used against rheumatism and dandruff, to promote hair growth and to repel insects. The plant produces two types of oil used as cooking oil, and for making margarine, ice cream, soaps, detergents, shampoos, etc. - palm oil (from the fruit) and kernel oil (from the seeds)."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Elaeis oleifera is an evergreen Tree growing to 4 m (13ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

The oil can be applied to the body as an insect repellent[ 739 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil)."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of the lowland, moist tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 510 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30°c, but can tolerate 14 - 34°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 8°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,400 - 2,500mm, but tolerates 700 - 3,500mm[ 418 ]. Plants grow well in full sun, even when small[ 297 ]. Requires a humus-rich, well-drained soil, but is not fussy as to soil type[ 297 , 314 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.3[ 418 ]. A slow growing tree[ 418 ]. Plants can commence bearing just 3 years after the seed has germinated[ 297 ]. The plant produces both male and female flowers, but not usually at the same time. An individual inflorescence will be all male or all female flowers; after a series of inflorescences of one sex the plant will then produce a series of inflorescences of the opposite sex[ 768 ]. Spacing: 15-20 ft. (4.7-6 m) 20-30 ft. (6-9 m)."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - pre-soak 24 hours in warm water and sow in containers. Germination takes place in 2 - 5 months[ 297 ].
