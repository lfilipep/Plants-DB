In the early 1950s E. binata represented about 22% of the total fibrous material pulped in India, but in recent years its use for pulp production has decreased because of limited supply. Plantations have been established to increase production.","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually.
