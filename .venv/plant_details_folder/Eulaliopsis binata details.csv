20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Useful for erosion control[317 ]. Other Uses: The grass is woven into mats, light shoes etc[46 , 317 ]. The plant is a good source of fibre, which is widely used for making sails, ropes and string[46 , 266 ]. The fibre is suitable for papermaking[46 ]. Pulping is performed under alkaline conditions, and the pulp is often mixed with short-fibred pulps from hardwoods or from agricultural waste material such as rice straw. In the early 1950s E. binata represented about 22% of the total fibrous material pulped in India, but in recent years its use for pulp production has decreased because of limited supply. Plantations have been established to increase production."
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
23,Cultivation Details Description,Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Regional CropE. binata occurs in grassland up to 1400 m altitude. It thrives on well-drained sandy loams with an annual rainfall of 750-1500 mm.
24,Plant Propagation,Propagation is best by rootstock division; seedlings raised in nurseries may also be used.
