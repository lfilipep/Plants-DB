Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a deep very well-drained fertile sandy soil in a sunny position and must be kept rather dry from when the bulb flowers until late winter[1, 90, 200]. This is a rather difficult plant to cultivate in Britain, it is very cold hardy but is intolerant of wetness especially in the winter[1, 90]. It is easiest to grow in a bulb frame but is worth trying outdoors at the base of a south-facing wall, especially with shrubs that like these conditions[120]. It should not be crowded by other plants[214]. Bulbs can be lifted as soon as the foliage dies down in the summer and stored overwinter in a cool dry place, replanting in spring[138]. Another report says that they should be replanted immediately[1]. Bulbs frequently divide after flowering, the bulblets taking 2 years to reach flowering size[200]. Hand pollination is necessary if seed is required[1].","Seed - sow as soon as ripe or early spring in a cold frame in a very sharply draining medium. Stratification may be helpful for spring-sown seed, though this species usually germinates within two months without any treatment[120]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Leave the seedlings undisturbed for their first two years growth[138], but give them an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. It is quite difficult to get the seedlings through their first period of dormancy since it is all too easy either to dry them out completely or keep them too moist when they will rot[214]. After their second year of growth, pot up the dormant bulbs in late summer and grow them on for at least another 2 years in the greenhouse before trying them outside. Seedlings take about 5 - 7 years to come into flower[214]. Division of the bulbs as soon as the foliage dies down. One report says that the bulbs must be planted into their permanent positions immediately[1], whilst another says that they can be stored overwinter and replanted in the spring[138]. Stem bulbils, harvested from the stems after flowering. Can be stored cool and dry then planted in pots in the cold frame in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
