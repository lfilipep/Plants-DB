See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower in September, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","he following notes are for the closely related H. syriacus. They quite probably also apply to this species[K]. Young leaves - raw or cooked[2, 177, 179, 183]. A very mild flavour, though slightly on the tough side, they make an acceptable addition to the salad bowl[K]. A tea is made from the leaves[2, 177, 240] or the flowers[183]. Flowers - raw or cooked[74, 105, 183]. A mild flavour and mucilaginous texture, they are delightful in salads, both for looking at and for eating[K]. Root - it is edible but very fibrousy[144]. Mucilaginous, without very much flavour[144].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A decoction of the flowers is diuretic, ophthalmic and stomachic[147, 218]. It is also used in the treatment of itch and other skin diseases[240], dizziness and bloody stools accompanied by much gas[147]. A decoction of the root bark is antiphlogistic, demulcent, emollient, febrifuge, haemostatic and vermifuge[218, 240].

They quite probably also apply to this similar species[K]. A low quality fibre is obtained from the stems. It is used for making cordage and paper[74]. The seed contains about 25% oil[74]. No further details are given, but it is likely to be edible. A hair shampoo is made from the leaves[74]. A blue dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. This species is planted as a hedge in S. Europe[50].",,"Prefers a well-drained humus rich fertile soil in a sheltered position in full sun[200]. Succeeds in any soil of good or moderate quality[11]. Dislikes shade or badly drained soils[11]. Plants grow best with their roots in cool moist soil and their tops in a hot sunny position. Plants are hardy in most parts of the country, tolerating temperatures down to around -15°c[200]. They are best grown in the milder areas, however, because of their habit of flowering late in the season and thus being subject to frost damage[200]. When planted in colder parts of the country they will need some protection for the first few winters[200]. This species is closely related to H. syriacus, differing mainly in the larger leaves and larger epicalyx[200]. Plants rarely require pruning[219], though they respond well to pruning and trimming and this is best carried out in the spring or just after flowering[219]. The flowers are produced on the current season's growth[200]. and they only open in sunny weather[219]. Plants are late coming into leaf, usually around the end of May or early June[182]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[11].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Some reports say that the seed can be sown in situ outside and that it gives a good rate of germination[78, 80, 113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, early autumn in a frame. Good percentage[113]. Layering in mid summer to early autumn[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
