The young tender leaves are mild and make an excellent salad[183, 217], but the whole plant becomes bitter as it gets older, especially when coming into flower[K]. As a potherb it needs very little cooking[183]. Large quantities can cause digestive upsets[62]. Young shoots - cooked. Used as an asparagus substitute[13]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[46, 61, 105]. The oil must be refined before it is edible[114].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antipyretic  Diuretic  Homeopathy  Hypnotic  Narcotic  Sedative  UrinaryThe whole plant is rich in a milky sap that flows freely from any wounds. This hardens and dries when in contact with the air[4]. The sap contains 'lactucarium', which is used in medicine for its anodyne, antispasmodic, digestive, diuretic, hypnotic, narcotic and sedative properties[9, 21, 46, 165, 192, 213, 238]. Lactucarium has the effects of a feeble opium, but without its tendency to cause digestive upsets[4], nor is it addictive[7]. It is taken internally in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, neuroses, hyperactivity in children, dry coughs, whooping cough, rheumatic pain etc[238]. Concentrations of lactucarium are low in young plants and most concentrated when the plant comes into flower[238]. It is collected commercially by cutting the heads of the plants and scraping the juice into china vessels several times a day until the plant is exhausted[4]. This species does not contain as much lactucarium as L. virosa[4]. An infusion of the fresh or dried flowering plant can also be used[9]. The plant should be used with caution, and never without the supervision of a skilled practitioner. Even normal doses can cause drowsiness whilst excess causes restlessness[238] and overdoses can cause death through cardiac paralysis[7, 9]. The fixed oil from the seeds is said to possess antipyretic and hypnotic properties[240]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of chronic catarrh, coughs, swollen liver, flatulence and ailments of the urinary tract[9].","Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The seed contains 35.2% of a semi-drying oil[240].
