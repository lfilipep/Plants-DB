Asia - China to the Himalayas.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Half Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Parthenocissus himalayana is a deciduous Climber growing to 18 m (59ft 1in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Ampelopsis himalayana.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; East Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. A juicy texture with a sweet to acidic flavour[194]. The average yield per plant is about 750g per year[194]. (This seems exceedingly low[K].) The fruit contains about 8.6% sugars, 2.9% protein, 1.4% ash. Vitamin C content is 12.2mg per 100ml of juice[194]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200] and is carried in small bunches like grapes.",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Vitamin CNone known,,"Plants can be allowed to sprawl on the ground, making a good ground cover when spaced about 3 metres apart each way[208]. They are very vigorous, however, and would soon swamp smaller plants[K].",,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive fertile soil and a sunny position[200]. Succeeds in semi-shade[208]. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain, it succeeds in the milder areas of the country where it is best grown on an east or west facing wall[200, 219]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Fruits are only produced after a long hot summer[219]. The fruit of this species is very late ripening and the plant has potential in breeding programmes with Vitis vinifera, especially in the Himalayas, where this trait could be useful[194]. A climbing plant, supporting itself by means of adhesive tendrils[182, 219]. A very good climber for walls but it can invade gutters[182].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires stratifying for 6 weeks at 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Germination is variable. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm taken at a node (ensure that it has at least 2 true buds), July/August in a frame[78]. Easy to root but they do not always survive the first winter[182]. Basal hardwood cuttings of current seasons growth, 10 - 12 cm long, autumn in a frame[200].
