The seeds have a high amount of fat and give a good cocoa butter[317 ]. The seeds of species in this genus are generally a rich source of oil (around 50%), starch (around 15%) and protein (around 15%)[636 ]. They also contain a volatile oil and the stimulating alkaloids caffeine and theobromine[636 ].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30°c, tolerating 16 - 40°c[636 ]. It requires a mean annual rainfall within the range 2,000 - 8,000mm, evenly distributed throughout the year[636 ]. Requires a position where shade is provided by taller trees[420 ]. Prefers a relatively rich, circumneutral soil[636 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[418 ]. The plant is not drought tolerant, being unable to withstand even short dry seasons without the protection of dense shade and local humidity[636 ]. Freshly planted young trees usually grow away moderately well[420 ]. A seedless variety of this species exists[416 ].","Seed - it has a very short viability, requiring high humidity and optimum temperatures to remain viable. There is no dormancy, the seed often germinating whilst still inside the pod[636 ]. Sow the seed as soon as it is ripe, in a semi-shaded position in individual containers[420 ]. Cover with about 15mm of soil. Germination rates of fresh seed is usually high, with sprouting taking place in 20 - 40 days[420 ]. Young plants are usually ready for planting out 5 - 6 months later[420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
