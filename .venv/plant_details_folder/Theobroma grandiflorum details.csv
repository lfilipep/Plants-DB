25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the hot, moist, lowland tropics[636 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30°c, tolerating 16 - 40°c[636 ]. It requires a mean annual rainfall within the range 2,000 - 8,000mm, evenly distributed throughout the year[636 ]. Requires a position where shade is provided by taller trees[420 ]. Prefers a relatively rich, circumneutral soil[636 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[418 ]. The plant is not drought tolerant, being unable to withstand even short dry seasons without the protection of dense shade and local humidity[636 ]. Freshly planted young trees usually grow away moderately well[420 ]. A seedless variety of this species exists[416 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a very short viability, requiring high humidity and optimum temperatures to remain viable. There is no dormancy, the seed often germinating whilst still inside the pod[636 ]. Sow the seed as soon as it is ripe, in a semi-shaded position in individual containers[420 ]. Cover with about 15mm of soil. Germination rates of fresh seed is usually high, with sprouting taking place in 20 - 40 days[420 ]. Young plants are usually ready for planting out 5 - 6 months later[420 ].",
