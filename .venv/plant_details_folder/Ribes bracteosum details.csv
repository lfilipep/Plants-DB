See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 85, 101, 118]. Not very palatable[200]. The fruit can cause stomach upsets if eaten in large quantities[257]. The fruit has a mild blackcurrant flavour, though it is not so juicy, has a mealy texture and a slight bitterness[K]. It ripens in September and is acceptable in small quantities raw[K], it can also be used in pies, preserves etc and makes an excellent jam[177, 183, 257]. It can be dried and stored for winter use[177, 183]. Native North American Indians considered the fruit to be constipating and so would eat it with oil[256]. The fruit is about 5mm in diameter[200], it is produced on long racemes, making it much easier to harvest than most currants[K].","Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Requires a sunny position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so they should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The fruit is produced on long sprigs and is therefore easier to harvest[119]. It is being used in modern breeding programmes for blackcurrants[119].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at 2 to 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
