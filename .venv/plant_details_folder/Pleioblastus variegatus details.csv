See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Arundinaria variegata.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,A useful ground cover plant in the right situation[195],,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils[25] but prefers a good loamy soil in a sheltered position in semi-shade[1]. Requires deep shade[25] and a position sheltered from cold northerly and easterly winds[11]. Dislikes drought[1]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c. The leaf margins wither in winter to give a variegated effect. An aggressive spreading plant and very difficult to eradicate[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing.","Seed - if possible, surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Stored seed should be sown as soon as it is received. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse or cold frame until they are large enough to plant out, which could be a number of years. The plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
