See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.","Bromus pratense (Huds.) Spreng. Festuca americana (Pers.) F. Dietr. Festuca apennina De Not. Festuca arctica Schur.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"F. pratensis has been valued for centuries as a pasture grass in temperate regions. It is more cold tolerant than Festuca arundinacea, although it is not as productive. Animal feed, fodder, forage. Environmental: Erosion control or dune stabilization. Genetic importance: Gene source. An ornamental grass [1-8]. Faunal Associations: Insects that feed on Fescue grasses (Festuca spp.) include caterpillars of the skipper Atalopedes campestris (Sachem), larvae of the moth Pediasia trisecta (Larger Sod Webworm), Camnula pellucida (Clear-winged Grasshopper), Oulema melanopus (Cereal Leaf Beetle), Sphenophorus parvulus (Bluegrass Billbug), Blissus leucopterus hirtus (Hairy Chinch Bug), Metopolophium dirhodum (Rose-Grass Aphid), Rhopalosiphum oxyacanthae (Apple-Grass Aphid), Tetraneura ulmi (Elm & Grass Root Aphid), and other aphids. Horses, cattle, and other hoofed farm animals graze on the foliage of Meadow Fescue. The seeds of Meadow Fescue are eaten by the Greater Prairie Chicken. Meadow Fescue collapses into sprawling mats of vegetation during the winter, which probably provides good cover for voles and other small rodents [1-6].",,"A perennial grass growing 30-120cm high. It can be erect or spreading [1-4]. Ranging from Boreal Moist to Rain through Subtropical Dry Forest Life Zones, meadow fescue is reported to tolerate annual precipitation of 3.2 to 13.6 dm, annual temperature of 4.3 to 21.1?C, and pH of 4.5 to 8.2 (Duke, 1978, 1979). Adapted to cool climates as a cool-season turfgrass. Thrives in deep rich soil, but also grows well on calcareous or sandy soils provided they are moist. In native areas, found in meadows, forest margins, thin forests (Reed, 1976). In Pakistan it grows at about 2,000 m altitude. In Sichuan and Yunnan [1-4]. Flowering from June until August in the Northern Hemisphere. US Forest Service (2016) records that it is tolerant of acid soils but may also occur in calcareous soils. Although it survives regular mowing, this grass prefers unmowed or little-mowed areas [1-6].","Slow to establish, this grass requires a clean seedbed. Propagated from sown at a rate of 11?28 kg/ha. Optimum temperature for germination, 20?30?C. In mixtures with clovers sown 9?13 kg/ha; with alfalfa, 3 kg/ha. Combines well with clovers, Lotus corniculatus, alfalfa and grasses, as Phleum pratense and Dactylis glomerata, producing a large proportion of leafy bottom growth (Reed, 1976).",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
