It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from December to March. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils.

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[177]. A watery flavour[272]. The fruit is quite tasty raw, but it is small and rather fiddly to harvest[K]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200].",

22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"A good ground cover plant for shady positions[208]. A carpeting plant that roots as it spreads, it should be spaced about 60cm apart each way[208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but not boggy humus rich soil in shade or semi-shade[182]. A peat and moisture loving species, it requires a lime-free soil[182] and a sheltered position[11]. This species only tolerates light and short-lived frosts, so it is not very hardy in Britain. It can, however, be grown outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. This species does not often fruit well in Britain[188]. Our single plant flowered freely when less than 3 years old from seed, producing quite a few fruits[K]. The bruised leaves have a distinct cedar-like aroma[245]. The flowers are also aromatic[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. Pre-chill for 4 - 10 weeks and surface sow in a lime-free compost in a shady part of the greenhouse and keep moist[78]. The seed usually germinates well, usually within 1 - 2 months at 20°c, but the seedlings are liable to damp off. Watering them with care and making sure they get ample ventilation will reduce this risk. Watering them with a garlic infusion can help to prevent damping off[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are about 25mm tall and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. The seedlings are susceptible to spring frosts and so it might be wise to give them some protection in their first spring or two outdoors.. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 3 - 6cm long, July/August in a frame in a shady position. They form roots in late summer or spring[78]. A good percentage usually take. Division in spring just before new growth begins. 'Drop' the plants 12 months earlier by digging them up and replanting them deeper in the soil so that the branches are buried and can form roots. This works best in a sandy soil[78]. It is best to pot up the divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse until they are established. Plant them out in the summer. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",
