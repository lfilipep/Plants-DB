22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges."
23,Other Uses Description,The cultivar 'Green Mound' makes a good dwarf hedge[182]. Plants can be grown as a tall ground cover when spaced about 2 metres apart each way[208]. The cultivars 'Aureum' and 'Pumilum' are smaller growing and should be spaced about 1 metre apart[208].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore. Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. This species succeeds on poor soils[11]. Does well in shade though it does not fruit so well in such a position[11]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[184]. A number of named varieties have been developed for their ornamental value. The flowers are sweetly fragrant[208]. Plants are dioecious. At least one male plant must be grown in the vicinity of up to 5 females if fruit is required. Plants can harbour a stage of white pine blister rust, so should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at 0 - 9°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200]."
