20,Other Uses,"Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included."
21,Other Uses Description,"A high-class paper is made from the bark[46, 51, 272]. The bark fibres are used. This species is said to be the best of the various species that are used to make hand made paper in the Himalayas[146]. The stems are extremely supple and can be tied in knots[11]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any soil in sun or part shade, growing well in light woodland. Prefers a well-drained soil with plenty of moisture in the growing season. Very closely related to and scarcely distinct from E. chrysantha and E. papyrifera[200]. This species is more tender than E. chrysantha[11]. It is reliably hardy to about -5°c, but it can tolerate temperatures down to -15°c if growing in a well-drained soil in a sheltered position[200]. The flowers are damaged by frost so the plant is best grown on a south or west-facing wall[188]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be put into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. This species is cultivated in the Himalayas for the paper that can be made from the bark[46]. The stems are harvested every second year for this purpose[61]. The flowers diffuse a pronounced clove-like perfume and will scent the air to some distance on a calm day[245]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Place the pot in a plastic bag to keep it moist[175]. The seed might germinate in the spring, though it could take another 12 months. Stored seed usually requires 8 - 12 weeks warm stratification at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c[175]. Germination can still take 12 months or more at 15°c[175]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and grow on in a greenhouse for at least a year before planting out in late spring or early summer[175]. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings in spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]."
