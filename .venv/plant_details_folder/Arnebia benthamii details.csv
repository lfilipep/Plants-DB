When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. It is best to harvest the seed when it is slightly under-ripe, since it is quickly dispersed when ripe[200]. Cuttings with a heel in the autumn in sand in a cold frame[1]. Root cuttings in sand in a frame during the winter[1]."
