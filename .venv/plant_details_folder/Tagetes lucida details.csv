24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils and in sandy soils[188]. Plants in general are not very cold-hardy when grown outdoors in Britain, though some forms will survive outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. We have plants grown from seed collected in Oregon that have proved hardy to at least -5°c[K]. A very ornamental plant, there are some named varieties. 'Huichol' is a traditional clone used by the Huichol Indians that grows at an elevation of 1500 - 1800m in Mexico[183]. The blooms are amongst the most sweetly-scented of all flowers[245]. Removing dead flowers before the seed is formed will extend the flowering season[188]. Plants are prone to slugs, snails and botrytis[188]. Grows well with tomatoes[20]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Remove young shoots when about 5 - 10 cm tall, making sure to get as much of the underground stem as possible. Pot up into a sandy soil and keep in light shade until roots are formed, which usually takes 2- 3 weeks."
