0,Rumex scutatus,"Buckler-Leaved Sorrel, French sorrel",Polygonaceae,5-9,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Old walls and mountain pastures[17, 244].",Europe. Occasionally naturalized in Britain[17].,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexScutatus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexScutatus2.jpg",,"Rumex scutatus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Ground Cover; East Wall.

A delicious lemon-like flavour[183], most people find them overpowering if used in quantity, but they make a delightful addition to the salad bowl and can also be used as a pot-herb[K]. This species has less acid leaves and so is often preferred to sorrel (R, acetosa)[238]. The leaves should be used sparingly due to the oxalic acid content[4].","Antiscorbutic: A plant rich in vitamin C that is used to counteract scurvy.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiscorbutic  Astringent  Diuretic  Laxative  RefrigerantThe leaves are antiscorbutic, astringent, diuretic, laxative and refrigerant[4, 238]. They are rarely used as a specifically medicinal plant.",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"The cultivar 'Silver Shield' makes a good, if rampant, ground cover beside paths and at the front of borders[238]. Although no specific mention has been made for this species, dark green to brown and dark grey dyes can be obtained from the roots of many species in this genus, They do not need a mordant[168]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.",,"A very easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils but preferring a moist moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Prefers a rather dry soil[4, 27]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Plants often self-sow freely in the garden[K]. Buckler-leafed sorrel is occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves[61, 105]. There are some named varieties that have been selected for their ornamental value[238]. A food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterfly[30]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is rapid, the seedlings can be pricked out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and are planted out in early summer[K]. It should also be possible to sow the seed in situ in mid spring[K]. Division in spring. Division is easy at any time in the growing season, though the plants establish better in the spring[K]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
