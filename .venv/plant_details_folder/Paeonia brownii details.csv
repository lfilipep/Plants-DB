See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root.

A decoction has been used by some native North American Indian tribes in the treatment of pneumonia, tuberculosis, VD, nausea, indigestion, coughs, diarrhoea and kidney troubles[207, 257]. A decoction of the sun-dried roots has been used to help people put on weight[257]. A decoction of the root has been used as a liniment on swellings[257]. An infusion of the root has been used as a wash for sore eyes[257]. A powder of the dried and ground root can be used as a dressing on cuts, wounds, burns and sores[257]. A poultice of the crushed roots has been used to treat boils, deep cuts and wounds[257]. A cold infusion of the seeds has been used as a cough medicine[257]. A tea made from the dried crushed petals of various peony species has been used as a cough remedy, and as a treatment for haemorrhoids and varicose veins[250].",Beads: Used as necklaces etc.,The seeds can be used as beads in necklaces etc[257].,,"Requires a deep rich soil, preferably neutral or slightly alkaline[1], doing quite well in sun or light shade[1, 200]. Plants are tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, but will not survive if the soil becomes waterlogged or is too dry[250]. This species requires an extremely well-drained soil[250]. This species is lime tolerant[200]. Plants grown on sandy soils tend to produce more leaves and less flowers, whilst those growing on clay take longer to become established but produce better blooms[250]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[250]. A long-lived plant, specimens can survive in the garden for at least 50 years[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A very greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. Strongly resents root disturbance, taking some time to recover after being divided[1]. Peony species are usually self-fertile, though they will also hybridise with other species if these flower nearby at the same time[250]. Plants take 4 - 5 years to flower from seed[200]. They generally breed true from seed[1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[250]. When sown fresh, the seed produces a root about 6 weeks after sowing with shoots formed in the spring[200]. Stored seed is much slower, it should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame but may take 18 months or more to germinate[200]. The roots are very sensitive to disturbance, so many growers allow the seedlings to remain in their pots for 2 growing seasons before potting them up. This allows a better root system to develop that is more resilient to disturbance[250]. If following this practice, make sure you sow the seed thinly, and give regular liquid feeds in the growing season to ensure the plants are well fed. We usually prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and then grow them on in a cold frame for at least two growing seasons before planting them out when they are in growth in the spring[K]. Division with great care in spring or autumn. Each portion must have a leaf bud. If the lifted root is stood in shade for several hours it becomes less brittle and easier to divide[200]. Divisions that have several buds will usually flower in the second year, but those that only have one or two buds will take a number of years before they have grown sufficiently to flower[250].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
