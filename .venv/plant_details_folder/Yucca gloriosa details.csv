2,Family,Agavaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,6-11,
4,Known Hazards,"The roots contain saponins[222]. Whilst saponins are quite toxic to people, they are poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass straight through. They are also destroyed by prolonged heat, such as slow baking in an oven. Saponins are found in many common foods such as beans[K]. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",

14,Physical Characteristics,"Yucca gloriosa is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 1.2 m (4ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Hand.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. The fruit is up to 10cm long and 26mm wide[229]. The fruit is very rarely produced in the wild[82]. Flowers - raw or cooked. They are delicious raw, and can also be dried, crushed and used as a flavouring[164]. Flowering stem - cooked and used like asparagus[164]. Root - cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and made into a bread[105].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Detergent: A cleansing agent, used on wounds etc. It removes dead and diseased matter.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Detergent  PurgativeThe fruit is purgative[240]. The root is detergent[240].,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making cloth, ropes, baskets and mats[46, 61, 82, 169]. The roots are rich in saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[82].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropLandscape Uses:Massing, Specimen. Thrives in any soil but prefers a sandy loam and full exposure to the south[11]. Plants are hardier when grown on poor sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[190]. Judging by its native habitat, this plant should tolerate maritime exposure[K]. Very cold hardy, tolerating temperatures down to at least -15°c[200], or to -25°c according to another report[187], but plants are subject to injury and decay by winter damp and snow[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are some named varieties[187]. Plants do not flower every year, requiring hot summers to initiate flowering[190]. The flowers are produced in the autumn and are often damaged by early frosts[233]. The scent of the flowers is most pronounced at night[245]. In the plants native environment, its flowers can only be pollinated by a certain species of moth. This moth cannot live in Britain and, if fruit and seed is required, hand pollination is necessary. This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. Individual crowns are monocarpic, dying after flowering[233]. However, the crown will usually produce a number of sideshoots before it dies and these will grow on to flower in later years[233]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].  Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. It usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some winter protection for at least their first winter outdoors - a simple pane of glass is usually sufficient[K]. Seed is not produced in Britain unless the flowers are hand pollinated. Root cuttings in late winter or early spring. Lift in April/May and remove small buds from base of stem and rhizomes. Dip in dry wood ashes to stop any bleeding and plant in a sandy soil in pots in a greenhouse until established[78]. Cuttings can be made of the tops of old plants. These normally root quite easily in the growing season[11].,
