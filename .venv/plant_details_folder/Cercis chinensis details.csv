24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils and pH types, but dislikes growing in wet soils, especially when these are of clay[200]. Prefers a deep damp sandy loam and a very sunny position[11, 182]. Dislikes drought[200]. Repays generous treatment[11]. Although the dormant plant is cold-hardy, the young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. This species does not flower very freely in Britain. Plants do not thrive at Kew, they prefer a hotter climate[11]. The flowers are produced on the branches of the previous or earlier years, and also on the trunk of the plant[82]. Plants are susceptible to coral spot fungus, especially in areas with cooler summers where the wood is not fully ripened[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Resents root disturbance, plants should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in May, and should be kept well watered until established[11]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water then cold stratify for 3 months[113]. Sow spring in the greenhouse[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted out in their permanent positions as soon as possible[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]."
