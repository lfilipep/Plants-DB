Succeeds in most soils and situations[42]. Likes plenty of moisture whilst in growth, followed by a warm dry period in late summer to autumn[200].

A very ornamental plant[2], it can flower in 2 years from seed[138].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring in a cold frame[138]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. Sow the seed thinly so that it will not require thinning and grow the seedlings on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Pot up the small bulbs when they are dormant in early autumn and grow them on for at least another year before planting them out when dormant in the autumn. Seedlings are prone to damping off, they should be watered with care and given plenty of ventilation[138]. Division in autumn[188]. Dig up the clumps of corms when they are dormant, divide them and replant the larger corms into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up the smaller corms and grow them on for a year in a cold frame, planting them out in late summer or the autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
