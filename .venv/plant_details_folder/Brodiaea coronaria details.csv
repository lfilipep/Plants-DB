19,Edible Uses Description,"Corm - raw or cooked[105, 161, 177]. Baked or boiled and eaten like potatoes[257]. When slowly roasted, it becomes very sweet[95]. Edible fruit[2]. This report is rather dubious and possibly refers to the seedpod since the seed is encased in a small dry capsule[K].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich sandy loam and a well-drained soil in a sheltered position[1, 188]. Succeeds in most soils and situations[42]. Likes plenty of moisture whilst in growth, followed by a warm dry period in late summer to autumn[200]. Plants may require protection in severe winters[1], they are susceptible to rot in wet winters[200]. They die down in the summer after flowering[188]. A very ornamental plant[2], it can flower in 2 years from seed[138].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring in a cold frame[138]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. Sow the seed thinly so that it will not require thinning and grow the seedlings on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Pot up the small bulbs when they are dormant in early autumn and grow them on for at least another year before planting them out when dormant in the autumn. Seedlings are prone to damping off, they should be watered with care and given plenty of ventilation[138]. Division in autumn[188]. Dig up the clumps of corms when they are dormant, divide them and replant the larger corms into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up the smaller corms and grow them on for a year in a cold frame, planting them out in late summer or the autumn.",
