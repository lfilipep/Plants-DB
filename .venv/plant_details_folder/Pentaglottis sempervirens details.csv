24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist humus rich soil in light dappled shade or full shade[200] but also succeeds in full sun. Hardy to at least -10°c[187]. Plants can self-sow to the point of nuisance[187]. The tap-root is brittle and resprouts readily making eradication difficult[187]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant out in late spring. Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it can be sown in spring in situ. Division or root cuttings in spring[200]."
