13,Summary,"Perennial sunflowers have protein and oil-rich seeds. Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1]. Several perennial sunflowers are being worked with including prairie natives handling boreal to warm temperate semi-arid conditions: Helianthus maximliani (Maximilian sunflower), Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke), Helianthus pauciflorus (Stiff sunflower). Less tolerant of boreal conditions but good on poor soils is Helianthus cusickii ( Cusick's sunflower) [1-1].",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Helianthus pauciflorus is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.",
