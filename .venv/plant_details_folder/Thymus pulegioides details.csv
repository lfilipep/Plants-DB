See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall.

They can be used as an ingredient of the herb mix 'bouquet garni', or added to soups, vegetables etc, going particularly well with mushrooms or courgettes[238]. If the leaves are to be dried, the plants should be harvested in early and late summer just before the flowers open and the leaves should be dried quickly[200].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Deodorant: Masks smells. Is this medicinal?,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Deodorant  Disinfectant  ExpectorantThe leaves, and especially the essential oil contained in them, are antiseptic, deodorant, disinfectant and expectorant[200, 222, 238].

Succeeds in dry soils. Grows well between stepping stones on paths, tolerating light treading[183, 200]. Succeeds on walls. Thymes dislike wet conditions, especially in the winter. A layer of gravel on the soil around them will help protect the foliage from wet soils[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -10°c[238]. This is a very difficult genus taxonomically, the species hybridize freely with each other and often intergrade into each other[200]. There are many named forms selected for their ornamental value[183]. The leaves are highly aromatic[200]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are very attractive to honey bees[200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed can also be sown in autumn in a greenhouse. Surface sow or barely cover the seed. Germination can be erratic. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
