See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",R. tenuiflorum.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 11, 62, 101, 257]. They make an acceptable dessert fruit[K] and are also used in jellies, sauces and pies[183]. The fruit can also be dried for winter use[46, 85]. Fairly large and flavourful[85, 183]. The fruit is about 5mm in diameter[200]. Flowers - raw. A very sweet flavour[85].","Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiinflammatory  SalveThe dried and pulverized inner bark has been sprinkled on sores[257]. A decoction of the inner bark has been used in the treatment of leg swellings[257].,,None known,,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11]. Succeeds in full sun but is also quite tolerant of shade though not fruiting so well in such a position[11]. Grows well on exposed dry sites[85]. Very tolerant of being transplanted[85]. Plants can spread by means of underground rhizomes, especially when growing in moist conditions[164]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. The fruit can be red, black, yellow, golden or reddish-brown[164]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is closely allied to R. odoratum[11]. Plants can harbour a stage of white pine blister rust, so should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at -2 to +2°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
