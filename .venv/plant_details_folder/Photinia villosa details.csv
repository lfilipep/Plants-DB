Stored seed will probably require stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible[78]. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in a frame[200]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 78]. They take about 2 months to root and should be overwintered in a greenhouse, planting out in late spring[78]. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe side shoots, 7 - 12cm with a heel, October/November in a cold frame[78]. Lift the following autumn and plant in their permanent positions[78].
