24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good moist soil with its roots in the shade and its top growing into the light[200]. Succeeds even in quite deep shade[219]. Tolerates both acid and alkaline soils, only showing distress on very alkaline soils[202]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[202]. Plants are moderately fast-growing[202]. They climb by twining around other plants[182]. The flowers are very fragrant, especially of a night time in order to attract pollinating moths, and are produced in abundance[202, 219, 245], but plants only produce fruit after a hot summer[202]. Plants are prone to attacks by mildew and blackfly[202]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn[200]."
