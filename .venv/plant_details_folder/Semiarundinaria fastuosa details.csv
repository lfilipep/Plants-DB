13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Semiarundinaria fastuosa is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 7.5 m (24ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."
15,Synonyms,Arundinaria fastuosa. A. narihira. Bambusa fastuosa. Sasa fastuosa.

17,Edible Parts,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[25, 61, 177]. The shoots are almost free of any acridity[183]. Although small, they are of good quality when cooked[183]. A plant at Trebah gardens in Cornwall was producing a good amount of new shoots about 35mm in diameter in early April 1995[K]. They are best harvested as they come through the soil in spring[183]. Do not take too many from any plant since this will weaken the clump."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants."
23,Other Uses Description,The plant is fairly resistant to maritime exposure and makes a good shelter hedge[K]. A hedge seen in 1987 in an exposed position at Rosewarne in N. Cornwall was looking good even after the severe winter of that year[K]. It needs to be planted fairly closely if a thick hedge is wanted quickly since it is a slow spreader. 60 - 75cm is a good distance. The canes can be used as plant supports[25].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a damp humus-rich soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Dislikes drought[1]. A slow growing plant, it prefers a position sheltered from cold north and east winds[25] but is fairly tolerant of maritime exposure[K]. A very ornamental and hardy bamboo[195], tolerating temperatures down to about -22°c[25, 200]. Most leaves are produced at the tops of the stems[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The plant has a running rootstock but is slow moving and generally well behaved in the British climate. New shoots are produced from late April[25]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could be 2 - 3 years. The plants only flower at intervals of many years and so seed is rarely available. Division as the plants come into growth in spring. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings. Rhizome cuttings."
