Agroforestry Uses: The plant is considered to be a formidable enemy of trees in India, where it has been known to completely smother the tree into which it has grown for support[ 372 ]. It is of use on rocky or disturbed and bare slopes, where its can quickly clothe the ground and its large leaves protect the soil from erosion[ 146 ]. Other Uses A good quality fibre is obtained from the inner bark. It can be made into very strong ropes[ 287 , 317 , 454 ]. It is used for sewing straw mats with the fresh bark[ 454 ]. It can be cut in all seasons; the outer bark is stripped off and thrown away, the inner coating being used for ropes, as wanted, by being previously soaked in water and twisted when wet[ 454 ]. Before being used, the bark is boiled and beaten with mallets, which renders it soft and pliable for being made into ropes and string for charpoys[ 454 ]. The stems are used for matting, basketry and wickerwork[ 310 ]. The leaves are utilized for thatching and making umbrellas[ 317 ]. The large flat leaves are sewn together and used as plates, cups, rough tablecloths, umbrellas, cloaks, and rain capes[ 668 ]. A gum exudes copiously from the tree[ 668 ]. Of little value[ 146 ]. The bark contains up to 17% tannins[ 287 , 310 ]. The tannin cannot be extracted easily, but is of very good quality[ 310 ].",,"Grows best in a sunny position[ 200 ].

The plant grows back quickly from the base when it is cut down, and has been known to produce new growth of 15 metres within 12 months[ 146 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
