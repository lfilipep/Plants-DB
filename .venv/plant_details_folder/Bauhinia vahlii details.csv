It is of use on rocky or disturbed and bare slopes, where its can quickly clothe the ground and its large leaves protect the soil from erosion[ 146 ]. Other Uses A good quality fibre is obtained from the inner bark. It can be made into very strong ropes[ 287 , 317 , 454 ]. It is used for sewing straw mats with the fresh bark[ 454 ]. It can be cut in all seasons; the outer bark is stripped off and thrown away, the inner coating being used for ropes, as wanted, by being previously soaked in water and twisted when wet[ 454 ]. Before being used, the bark is boiled and beaten with mallets, which renders it soft and pliable for being made into ropes and string for charpoys[ 454 ]. The stems are used for matting, basketry and wickerwork[ 310 ]. The leaves are utilized for thatching and making umbrellas[ 317 ]. The large flat leaves are sewn together and used as plates, cups, rough tablecloths, umbrellas, cloaks, and rain capes[ 668 ]. A gum exudes copiously from the tree[ 668 ]. Of little value[ 146 ].

Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].",
