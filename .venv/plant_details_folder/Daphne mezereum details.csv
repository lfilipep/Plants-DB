21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antiseborrheic  Cancer  Cathartic  Diuretic  Emetic  Homeopathy  Rubefacient  Stimulant  VesicantMezereum has been used in the past for treating rheumatism and indolent ulcers, but because of its toxic nature it is no longer considered to be safe[238]. The plant contains various toxic compounds, including daphnetoxin and mezerein, and these are currently being investigated (1995) for their anti-leukaemia effects[238, 254]. The bark is cathartic, diuretic, emetic, rubefacient, stimulant and vesicant[4, 7, 9, 21, 46]. The root bark is the most active medically, but the stem bark is also used[4]. It has been used in an ointment to induce discharge in indolent ulcers[4] and also has a beneficial effect upon rheumatic joints[254]. The bark is not usually taken internally and even when used externally this should be done with extreme caution and not applied if the skin is broken[4, 21, 254]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[7]. The fruits have sometimes been used as a purgative[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[7]. It is used in the treatment of various skin complaints and inflammations[7, 9].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow to greenish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, fruit and bark[13]. The seed contains up to 31% of a fatty oil[74]. No further details are given.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Specimen. A good sandy loam suits most members of this genus[11]. Prefers a good heavy soil and some shade[31, 49]. Prefers a calcareous soil[13, 17, 19] and cool moist conditions[11, 49]. There is no evidence to suggest it requires a calcareous soil, but all members of this genus do well on acid soils[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -30°c[184]. Plants tend to be short-lived in cultivation, probably due to excessive seed bearing[11, 200]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. They also resent being cut and so should not be pruned unless it is essential[245]. A good bee plant, providing a source of nectar very early in the year[108]. The flowers have a delicious sweet perfume[245].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Layering.",
