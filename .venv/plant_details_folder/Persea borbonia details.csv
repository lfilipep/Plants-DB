21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Analgesic  Antirheumatic  Appetizer  Emetic  FebrifugeRed bay was widely employed medicinally by the Seminole Indians who used it to treat a variety of complaints, but especially as an emetic and body cleanser[257]. It is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. The leaves are abortifacient, analgesic, antirheumatic, appetizer, emetic and febrifuge[257]. An infusion can be used to abort a foetus up to the age of four months[257]. An infusion is also used in treating fevers, headaches, diarrhoea, thirst, constipation, appetite loss and blocked urination[257]. A strong decoction is emetic and was used as a body purification when treating a wide range of complaints[257]. A decoction of the leaves is used externally as a wash on rheumatic joints and painful limbs[257]."
22,Other Uses,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.
23,Other Uses Description,"- hard, heavy, close-grained, very strong, rather brittle[82, 229, 235]. It weighs 40lb per cubic foot[235]. The wood works well and is suitable for interior uses such as cabinets, but trees with large straight trunks are not sufficiently common to make the tree of commercial interest[229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Seashore, Specimen, Street tree. We have found no cultivation details for this species in Britain, though the tree is likely to require a well-drained light to medium soil in a sunny sheltered position[K]. It is only likely to be hardy in the mildest areas of the country[11].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Fragrant foliage, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 8. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. An evergreen."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first 2 winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors.
