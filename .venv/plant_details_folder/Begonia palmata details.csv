Plants are probably not winter hardy outdoors in Britain, though they are worth trying in a sheltered woodland position in the milder areas of the country."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse and keep the compost moist in a light position. The seed can be very slow to germinate, sometimes taking a year or more[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division Basal cuttings from tubers in spring."
