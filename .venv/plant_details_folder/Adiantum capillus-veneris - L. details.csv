3,USDA hardiness,8-11,
4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].",

The plant is little used in modern herbalism. The fresh or dried leafy fronds are antidandruff, antitussive, astringent, demulcent, depurative, emetic, weakly emmenagogue, emollient, weakly expectorant, febrifuge, galactogogue, laxative, pectoral, refrigerant, stimulant, sudorific and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 61, 218, 222, 240, 268]. A tea or syrup is used in the treatment of coughs, throat afflictions and bronchitis[222]. It is also used as a detoxicant in alcoholism[7] and to expel worms from the body[222]. Externally, it is used as a poultice on snake bites, bee stings etc[218, 222, 257]. In Nepal, a paste made from the fronds is applied to the forehead to relieve headaches and to the chest to relieve chest pains[272]. The plant is best used fresh, though it can also be harvested in the summer and dried for later use[7, 9].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Woodland garden. Requires an abundance of moisture in the air and in the soil[4], though the soil should be well-drained[238]. Likes a position with plenty of light but dislikes full sun[1]. Prefers a sheltered shady position[238]. If the plant dries out temporarily it will lose most of its fronds, though it will usually resprout from the base[238]. Plants are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, even though they are a native species[K]. They only succeed in areas with little or no frosts, growing well on maritime cliffs in the milder areas of the country[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, There are no flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Spores - best sown as soon as ripe on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Germination should take place within 6 weeks[238]. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and keep humid until they are well established. Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position. Division in spring or autumn. Best carried out in early spring[238].",
