24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Requires full sun and a sheltered position[182, 200]. A fairly hardy plant[1], but it does not succeed outdoors at Kew, the soft pithy shoots being cut back by winter cold[11]. It grows well in Gloucestershire[11, 182]. This species is closely related to A. chinense[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200]. Users feedback: I collected the seeds in late summer, stored them at a dark and dry location and followed a normal stratification procedure from November till January (November and January at around 2 °C, December at around -12 °C, all in my fridge). Germination appears to start at the earliestafter three weeks, how long it usually takes I will know in a couple of weeks (it's just one early bird that broke through the surface today).Luckily, no trickery is required: it's sufficient to clean them up, soak them in water before and after stratification and pop them intothe moist soil.
