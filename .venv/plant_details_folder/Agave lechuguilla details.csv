Lechuguilla provides important habitat and food to a diversity of Chihuahuan Desert mammals, reptiles, and birds but is poisonous to domestic livestock.","Agave lechuguilla is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.","Agave poselgeri, Agave multilineata, Agave lophantha var. tamaulipasana, Agave lophantha var. subcanescens, Agave lophantha var. poselgeri.",,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,,"The water stored in the flowering stalks of this plant, rich in salts and minerals, is sold in Mexico as a sport drink.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles). Agroforestry Services: living fence (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland). This species is mainly used in the fabrication of brushes and scrubbers (NatureServe 2009); the leaf fibres are used to make ropes (SpottedBird 2000). Utilization of lechuguilla fibers, soaps, foods, and drinks by southwestern people (US) was extensive historically and continues today. Lechuguilla fibers called ""istles,"" Ixtili, or Tampico are strong and durable. Fibers were used to make ropes, twine, sacks, saddle cloths, basketry, paint brushes, sandals, hair brushes, and when formed into a cord was used in clothing construction. Lechuguilla nectar attracts hummingbirds, wasps, bees, butterflies, and beetles.","Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropClimate: subtropical to tropical. Humidity: arid to humid. Lechuguilla is common on dry hills, plains, rocky slopes, and limestone highlands. Lechuguilla occupies habitats with semiarid continental climates. The Chihuahuan Desert averages 7.7 to 13.7 inches (196-348 mm) of annual precipitation, and summer temperatures above 100 °F (40 °C) are common. In the northern portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, precipitation averages 9.7 to 10.4 inches (245-265 mm), 70% to 80% of which falls in the summer. The average low winter temperature is 36 °F (2 °C) and mean summer high is 90 °F (31 °C). Throughout lechuguilla's range, the densest populations occur below 4,900 feet (1,500 m). Lechuguilla is shallowly rooted. The average depth is 4 inches (10 cm). It produces flowers after three to five years and dies after flowering. Threatened by deer and javelinas (peccaries) who eat it, however, it is poisonous to cattle. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Propagation from offshoots is the fastest and most reliable method of agave plant production.  Agave are difficult to grow from seed. Seeds readily germinate but seedling establishment is rare. Temperatures exceeding 95 °F (35 °C), however, decrease germination percentages.  The lack of ""specialized germination requirements"" may limit lechuguilla's ability to establish by seed.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
