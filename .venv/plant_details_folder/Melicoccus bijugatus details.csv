24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 600 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 30°c, but can tolerate 13 - 34°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -3°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 800 - 1,600mm, but tolerates 500 - 2,700mm[418 ]. Prefers a fertile, well-drained soil in a sunny position[307 ], though it can also succeed in poor soils[335 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 5 - 8.7[418 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[307 , 335 ]. Plants can withstand the strongest salt-laden winds[307 ]. Seedling plants take 7 - 10 years to begin fruiting[307 , 335 ]. Cuttings can fruit in 4 - 5 years[335 ]. The flowers are pleasantly scented and attract bees[447 ]. There are some named varieties[301 ]. Trees are intolerant of pruning[307 ]. Some members of this species are hermaphrodite, whilst others can be dioecious[307 ]. Most forms are dioecious, in which case it is necessary to grow both male and female forms if fruit and seed are required[335 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring Mid  SSpring. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: 20-30 ft. (6-9 m)."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - seedlings often do not fruit as well as their parent[200 ]. Air layering. Greenwood cuttings. Grafting.
