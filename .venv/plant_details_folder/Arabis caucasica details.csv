Form: Spreading or horizontal.,"Arabis caucasica is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to May, and the seeds ripen from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",A. albida.,Ground Cover; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall.

Easily grown in ordinary well-drained soil[1]. Prefers a poor soil[187]. Succeeds in partial shade[134] though it tends to become straggly[197]. Established plants are very tolerant of drought and grow very well on a dry bank[190], they also succeed when grown in walls[219, K]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -15°c[187], but can be rather invasive[200]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[187]. A good butterfly and moth plant[30]. Bees are attracted to the flowers. Plants resent root disturbance and are best put in their final positions whilst still small[134]. This species is closely related to A. alpina[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].","Seed - it is best to surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a light position in a cold frame[134]. Seed can also be sown in spring. It usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks at 21°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division after flowering[111]. Very easy, the divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions if required. Cuttings in a shady border in summer[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
