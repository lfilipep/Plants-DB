24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1] including dry ones according to one report[190] whilst others say that it requires a deep moist fertile soil in a sunny position[111, 200]. Established plants are drought resistant[190]. This species is hardy to about -10°c, possibly lower if the rootstock is mulched in the winter[187]. A very ornamental plant[1], though the flowers have a most unpleasant rancid smell[245]. Plants are often monoecious[187]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance due to their long taproot[200]. They should be planted into their final positions as soon as possible. The sub-species brevifolia is the form used for its gum[1, 46, 61, 100]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as the seed is ripe in a greenhouse in autumn[1]. Otherwise sow in April in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Plant them out into their permanent positions whilst still small because the plants dislike root disturbance[1]. Give the plants a protective mulch for at least their first winter outdoors. Division in autumn. This may be inadvisable due to the plants dislike of root disturbance.
