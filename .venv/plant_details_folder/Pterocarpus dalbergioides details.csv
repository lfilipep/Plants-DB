It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 32°c, but can tolerate 15 - 37°c[418 ]. Plants are not tolerant of frost. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 3,000 - 3,500mm, but tolerates 2,500 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position, tolerating light shade[418 ]. The tree is shade tolerant in youth[418 ]. Succeeds in most soils[418 ]. The tree is best adapted to damp conditions[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].",Seed -,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
