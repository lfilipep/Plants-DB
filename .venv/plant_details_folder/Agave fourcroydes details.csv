20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plants are cultivated as hedges and living fences in Cuba[317 ]. Other Uses A fibre is obtained from the leaves[317 ]. Coarser than the fibres from sisal (Agave sisalana), they are used for the production of ropes, nets, floor-covering and harvest binding strings[317 ]. The roots contain saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[331 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropA plant of the drier tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 30c, but can tolerate 10 - 40c[418 ]. It can be damaged by temperatures of -5c or lower[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 900 - 1,250mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position in a well-drained soil. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5, tolerating 6 - 8[418 ]. It require 4 - 6 years to first harvest, and the leaves can subsequently be harvested twice a year[418 ]. A monocarpic species - the plant lives for a number of years without flowering but dies once it does flower. However, it normally produces plenty of suckers during its life and these continue growing, taking about 10 - 15 years in a warm climate, considerably longer in colder ones, before flowering[11 ]. In Mexico the plant has a life cycle of 15 - 30 years[418 ]. This species is a sterile hybrid taxon[317 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"One source suggests Agave fourcroydes is like sisal, a sterile hybrid; the ovaries never produce seeds. The plant does produce bulbils that may be planted, but commercial growers prefer to use the frequent suckers, which develop more quickly.",
