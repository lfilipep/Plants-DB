Other Uses A fibre is obtained from the leaves[317 ]. Coarser than the fibres from sisal (Agave sisalana), they are used for the production of ropes, nets, floor-covering and harvest binding strings[317 ]. The roots contain saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[331 ].","Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropA plant of the drier tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 30c, but can tolerate 10 - 40c[418 ]. It can be damaged by temperatures of -5c or lower[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 900 - 1,250mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position in a well-drained soil. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5, tolerating 6 - 8[418 ]. It require 4 - 6 years to first harvest, and the leaves can subsequently be harvested twice a year[418 ]. A monocarpic species - the plant lives for a number of years without flowering but dies once it does flower. However, it normally produces plenty of suckers during its life and these continue growing, taking about 10 - 15 years in a warm climate, considerably longer in colder ones, before flowering[11 ]. In Mexico the plant has a life cycle of 15 - 30 years[418 ]. This species is a sterile hybrid taxon[317 ].","One source suggests Agave fourcroydes is like sisal, a sterile hybrid; the ovaries never produce seeds. The plant does produce bulbils that may be planted, but commercial growers prefer to use the frequent suckers, which develop more quickly.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
