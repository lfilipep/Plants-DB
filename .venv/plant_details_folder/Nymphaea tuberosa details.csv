The bitter tasting tuber is occasionally eaten[105, 159, 177, 183]. The bitterness can be reduced somewhat by leaching the root in water."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Anodyne  Antiseptic  Astringent  Demulcent  DysenteryThe following notes are the medicinal uses of N. odorata. It is said that this species can be used interchangeably[238]. The root is alterative, anodyne, antiseptic, astringent and demulcent[4, 21, 165, 238]. A tea made from the roots is used in the treatment of TB, chronic bronchial complaints, diarrhoea, dysentery, gastrointestinal inflammation, gonorrhoea, vaginal discharge, inflamed glands, mouth sores and to stop bleeding[222, 238]. A poultice made from the roots is used in the treatment of swellings, boils, tumours, inflamed skin, vaginitis etc[222, 238]. The roots are harvested in the autumn once the plant has died down, and are dried for later use[238]. A complete cure of uterine cancer by a decoction and uterine injection has been recorded[4]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A water plant requiring a rich soil and a sunny position in still or slowly moving water[56, 200]. Succeeds in water from 30 - 120cm deep[200]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. There are two basic types of plant in this genus (this species is a crawler):- 'crawlers' are species with horizontal roots that often spread freely, with new plants being formed at intervals along the root. These species are useful for naturalising, but they do not flower very freely in the cool summers of Britain[214]. 'clumpers' have vertical roots, they form slowly spreading clumps and produce offsets around the crown. These forms flower much more freely in Britain[214]. The flowers have a fruity perfume like that of ripe apples[245]. The variety rosea is more strongly fragrant[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse in pots submerged under 25mm of water. Prick out into individual pots as soon as the first true leaf appears and grow them on in water in a greenhouse for at least two years before planting them out in late spring. The seed is collected by wrapping the developing seed head in a muslin bag to avoid the seed being lost. Harvest it 10 days after it sinks below the soil surface or as soon as it reappears[200]. Division in May. Each portion must have at least one eye. Submerge in pots in shallow water until established[56].
