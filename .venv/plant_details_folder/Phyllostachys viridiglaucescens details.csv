13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Phyllostachys viridiglaucescens is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 6 m (19ft) by 7 m (23ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[61, 105, 177]. Virtually free of acridity even when raw[195], they are eaten in salads or added to soups etc[183]. The shoots on mature clumps can be 40mm or more in diameter[K]. Another report says the shoots are acrid when raw. The shoots are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The canes are used as plant supports etc[61, 195].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position[200] and plenty of moisture in the growing season[200]. Plants are very hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[195], but they dislike prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. Plants can reach 10 metres in height in the warmer parts of Britain. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. A very ornamental plant, it will in time form a clump 7 or more metres in diameter so it is best grown in an isolated position[11]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. The rootstock is running[25], it is not too invasive in the cooler British climate[200] but can wander a little. New shoots appear from early April[25]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring.",
