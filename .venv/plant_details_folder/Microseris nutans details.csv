The plant is very variable in the wild[60]. See the plants native habitat for ideas on its cultivation needs."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring might be possible."
