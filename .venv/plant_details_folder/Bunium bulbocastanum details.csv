24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"See the plants native habitat for ideas on its cultivation needs. The pig nut has at times been cultivated for its edible root[61]. Although quite small in the wild, there is a potential to improve the size of this root through selective breeding and cultivation. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seedlings only have one cotyledon[17]. Germination is usually free and quick, prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow on for their first season in pots. Plant them out into their final positions when dormant in the autumn. The seed can also be sown in situ, but this is best done only if you have lots of seed since far fewer plants will result. Division in spring or autumn."
