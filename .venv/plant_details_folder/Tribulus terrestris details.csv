The stems are used in the treatment of scabious skin diseases and psoriasis[218]. The dried and concocted fruits are used in the treatment of congestion, gas, headache, liver, ophthalmia and stomatitis[218].",,None known,,We have very little information on this species and are not sure how successful it will be in Britain. There are conflicting reports on its hardiness - according to one report it is native to N. France which should make it hardy in Britain[50] whilst another report says that it is only hardy in zone 10 which means that it is not frost tolerant[200]. We would suggest treating it as a frost tender annual and then experimenting with its hardiness. It is likely to require a well-drained dry to moist soil and is also likely to be tolerant of maritime exposure. The plant is very fast growing from seed[50].
