25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep fertile well-drained but moisture-retentive soil in a sunny position but with some shade at the hottest part of the day[200]. Hardy to at least -15°c, but where prolonged cold spells without snow cover are experienced it is best to apply a good mulch of bracken in the winter[200]. Plants thrive in climates with relatively cool summers and mild winters[200]. If the plants are cut back immediately after flowering they will produce a second flush of flowers in late summer[200]. Plants are sometimes infested with rust, Puccinia malvacearum[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200].",
