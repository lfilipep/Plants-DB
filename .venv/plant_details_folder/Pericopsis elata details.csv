It grows about 50 m tall and up to 130 cm in trunk diameter. The trunk is often straight, cylindrical, and blunt buttressed. There is no known edible part of this plant. Several plant parts, however, are used medicinally such as the bark, leaves, and wood. The wood is highly valued as material for making furniture, veneer, joinery, construction, agricultural implements, musical instruments, toys, etc. It is considered as one of the four most important timbers in Congo.","Pericopsis elata is a TREE growing to 40 m (131ft) by 30 m (98ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Afrormosia elata Harms,,None known,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antibiotic  Hypoglycaemic  Malaria  ParasiticideThe pulped bark is rubbed into scarifications as an anodyne[299 ]. Methanol extracts of the leaves showed moderate in-vitro antiplasmodial activity against multi-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum[299 ]. The wood contains stilbene derivatives with antibiotic, antimalarial and blood-sugar reducing properties[299 ].","Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses The heartwood is yellowish brown to greenish brown with darker streaks, turning dark brown upon exposure; it is fairly distinctly demarcated from the up to 3cm wide band of pale yellow-brown sapwood. The texture is moderately fine; the grain is straight, sometimes interlocked. The wood is moderately heavy; hard; very durable, but may occasionally be attacked by marine borers. It seasons slowly, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately to poorly stable in service, It saws and works well with both hand and machine tools, although the blunting effect is fairly high and stellite-tipped saw teeth and tungsten-carbide-tipped cutting tools are recommended; it has a smooth finish; usually planes well, but sometimes with a slight picking up due to the presence of interlocked grain; it polishes satisfactorily, but the use of a filler is recommended; it is liable to splitting when nailed, but it holds nails and screws well; gluing does not pose problems when it is done carefully to prevent staining; the bending properties are moderate; it turns satisfactorily. Under moist conditions, the wood often stains dark where it is in contact with iron. The wood resembles that of teak, though it lacks the oily texture, and is highly valued on the international market. It is used mainly for high grade furniture and as decorative veneer, but also for interior and exterior joinery, stairs, flooring and boat building. It is also suitable for heavy and light construction, railway sleepers, vehicle bodies, interior trim, handles, ladders, agricultural implements, sporting goods, musical instruments, toys, novelties, boxes, crates, carvings, turnery and draining boards[299 , 848 ].",,"A plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 35°c, but can tolerate 20 - 40°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,300mm, but tolerates 750 - 1,500mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils, preferring one of low fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7, tolerating 6 - 8[418 ]. Initial growth may be rapid in suitable conditions, with 7 year old trees 8 metres tall with a bole diameter of 9cm and 16 year old trees 26 metres tall[299 ]. Plantation trials in Cote d'Ivoire showed growth rates up to 20cm in bole diameter in 20 years[299 ]. Seedlings are usually found close to mother trees, up to a distance of 35 metres, indicating that the non-dehiscing pods are spread over only short distances, although they may occasionally be spread over longer distances by strong winds[299 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].","Seed - germination of fresh seed is very rapid, usually within 8 days, both in deep forest shade and in the dappled shade of small gaps in the forest, but the seedlings only develop in the gaps and die in the deep shade[299 ]. In full sunlight the germination rate is very low, only about 5%[299 ]. Localities where seedlings receive full sunlight in the morning but which are shaded from direct midday sun have been recorded as ideal for seedling growth[299 ]. The seedlings are remarkably drought tolerant and can be found on wet as well as dry forest soils[299 ]. Sowing tests showed that seedlings grow best when the seeds have been covered with 15mm of soil[299 ]. In experiments, propagation by stem cuttings showed good results[299 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
