21,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Carex species are popular in horticulture especially for shady positions. No information was found for Carex morowii but some Carex native species are used in wildland habitat restoration projects, natural landscaping, and in sustainable landscaping as drought-tolerant grass replacements for lawns and garden meadows. Grows well in the shade of trees. Carex morrowii is typically grown for its attractive shape and foliage. Effective accent for smaller gardens. Can be grown in pots."
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Regional CropClimate: boreal to warm temperate. Humidity: aquatic. Best grown in moist, fertile, medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. In full sun and hot sites foliage tends to bleach to an unattractive yellow. Tolerates: Deer, Heavy Shade, Erosion, Wet Soil. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. ."
