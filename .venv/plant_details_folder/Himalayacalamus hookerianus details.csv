13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Himalayacalamus hookerianus is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 9 m (29ft 6in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked whole or ground into a powder and used as a cereal[214]. Plants flower at intervals of about 50 years, they flower and produce fertile seed abundantly in British gardens[214]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"The older stems are harvested for weaving into baskets and mats[214]. The canes can be up to 3cm in diameter and, with the long gaps between nodes, produce a high-quality weaving material[220, 272]. A very effective plant for stabilising soil on steep slopes[267]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil[214]. Succeeds in most soils so long as they do not dry out[200]. Dislikes drought[1]. Prefers a position sheltered from cold north and east winds[1]. The stems colour more brightly when grown in a sunny position[200], though the leaves curl up in bright sunlight[214]. Succeeds outdoors in a woodland garden in the milder parts of Britain[214]. Plants are intolerant of winter wet and of temperatures below about -6°c[200]. Plants are flowering freely (1993) in Kew and Edinburgh where they are producing abundant fertile seed[214]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. There has been much confusion over this species and many plants cultivated under this name have proved to be different species[214]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. There is a degree of dormancy in the seed and it can take 1 - 8 months to germinate at 20 - 25°c, a cold pre-treatment might shorten this time[214]. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings."
