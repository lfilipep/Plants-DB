24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil, preferring one that is rich in humus[1, 200]. Prefers semi-shade and a sheltered position[1, 15]. Does well in woodland conditions[166]. This species is only hardy in the mildest parts of Britain[11, 48], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c when fully dormant. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. It grows well outdoors in Cornwall and along the west coast of Scotland[59, 184]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[108]. A very unusual plant in that its pollen is bright blue[173].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K].",
