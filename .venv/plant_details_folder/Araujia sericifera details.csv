24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil but succeeds in any fertile soil[11, 182]. Requires a sunny position[182]. Plants are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, they succeed outdoors only in the mildest areas of the country[1, 11]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Plants produce fruit when growing on a wall at Glendurgan gardens in Cornwall[59]. A very vigorous twining plant when growing in a suitable position[182, 219]. The flowers have a very strong scent that can be offensive if approached too closely[219]. This scent attracts night-flying moths who are seeking nectar, but the flowers are designed in such a way as to trap the moths by their tongues until morning when those who have survived the ordeal can escape[200, 219]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. The seed can be sown at any time of the year if the greenhouse is heated[134]. Germinates in 3 - 6 weeks at 20°c according to one report whilst another says that it takes 1 - 6 months at 25°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, late autumn in a frame[1]."
