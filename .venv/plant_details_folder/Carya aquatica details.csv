See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf from June to October, in flower from April to May. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Juglans aquatica.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - raw or cooked. Astringent[177]. The seed is up to 35mm long, it is produced in clusters of 3 - 4 and has a thin shell, but the kernel is very bitter[11, 82, 229]. The seed ripens in late autumn and, when stored in its shell in a cool place, will keep for at least 6 months[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It weighs 46lb per cubic foot and is used mainly in fencing and as a fuel, where it yields considerably more heat than most woods[229, 235].",,"Prefers a deep moisture-retentive loam in a sunny sheltered position, requiring a good summer for best development[1, 63, 137, 200]. A slow growing tree[200], it does not begin bearing seed until more than 20 years old[229]. Most species in this genus have quite a wide range of distribution and, in order to find trees more suited to this country, seed from the most appropriate provenances should be sought[137]. Most trees growing in Britain at present tend to only produce good seed after hot summers[137]. Carya aquatica hybridizes with C . illinoinensis ( C . × lecontei Little) and is reported to hybridize with the tetraploid C . texana [ C . × ludoviciana (Ashe) Little][270]. Plants are strongly tap-rooted and should be planted in their permanent positions as soon as possible[1, 137]. Sowing in situ would be the best method so long as the seed could be protected from mice[1, 200]. Trees are late coming into leaf (usually late May to June) and lose their leaves early in the autumn (usually in October)[137]. During this time they cast a heavy shade. These factors combine to make the trees eminently suitable for a mixed woodland planting with shrubs and other trees beneath them[137]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Trees are self-fertile but larger crops of better quality seeds are produced if cross-pollination takes place[229].","Seed - requires a period of cold stratification. It is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[78]. Stored seed should be kept moist (but not wet) prior to sowing and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as possible[78]. Where possible, sow 1 or 2 seeds only in each deep pot and thin to the best seedling. If you need to transplant the seedlings, then do this as soon as they are large enough to handle, once more using deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Put the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in their first summer, and give them some protection from the cold for at least the first winter[78, K]. Seed can also be sown in situ so long as protection is given from mice etc and the seed is given some protection from cold[200] (a plastic bottle with the top and bottom removed and a wire mesh top fitted to keep the mice out is ideal)",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
