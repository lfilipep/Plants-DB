A useful plant for very poorly-drained soils[185, 200]. The best stands in America are on well-drained soils[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in sandy soils[188] and on chalk[200]. A very hardy tree, tolerating very cold winters with temperatures down to -46°c[200, 238]. In cold weather the leaves turn brown, becoming green again in the spring[226]. It is usually slow growing and short-lived in cultivation in Britain and rarely looks thrifty[81, 185]. However, there are some good specimens in western Britain[4, 14]. Some cultivars are more healthy, 'Lutea' is growing very well in several places and 'Spiralis' is also growing well[185]. Trees live 200 - 300 years in the wild[226].

It can be sown in a cold frame in late winter. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If growing large quantities of plants, the seed can be sown in an outdoor seed bed in mid spring[78]. Grow the plants on for two years and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late autumn or early spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a shaded frame. Forms roots by the end of September but it should be overwintered in a frame[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September in a cold frame. Forms roots in the following summer.
