See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,Fruit - raw or cooked. The dried fruit is said to have a better flavour than most members of this genus[183]. The fruit is about 5 - 7mm in diameter[200].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168].",,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[3, 11, 166, 200], but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. Best given a neutral or slightly acid soil[11]. A difficult plant to cultivate, even in its native California[11]. It is best given a sunny position against a wall[11]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. The cuttings are very slow and can take a year to root[1, 78]. The cuttings of this species usually strike readily[11]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
