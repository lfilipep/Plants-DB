24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good garden soil but preferring a position in full sun[200]. Prefers a rich soil in a cool position in sun or semi-shade with plenty of moisture in the growing season[187]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[187]. A very ornamental plant[1] it is a short-lived perennial[175]. Plants scramble through other plants, supporting themselves by means of tendrils[188, 219]. There has been much confusion in the naming of this plant, two separate names (L. nervosus and L. magellanicus) having been given to what was believed to be different plants. According to one report, L. magellanicus is a distinct species with minor botanical differences and is somewhat hardier than L. nervosus[133]. The two species now seem to have been united under this name[200]. Young plants are extremely attractive to rabbits[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200].",
