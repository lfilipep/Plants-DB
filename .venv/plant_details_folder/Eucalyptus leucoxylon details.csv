0,Eucalyptus leucoxylon,"Yellow Gum, White ironbark, White Eucalyptus",Myrtaceae,10-11,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269].",Open woodland in areas with cool often frosty winters and hot summers[167].,"Australia - South Australia, Victoria.",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusLeucoxylon.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusLeucoxylon2.gif","Bloom Color: Red.

It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Bog Garden;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","An essential oil from the leaves is used as a food flavouring in baked goods, ice cream and sweets[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It does not require a mordant[168].  - pale, tough, strong and durable[167].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a sunny position in a moderately fertile well-drained moisture retentive circum-neutral soil[200]. Prefers heavy clay soils but succeeds in most soils, including limestone[167]. Tolerates poor soils, especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Tolerates dry soils and also drought once it is established[200]. Plants grow well in dry-summer climates[260]. This species is not very hardy in Britain though it experiences frosts in the wild[167]. Another report says that it can tolerate temperatures down to about -8°c[260]. It might be worthwhile trying it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions[200]. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200]. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200]. Plants are shallow-rooting and, especially in windy areas, should be planted out into their permanent positions when small to ensure that they do not suffer from wind-rock[245]. They strongly resent root disturbance and should be container grown before planting out into their permanent position[11]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are a good bee crop[200].  Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - surface sow February/March in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11, 78, 134]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2°c[200]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in June, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
