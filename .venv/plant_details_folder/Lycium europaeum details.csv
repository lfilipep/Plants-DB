13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Lycium europaeum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft 1in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9.  It is in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Fruit - raw or cooked[177]. The fruit is a berry about 8mm in diameter[200]. Only the fully ripe fruits should be eaten[K]. Young shoots - cooked[177].
20,Medicinal Uses,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerThe fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214]."
22,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents."
23,Other Uses Description,Plants have an extensive root system and can be planted to stabilize banks[200].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it does not require a rich soil, flowering and fruiting better in a well-drained soil of moderate quality[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds in impoverished soils[200]. Requires a sunny position[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c and succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. There is much confusion between this species and the closely related L. barbarum and L. chinense. Most, if not all, of the plants being grown as L. europaeum in Britain are in fact L.barbarum[11, 50, 200]. Many botanists unite the three species under the name L. barbarum, though they are distinct[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually good and fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Pinch out the shoot tips of the young plants in order to encourage bushy growth[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel if possible, July/August in individual pots in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, autumn to late winter in a cold frame. High percentage[78, 200]. Division of suckers in late winter. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. Layering."
