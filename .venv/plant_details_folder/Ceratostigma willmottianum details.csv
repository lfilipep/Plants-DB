It is in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,,"Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Industrial Crop: Gum: Used as thickeners and gelling agents. Non-destructively harvested gums come from tapped trees and seed.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Irreg. Intercrop: Irregular intercropping systems are trees scattered throughout cropland.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.",,Bach: Plants used in the Bach flower remedies.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Prefers a light moderately fertile and retentive soil with good drainage, though it tolerates poor dry soils[200] and grows well on chalk[11]. Requires a sunny position[11, 200]. Plants are not fully hardy in Britain, especially if treated as shrubs, but if treated as herbaceous perennials they succeed outdoors in areas where winter temperatures do not fall below about -10 to -15°c[200]. When the woody stems survive the winter it is best to prune them hard in the spring in order to obtain better flowering[11]. Plants flower best on the current years growth[200]. Most, if not all the plants in cultivation in Britain, derive from an original two plants raised from seed in 1908[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Blooms are very showy.","Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of rooted suckers in the spring[200]. Layering in the spring. Plants often self-layer[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood in a closed frame[200]. Plants should be overwintered in a frost-free frame or greenhouse for their first winter[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
