Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiasthmatic  Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Expectorant  Miscellany  NervineIndian Tobacco was a traditional North American Indian remedy for a wide range of conditions[254]. Nowadays it is used mainly as a powerful antispasmodic herb in the treatment of respiratory and muscle disorders[254]. Acting also as a respiratory stimulant, Indian Tobacco is a valuable remedy for conditions such as bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis[254]. The dried flowering herb and the seed are antiasthmatic, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant and nervine[4, 7, 21, 46, 165, 171]. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough and pleurisy[238]. This remedy should be used with great caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[7, 21, 165]. Excess doses cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory failure[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The plant contains the alkaline 'lobeline' which has proved to be of value in helping people to give up smoking tobacco[7, 200, 213]. It is contained in many proprietary anti-smoking mixtures where it mimics the effects of nicotine[238]. The alkaloids present in the leaves are used to stimulate the removal of phlegm from the respiratory tract[213]. When chewed, the leaves induce vomiting, headache and nausea - in larger doses it has caused death[213]. The alkaloids first act as a stimulant and then as a depressive to the autonomic nervous system and in high doses paralyses muscular action in the same way as curare[213]. Externally, the plant is used in treating pleurisy, rheumatism, tennis elbow, whiplash injuries, boils and ulcers[238]. The whole plant is harvested when the lower fruits are ripe and it is used fresh or dried[238].","Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The plant has been burnt in order to smoke out gnats[257].,,"Succeeds in full sun or light shade[200].
