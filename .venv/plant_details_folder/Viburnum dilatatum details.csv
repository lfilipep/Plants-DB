Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Upright or erect.","Viburnum dilatatum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177, 179]. A sweet flavour[178]. The ovoid fruit is about 8mm long and contains a single large seed[200]. Leaves - cooked[105, 177].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Astringent  VulneraryA decoction of the leaves is astringent and vermifuge. It is used for washing and healing maggoty sores[178, 218]. The twigs are also vermifuge whilst the fruits are used as a vermifuge for children[218].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.",A fibre obtained from the inner bark is used for making ropes[178].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Screen, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but is ill-adapted for poor soils and for dry situations[1]. It prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. Plants are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200]. A very ornamental[1] and polymorphic species[58], there are some named varieties developed for the ornamental value of the fruit[182]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
