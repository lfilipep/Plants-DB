Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Astringent  Cardiac  DysenteryThe root is rich in tannin, it is used as an astringent in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery, bleeding etc[222]. It has also been used in the treatment of various heart complaints[257]. The plant probably contains salicylic acid, the chemical forerunner of aspirin[222]. This is anti-inflammatory and analgesic[222].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Specimen. Requires a humus-rich moist soil in semi-shade[200]. Succeeds in full sun only if the soil is reliably moist throughout the growing season[200]. Dislikes dry or acid soils[1, 17]. Does well in marshy soils[24, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Although the plants are perfectly hardy in Britain, they appreciate the winter protection of bracken or some similar mulch when grown in areas of prolonged frosts[200]. Plants spread fairly freely and form large clumps[233]. There is at least one named variety, selected for its ornamental value[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[24, 30]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[1]. The seed can also be sown in a cold frame in spring, germinating best at a temperature of 10 - 13°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have grown enough. If not, keep them in a cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring. Division in autumn or winter[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
