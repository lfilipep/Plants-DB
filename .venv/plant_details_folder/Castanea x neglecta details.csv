13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Castanea x neglecta is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked[183]. Eaten raw, there is a distinct astringency, especially if the fleshy inner skin beneath the outer shell of the seed is not removed[K]. When cooked, however, and especially when baked, the seed becomes much sweeter and has a floury texture[K]. It then makes an excellent food and can be used as a staple food in much the same way as potatoes or cereals[K]. The seed is quite small, though it is larger than C. pumila[11]. Another report says that only one large seed is formed in each seed case[82]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The bark, leaves, wood and seed husks all contain tannin.  - coarse-grained, hard, strong, light, durable, easy to split."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained slightly acid loam but succeeds in dry soils[1, 11, 200]. Once established, it is very drought tolerant[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of highly acid, infertile dry sands[200]. Averse to calcareous soils but succeeds on harder limestones[11, 200]. This species is an excellent soil-enriching understorey in pine forests[200], growing and fruiting well so long as the canopy of pines is fairly light. Although it is very winter-hardy, this species only really thrives in areas with hot summers[200]. This species is a natural hybrid, C. dentata x C. pumila[11, 200]. It is very similar to C. pumila[270], but has larger fruits than C. pumila[11] and often produces two fertile seeds in each fruit[270].. Flowers are produced on wood of the current year's growth[229]. Plants are fairly self-sterile[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Fruits are produced in 2 - 3 years from seed[117]. This species is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed in N. America, there are some named varieties[183]. The plants produce seeds abundantly in the wild[183]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - where possible sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in a seed bed outdoors[78]. The seed must be protected from mice and squirrels. The seed has a short viability and must not be allowed to become dry. It can be stored in a cool place, such as the salad compartment of a fridge, for a few months if it is kept moist, but check regularly for signs of germination. The seed should germinate in late winter or early spring. If sown in an outdoor seedbed, the plants can be left in situ for 1 - 2 years before planting them out in their permanent positions. If grown in pots, the plants can be put out into their permanent positions in the summer or autumn, making sure to give them some protection from the cold in their first winter[K]. This species is a natural hybrid and might not breed true from seed[K]. Division of suckers in winter[200]. They can be planted straight out into their permanent positions."
