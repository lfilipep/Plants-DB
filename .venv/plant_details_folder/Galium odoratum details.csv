19,Edible Uses Description,"TeaLeaves - raw or cooked[62]. The leaves are coumarin-scented (like freshly mown hay), they are used as a flavouring in cooling drinks[2, 9, 27] and are also added to fruit salads etc[183, 200]. The leaves are soaked in white wine to make 'Maitrank', an aromatic tonic drink that is made in Alsace[238]. A fragrant and delicious tea is made from the green-dried leaves and flowers[2, 183, 268]. Slightly wilted leaves are used, the tea has a fresh, grassy flavour[200]. The sweet-scented flowers are eaten or used as a garnish[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Cardiac  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Homeopathy  SedativeSweet woodruff was widely used in herbal medicine during the Middle Ages, gaining a reputation as an external application to wounds and cuts and also taken internally in the treatment of digestive and liver problems[4]. In current day herbalism it is valued mainly for its tonic, diuretic and anti-inflammatory affect[254]. The leaves are antispasmodic, cardiac, diaphoretic, diuretic, sedative[9, 13, 21, 200]. An infusion is used in the treatment of insomnia and nervous tension, varicose veins, biliary obstruction, hepatitis and jaundice[9, 238]. The plant is harvested just before or as it comes into flower and can be dried for later use[9]. One report says that it should be used with caution[21] whilst another says that it is entirely safe[9]. Excessive doses can produce dizziness and symptoms of poisoning[268]. The dried plant contains coumarins and these act to prevent the clotting of blood - though in excessive doses it can cause internal bleeding[254]. The plant is grown commercially as a source of coumarin, used to make an anticoagulant drug[268]. Do not use this remedy if you are taking conventional medicine for circulatory problems or if you are pregnant[254]. Both Asperuloside (a terpenoid) and Coumarin (a benzopyrone) occur in some species of Galium. Asperuloside can be converted into prostaglandins (hormone-like compounds that stimulate the uterus and affect blood vessels), making the genus of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry[238]. A homeopathic remedy made from the plant is used in the treatment of inflammation of the uterus[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Pot-pourri: Aromatic plants used to impart a pleasant smell to an area. Can this be grouped with incense or essential oil?,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A red dye is obtained from the root[168]. Soft-tan and grey-green dyes are obtained from the stems and leaves[168]. A good ground-cover plant for growing on woodland edges or in the cool shade of shrubs[24, 200]. It spreads rapidly at the roots[28, 197, 208]. It is an ideal carpeting plant for bulbs to grow through[K]. Although the fresh plant has very little aroma, as it dries it becomes very aromatic with the scent of newly-mown grass and then retains this aroma for years[2, 200]. It is used in the linen cupboard to protect from moths etc.[4, 14] It was also formerly used as a strewing herb and is an ingredient of pot-pourri[238]. It was also hung up in bunches in the home in order to keep the rooms cool and fragrant during the summertime[245].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a loose moist leafy soil in some shade[200]. Tolerates dry soils but the leaves quickly become scorched when growing in full sun[200]. This species does not thrive in a hot climate[200]. Prefers a moist calcareous soil[9, 13, 14]. Dislikes very acid soils[187]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 8.3. This species is very tolerant of atmospheric pollution and grows well in towns[208]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[187]. Sweet woodruff is occasionally cultivated in the herb garden for its medicinal and other uses. The dried foliage has the sweet scent of newly mown hay[245]. A very ornamental plant[1] but it spreads rapidly[28] and can be invasive[200]. However, this is rarely to the detriment of other plants since these are normally able to grow through it[200]. It does no harm to any plants more than 60cm tall[208]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for dried flowers, Fragrant flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in situ as soon as it is ripe in late summer[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring though it may be very slow to germinate[200]. A period of cold stratification helps reduce the germination time. Lots of leafmold in the soil and the shade of trees also improves germination rates. Division in spring. The plant can also be successfully divided throughout the growing season if the divisions are kept moist until they are established[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Cuttings of soft wood, after flowering, in a frame.",
