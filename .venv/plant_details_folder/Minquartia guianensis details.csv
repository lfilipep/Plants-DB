13,Summary,"Minquartia guianensis is a flowering, evergreen tree that can be found in South America and is growing up to 33 m tall and up to 120 cm in trunk diameter. The trunk is cylindrical and straight and the crown is short and oval. The flowers are in spikes located at the leaf axils. The fruit is narrowly oval, green when young and turns yellow to red when ripe. It is edible. The bark is used medicinally against malaria, colds, and intestinal parasites. It exudes white latex when damaged. The wood is used in poles and posts."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Minquartia guianensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: In agroforestry trials in Peru, the best establishment and growth of this tree was observed where seedlings were mixed with plantains, or on the borders of the field where neighbouring taller vegetation provided partial shade. A comparison between individuals in agroforestry trials and those in natural forests found that larger DBHs were obtained in agroforestry at a given height and that diameter growth was also higher in agroforestry trees, showing that this species can establish and thrive under these conditions. Plants grown in these agroforestry trials flowered and fruited from the age of approximately 6 years, and the fertile periods in both the flood plain and terra firma trials coincided more or less with the pattern observed in natural flood plain forests. On the basis of the results from this it was concluded that without silvicultural measures to enhance the density and growth of Minqurtia guianensis, there is only a limited ability of natural flood plain forests to supply the wood of this species[381 ]. Other Uses The fissured bark exudes a white latex when cut[420 ]. The wood is fine-textured, irregular-grained, very heavy and almost impervious to rot. A valuable timber, it is very hard to cut but is much used for external purposes such as poles, posts etc[420 ]. The wood is exceptionally durable and has been reported to have lasted 30 - 40 years in the ground without any signs of decay[381 ]. It is resistant to attacks from fungus and termites. Because of this exceptional durability, it has been extracted for subsistence and commercial purposes, mainly for posts and poles in construction[381 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,Prefers a position in some shade[420 ].
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A low germination rate can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 30 - 40 days[420 ]. When the seedbed sown seedlings are 4 - 5cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 8 - 9 months later[420 ]."
