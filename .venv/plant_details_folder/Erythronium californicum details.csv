It is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"The following use has been noted for the closely related E. origonum and probably also applies to this species[K], which has a corm 35 - 50mm long[71]:- Bulb - raw, cooked or dried for later use[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Prefers slightly acid soil conditions but succeeds in chalky soils if these contain plenty of humus[164]. Requires semi-shade, preferably provided by trees or shrubs, and a well-drained soil[42, 164]. Succeeds in almost any light soil, preferring one that is rich in humus[1]. This species is hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Plants are growing and spreading well in the light shade of a woodland garden at Kew[K]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value, though some of these are also more valuable as food plants since they spread well in Britain[258]. Bulbs should be planted about 7cm deep[1]. Closely related to E. helenae, E. origonum, E. citrinum and E. howellii[207].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a cold frame. Water lightly in summer, it should germinate in autumn or winter[164, 200]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification[164]. Sow as early in spring as possible in a cold frame. Sow the seed thinly so that it will not be necessary to prick them out for their first year of growth. Give an occasional liquid feed to the seedlings to make sure that they do not become nutrient deficient. When the plants are dormant, pot up the small bulbs putting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on in a shady position in the greenhouse for another 2 3 years and then plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant in late summer. Division of the bulbs in the summer as the leaves die down[1]. Larger bulbs can be replanted immediately into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up smaller bulbs and grow them on in a shady position in a greenhouse for a year before planting them out when dormant in late summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
