19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 5, 33, 37, 100, 183]. A very nice sweet flavour[27], reminiscent of walnuts[2]. They are best mixed with other root vegetables and used in winter salads[2, 9]. Leaves - raw or cooked as a potherb[2, 5, 9, 27, 33, 37, 100, 183]. A fairly bland flavour, with a hint of sweetness, they are quite acceptable raw in salads[K]. The leaves are rich in vitamin C, they make an acceptable winter salad[4]. Young shoots in spring can be blanched and cooked like asparagus[183].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily cultivated plant, it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 4, 200], though it succeeds in most good soils[4]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.8 to 7.5. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Plants often self-sow in the garden[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Rampion was formerly often cultivated for its edible root, though it has fallen into virtual disuse[4]. When grown for its edible root, the plant should not be allowed to flower[4]. Plants can be grown in a meadow[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - surface sow May/June in situ. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138].,
