Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",L. platycarpum. (Torr.)Coult.&Rose.,Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Root - raw or cooked[257]. About the size of peanuts, the roots were a staple food of the local native North American Indian tribes[2]. When roasted it makes an excellent vegetable[2]. It can also be dried and ground into a powder, when it develops a mild sweet flavour[2, 105, 161, 177]. The dried flowers and upper leaves are used as a flavouring in soups and stews[257].","Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It can be assumed that plants will require a dry to moist but well-drained soil in a sunny position. This is a taxonomically very difficult genus, many of the species now included in it have at times been included in other genera[60].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[188]. Stored seed can be rather slow to germinate, when sown in the spring it usually takes at least 12 months to germinate. Giving it a period of cold stratification might reduce this time. The seedlings need to be pricked out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and should be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer. Fresh seed can be sown immediately in situ[188]. Division may be possible in spring or autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
