It is related to borage, Borago officinalis, and has many similar actions, especially in its sweat-inducing and diuretic effects[254]. In recent times, however, it has fallen out of use, partly due to lack of interest in its medicinal potential and partly to its content of pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are toxic in isolation[254]. The leaves and flowering stems are antitussive, aphrodisiac, demulcent, diaphoretic, diuretic, pectoral and vulnerary[4, 7, 222]. An infusion of the plant is taken internally as a diuretic and in the treatment of fevers, headaches, chest conditions etc[244, 254]. The juice of the plant is an effective emollient for reddened and delicate skins, it is used as a poultice or plaster to treat boils and carbuncles[7, 254]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[7]. The roots contain the healing agent allantoin[222]. The plant is said to be efficacious in the treatment of snake bites[4].
