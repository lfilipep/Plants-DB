See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,East Wall. By. South Wall.

Another report says that it is best grown in a good, very gritty soil in sun or semi-shade in a bulb frame[90]. This is a rather difficult plant to cultivate in Britain, it is very cold hardy but is intolerant of wetness especially in the winter[1]. Another report says that the plant requires plenty of moisture when in growth, but very dry conditions after it has flowered[245]. It is easiest to grow in a bulb frame but this species is one of the least difficult of the genus[90] and is worth trying outdoors at the base of a south-facing wall, especially with shrubs that like these conditions[120]. Bulbs can be lifted as soon as the foliage dies down in the summer and stored overwinter in a cool dry place, replanting in spring[138]. Another report says that they should be replanted immediately[1]. Bulbs frequently divide after flowering, the bulblets taking 2 years to reach flowering size[200]. Hand pollination is necessary if seed is required[1]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This species is closely related to C. amabilis[200].","Seed - sow as soon as ripe or early spring in a cold frame in a very sharply draining medium. Stratification may be helpful. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Leave the seedlings undisturbed for their first two years growth[138], but give them an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. It is quite difficult to get the seedlings through their first period of dormancy since it is all too easy either to dry them out completely or keep them too moist when they will rot[214]. After their second year of growth, pot up the dormant bulbs in late summer and grow them on for at least another 2 years in the greenhouse before trying them outside. Seedlings take about 5 - 7 years to come into flower[214]. Division of the bulbs as soon as the foliage dies down. One report says that the bulbs must be planted into their permanent positions immediately[1], whilst another says that they can be stored overwinter and replanted in the spring[138]. Stem bulbils, harvested from the stems after flowering[200]. They can be stored cool and dry then planted in pots in the cold frame in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
