See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Holcus halapensis.,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - raw or cooked. It can be used whole in a similar manner to rice or millet, or it can be ground into a flour and used as a cereal in making bread, cakes etc[46, 105].","Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Demulcent  DiureticThe seed is demulcent and diuretic[240].,Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,The plant is a potential source of biomass with yields of up to 19 tonnes per hectare[269].,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types, including upland clay, but seems to do best on porous fertile lowlands and river bottoms[269]. It does well on heavy clay soils of relatively high fertility and water holding capacity[269]. Temperatures below 13°C tend to inhibit flowering[269]. For best results, it requires a warm sunny position[1]. The plant is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 9 to 429cm, an annual temperature in the range of 8.3 to 27.8°C and a pH of 4.9 to 8.2[269]. This species is not very winter hardy, tolerating occasional temperatures down to about -5°c so long as the soil is not too wet. It is best adapted to warm humid summer-rainfall areas in the subtropics, not growing well in strictly tropical areas[269]. A very aggressive plant[46], spreading freely at the roots and only suitable for large areas[233]. It is a parent of the cultivated Sorghum (S. bicolor)[171]. Classified as a short day plant, it does not flower if the daylight hours exceed about 13 hours per day[269].","Seed - sow April in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division in mid spring as the plant comes into new growth. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
