See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Hedge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It does not like being trimmed[75].",,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant of saline conditions[11]. This species is not found in saline soils in the wild and so might not be tolerant of them in cultivation[K]. Grows well in heavy clay soils as well as in sands and even shingle[182]. Usually found near the coast, it succeeds inland if given a fairly good deep loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerant of maritime winds and dry soils when grown near the coast[11], plants require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in non-saline soils because they use the soil salts that are found in saline soils to help them reduce transpiration[200]. Plants flower mainly on wood produced in the previous summer[227]. Growth can be restricted by cutting back the plants after they have flowered in the spring, hedges are also best trimmed at this time[188]. Closely related to T. tetrandra. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15 - 25cm long, planted outdoors in late autumn in a nursery bed or straight into their permanent position.
