17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Diuretic  Homeopathy  Purgative  VermifugeHedge hyssop was once widely used as a medicinal herb but it is now considered to be obsolete because of its toxicity[238]. The root and the flowering herb are cardiac, diuretic, violently purgative and vermifuge[4, 9, 21]. The plant has been used in the treatment of liver problems, enlargement of the spleen, dropsy, jaundice, intestinal worms etc[4, 238]. The plant is harvested whilst in flower in the summer and dried for later use[9, 238]. Use with caution, in excess the plant causes abortion, kidney damage and bowel haemorrhage[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. A homeopathic remedy is made from the flowering plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of cystitis, colic and certain stomach disorders[9]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich moist alkaline soil in full sun[1, 200, 238]. Succeeds in pond margins[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
