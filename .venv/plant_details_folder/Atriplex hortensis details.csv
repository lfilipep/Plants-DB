0,Atriplex hortensis,"Orach, Garden orache",Chenopodiaceae,5-9,"No member of this genus contains any toxins, all have more or less edible leaves. However, if grown with artificial fertilizers, they may concentrate harmful amounts of nitrates in their leaves. The seed contains saponins[240]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching the seed or flour in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Arable land, waste and disturbed ground, shingle etc[9].",Europe. An occasional garden escape in Britain[17].,(4 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AtriplexHortensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AtriplexHortensis3.jpg",,"Atriplex hortensis is a ANNUAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 16, 27, 33]. Used like spinach[9], they have a bland flavour and are traditionally mixed with sorrel leaves in order to modify the acidity of the latter[183]. Another report says that the flavour is stronger than spinach[264]. Seed - cooked. It can be ground into a meal and used in soups etc or be mixed with flour when making bread[177, 183]. The seed is said to be a good source of vitamin A[240]. The seed is also said to contain some saponins[240]. See the notes above on toxicity. The seed is small and fiddly to harvest and use.","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Diuretic  Emetic  PurgativeThe leaves are diuretic, emetic and purgative[100, 269]. They are also said to be a stimulant to the metabolism and an infusion is used as a spring tonic and a remedy for tiredness and nervous exhaustion[9]. They have been suggested as a folk remedy for treating plethora and lung ailments[269]. The leaves are said to be efficacious when used externally in the treatment of gout[4]. The seeds, mixed with wine, are said to cure yellow jaundice. They also excite vomiting[269]. The fruits are purgative and emetic[269]. Liniments and emollients prepared from the whole plant, like the juice of the plant, are said to be folk remedies for indurations and tumours, especially of the throat[269].","Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.","A blue dye is obtained from the seed[74, 100]. The plant is a potential source of biomass. Yields of 14 tonnes per hectare have been achieved in the vicinity of Landskrona and Lund, Sweden. Higher yields might be expected farther south. If the leaf-protein were extracted, this should leave more than 13 tonnes biomass as by-product, for potential conversion to liquid or gaseous fuels[269].",,"Orach is a very easily grown plant, doing equally well in a wide variety of well-drained soils, though rich, moisture-retentive soils give the quick growth that is necessary for the production of tender leaves[33, 37, 200, 269]. Plants require a position in full sun and are tolerant of saline and very alkaline soils[200]. They thrive in any temperate climate, and are drought resistant[269]. Orach is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 30 to 140cm, an average annual temperature in the range of 6 to 24°C, and a pH of 5.0 to 8.2[269]. Orach was formerly cultivated for its edible leaves, there are some named varieties[183]. It can be grown as a warm weather substitute for spinach[183]. Some forms of this species have bronze or deep red leaves and are occasionally grown as ornamental plants, their leaves taste the same as the green-leafed forms[K]. Plants are fast-growing[238] and usually self-sow quite freely if the surrounding soil is disturbed by hoeing etc[K]. They tolerate hot weather well, but soon go to seed so successive sowings at 4 weekly intervals are required during the growing season if a continuous supply of leaves is required[269]. Leaves can be harvested 40 - 60 days after sowing the seed[269]. This species is a poor companion plant for potatoes, inhibiting their growth when growing close to them[20].","Seed - sow March to August in situ, only just covering the seed[134]. Germination is usually good and rapid[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
