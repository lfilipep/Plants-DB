22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country, especially if plants are obtained from the colder provenances of its range. See the plants native habitat for ideas on its cultivation needs."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a warm greenhouse in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings. We have no information but suggest trying cuttings of almost ripe wood, August in a frame."
