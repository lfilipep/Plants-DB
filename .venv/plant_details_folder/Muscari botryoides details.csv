24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant[200], it prefers a rich open well-drained soil[1] but succeeds in any soil and situation[1, 42, 90]. The dormant bulbs are very hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -10°c[214]. Does very well in short grass[1], increasing freely and it can become invasive[200]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[200]. The flowers have a scent that resembles the honey-musk scent of buddleia[245]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a greenhouse[200]. The seed can also be sown in early spring in a greenhouse. A good proportion of the seed usually germinates within 2 - 3 months. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be left undisturbed in the pot for their first year of growth. Give them an occasional liquid feed in the growing season to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. When the plants become dormant in late summer, pot up the small bulbs placing 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another one or two years in the greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant in late summer. Division of offsets in July/August after the leaves die down[1]. It can be done every other year if a quick increase is required[1]. Larger bulbs can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out when they are dormant in late summer."
