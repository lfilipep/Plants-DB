4,Known Hazards,"The seed is rich in saponins[20, 65]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching the seed or flour in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Aesculus indica is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 12 m (39ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a gruel[2, 63, 145, 146, 158]. The seed is roasted then eaten in Nepal[272]. It is also dried then ground into a flour and used with wheat flour to develop the flavour when making bread[272]. The seed is quite large, about 35mm in diameter[194], and is easily harvested. Unfortunately it also contains toxic saponins and these need to be removed before it can be eaten. The seed is used as an emergency food in times of famine when all else fails[177]. It is dried and ground into a powder, this is then soaked in water for about 12 hours before use in order to remove the bitter saponins and can be used to make a 'halva'[194]. It is estimated that mature trees yield about 60kg of seeds per annum in the wild[194]. See also the notes above on toxicity."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Acrid: Causes heat and irritation when applied to the skin.,Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Acrid  Anthelmintic  Antirheumatic  Astringent  Narcotic  StomachicThe seed is astringent, acrid and narcotic[272]. An oil from the seed is applied externally in the treatment of skin disease and rheumatism[240, 243, 272]. The juice of the bark is also used to treat rheumatism[272]. A paste made from the oil cake is applied to the forehead to relieve headaches[272]. The seed is given to horses suffering from colic[240, 243]. It is also used as an anthelmintic on horses to rid them of intestinal parasites[272]."
22,Other Uses,"Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Saponins in the seed are used as a soap substitute[169]. The saponins can be easily obtained by chopping the seed into small pieces and infusing them in hot water. This water can then be used for washing the body, clothes etc. Its main drawback is a lingering odour of horse chestnuts[K].  - soft, close grained. Used for construction, cases, spoons, cups etc[145, 146, 158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy well-drained soil but is not too fussy[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds on chalk[11]. Dislikes dry soils[11]. This species does very well in south-west England, growing best in areas where the minimum temperatures do not fall below about -5°c[200]. Young shoots in the spring can be cut back by late frosts in low-lying districts[11, 126]. Trees cast quite a dense shade[194]. Most members of this genus transplant easily, even when fairly large[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown outdoors or in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[11, 80]. The seed germinates almost immediately and must be given protection from severe weather[130]. The seed has a very limited viability and must not be allowed to dry out. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours prior to sowing and even after this may still not be viable[80, 113]. It is best to sow the seed with its 'scar' downwards[130]. If sowing the seed in a cold frame, pot up the seedlings in early spring and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer."
