24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country and could be resistant to maritime exposure. It is quite probable that this species is better included in the genus Angelica, as A. lucida[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame or in situ as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be stored and then sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. If sown in a seedbed or in pots, the plants should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[1]."
