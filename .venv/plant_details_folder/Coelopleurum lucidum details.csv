It is quite probable that this species is better included in the genus Angelica, as A. lucida[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[200].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame or in situ as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be stored and then sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. If sown in a seedbed or in pots, the plants should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
