0,Tilia mongolica,Mongolian Lime,Tiliaceae,3-6,None known,"Mountain slopes, 1300 - 2300 metres in China[109].",E. Asia - N. China to Mongolia.,(3 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/TiliaMongolica.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/TiliaMongolica2.jpg","Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Columnar, Pyramidal.","Tilia mongolica is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Young leaves and shoots - raw or cooked[105]. An emergency food, it is only used when all else fails[177]. A refreshing herb tea is made from the flowers. A very good chocolate substitute is made from a paste of the ground fruits and flowers[2]. Trials on marketing the product failed because the paste decomposes readily[2].","Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  SedativeA tea made from the flowers is antispasmodic, diaphoretic and sedative[226].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.","A fibre is obtained from the tough inner bark It can be made into diverse items such as mats, shoes and coarse cloth[229].",,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Screen, Specimen. Prefers a good moist loamy alkaline to neutral soil but succeeds on slightly acid soils[11, 200]. Grows poorly on any very dry or very wet soil[200]. Dislikes exposed positions according to one report[200], whilst another says that it is tolerant of exposure[125]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[188]. Prefers a continental climate, growing more slowly and not producing fertile seed in areas with cool summers[200]. This species flourishes in Britain[11, 125]. Lime trees tend to hybridise freely if other members of the genus are growing nearby[238]. If growing plants from seed it is important to ensure the seed came from a wild source or from an isolated clump of the single species[K]. Grows best in a woodland situation, young plants tolerate a reasonable level of side shade[200]. Unlike most other members of this genus, this species does not usually become infested with aphis[125]. Quite tolerant of root disturbance, semi-mature trees up to 5 metres tall have been transplanted successfully. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - much of the seed produced in Britain is not viable, cut a few seedcases open to see if there is a seed inside[80]. If possible, obtain fresh seed that is ripe but has not as yet developed a hard seed coat and sow it immediately in a cold frame. It may germinate in the following spring though it could take 18 months[80]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate. It has a hard seed coat, embryo dormancy and a hard coat on the pericarp. All these factors mean that the seed may take up to 8 years to germinate[80]. One way of shortening this time is to stratify the seed for 5 months at high temperatures (10°c at night, up to 30°c by day) and then 5 months cold stratification[80]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in spring just before the leaves unfurl. Takes 1 - 3 years[78]. Suckers, when formed, can be removed with as much root as possible during the dormant season and replanted immediately[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
