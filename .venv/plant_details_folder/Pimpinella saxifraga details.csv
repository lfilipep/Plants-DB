24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any good soil[1], preferring rather moist conditions[187]. Grows best in a cool position[233]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. If you can obtain fresh seed then it is best sown immediately. This can be done in situ if you have sufficient seed, but if you only have a small quantity then it is safer to sow it in pots in a cold frame. Sow stored seed as soon as you can obtain it, this is probably best done in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the pot-grown seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer."
