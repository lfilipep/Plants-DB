24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in any well-drained fertile soil[1, 200]. Plants are drought tolerant[260]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. It succeeds outdoors as a perennial only in essentially frost-free climates[200]. It can, however, be grown as an annual in this country, flowering and setting seed in its first year[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. If the seed does not germinate within 4 weeks then chill it for 3 weeks at 2°c and return it to the greenhouse[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
