This species tends to be a short-lived perennial[17]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer."
