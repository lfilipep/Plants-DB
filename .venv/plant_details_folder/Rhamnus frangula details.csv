0,Rhamnus frangula,Alder Buckthorn,Rhamnaceae,3-7,"The plant is poisonous unless stored for 12 months before use[4, 19, 76]. This report is probably referring to the bark. Do not use in cases of intestinal obstruction, stenosis, atony, inflammatory colon disease, appendicitis, abdominal pain of unknown origin. Avoid long-term use. Two weeks recommended under medical supervision [301].","Swamps and damp places, usually on moist heaths and damp open woods, preferring a peaty soil[9, 17, 21].","Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Frangula alnus. Mill.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Aperient  Cathartic  Cholagogue  Laxative  Purgative  Tonic  VermifugeAlder buckthorn has been used medicinally as a gentle laxative since at least the Middle Ages[244]. The bark contains 3 - 7% anthraquinones, these act on the wall of the colon stimulating a bowel movement approximately 8 - 12 hours after ingestion[254]. It is so gentle and effective a treatment when prescribed in the correct dosages that it is completely safe to use for children and pregnant women[244]. The bark also contains anthrones and anthranols, these induce vomiting but the severity of their effect is greatly reduced after the bark has been dried and stored for a long time[254]. The bark is harvested in early summer from the young trunk and moderately sized branches, it must then be dried and stored for at least 12 months before being used[4, 238] The inner bark is cathartic, cholagogue, laxative (the fresh bark is violently purgative), tonic, vermifuge[4, 9, 13, 21, 165]. It is taken internally as a laxative for chronic atonic constipation and is also used to treat abdominal bloating, hepatitis, cirrhosis, jaundice, and liver and gall bladder complaints[238]. It should be used with caution since excess doses or using the bark before it is cured can cause violent purging[9, 21]. Externally, the bark is used to treat gum diseases and scalp infestations[238], or as a lotion for minor skin irritations[244]. The fruit is occasionally used, it is aperient without being irritating[4]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Rhamnus frangula for constipation (see [302] for critics of commission E).","Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Nails: A few woods are tough enough to be used in place of metal nails in certain circumstances.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A yellow dye is obtained from the leaves and bark[4, 115]. It is much used in Russia and turns black when mixed with salts of iron[4]. A green dye is obtained from the unripe fruit[4, 115]. A blue or grey dye is obtained from the ripe berries[4, 115]. Plants can be grown as an informal (untrimmed) hedge, though they are also amenable to trimming[200]. The cultivar 'Tallhedge (syn 'Columnaris') is very suitable for this purpose[200]. The wood is used to make wooden nails, shoe lasts, veneer etc[46, 61]. It is the source of a high quality charcoal that is used by artists[4, 11, 13, 17, 100, 115, 182, 186].",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any reasonably good soil[11, 98], preferring neutral to acid conditions[238]. It grows well on damp or peaty soils[98]. Prefers a moist moderately fertile soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Grows well in wet soils but not if they are water-logged[186]. Dislikes drought or exposure to strong winds[186]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238]. Alder buckthorn is a slow-growing plant, though it coppices well. It was at one time often grown for its wood which was used in making charcoal[186]. The plants regenerate well after forest fires or grazing[186]. Plants flower on one-year old wood and also on the current year's growth[4]. Cultivated as a medicinal plant in S. Europe[57]. Often bears the aecidospore stage of 'crown rust' of oats[1]. The species in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. A good bee plant[4] and a main food plant for the larvae of the yellow brimstone butterfly[186]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed will require 1 - 2 months cold stratification at about 5° and should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame or outdoor seedbed[200]. Germination is usually good, at least 80% by late spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame.
