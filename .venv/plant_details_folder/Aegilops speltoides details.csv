25,Cultivation Details Description,"No records of cultivation details have been seen, the plant grows well at Kew on an acid gravelly soil and also in Cornwall on a slightly acid loam[K]. It is probably best grown in a sunny position but tolerates light shade[K]. This species is believed to have hybridized with primitive forms of Triticum spp (Wheat) to produce some of the more modern Triticum spp. It could therefore be of value in breeding programmes."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in situ and only just cover the seed. Make sure the soil does not dry out before the plants germinate. Seed can also be sown early March in a greenhouse and planted out in May.
