4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Rich soils along the banks of streams, floodplains, pastures, roadsides and edges of woodlands, often forming thickets[229]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prunus munsoniana is a deciduous Tree growing to 8 m (26ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 46, 82]. Thin skinned with a juicy aromatic flesh that is often of good dessert quality[183]. It can be eaten out of hand, used in pies, preserves etc or be dried for later use[183]. We do not know how large the fruit is but it contains a seed the shell of which is 15mm x 20mm[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].  - hard, heavy. Of little commercial value because of its small size[229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. Closely related to Prunus rivularis, and possibly no more than a form of that species[274]. A fast-growing but short-lived species, it can reach flowering and fruiting age within 3 years from seed[229]. It is cultivated for its edible fruit in N. America, where there are some named varieties[1, 46, 61]. It has also been hybridized with other species to produce new fruiting cultivars[82]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. This species suckers freely in the wild, forming quite large thickets[82]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200]. Layering in spring."
