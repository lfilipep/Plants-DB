It is used as a substitute for Tung oil for the production of paints, linoleum, ink etc[317 ]. The seeds contain about 61% oil[317 ].

Of poor quality, it is used for carpentry, making wagon wheels, posts, planks etc[317 , 625 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: Standard  Regional CropGrows best in a sunny position[625 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[625 ]. Newly planted young trees usually establish and grow away moderately well[625 ]. Grows naturally in sub-humid tropical climates, generally in areas with annual lows of 20 to 25 °C, annual highs of 30 to 35 °C, annual rainfall of 600 to 1400 mm and a dry season of 4 to 8 months. Performs best on free-draining loam and sand soils of a moderately acid to slightly alkaline nature, generally with a pH of 5.0 to 7.5 on on sites with full to partial sun exposure. It has good tolerance to drought and seasonal flooding."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, it can be sown complete with the surrounding fruit if necessary. Sow in a nursery seedbed in a sunny position. Germination rates are usually above 50% with the seed sprouting within 45 - 55 days[625 ]. Cuttings."
