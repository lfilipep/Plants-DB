13,Summary,"Senegalia senegal or Gum Arabic is a small, spiny, deciduous tree native to semidesert regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Oman, Pakistan, and west coastal India. It is also known in other common names such as Gum acacia, Gum arabic tree, Senegal gum, and Sudan gum arabic. It grows about 5-12 m tall and 30 cm in trunk diameter, with a rounded canopy, short trunk, and low branches. Being a legume, it has the capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve soil conditions. This species is of high valued for its production of gum arabic which is used as an additive to food, in cosmetics, and in crafts. Dried seeds can be consumed as food. Medicinally, gum arabic is used to treat sore throats, coughs, catarrh, dysentery, diarrhea, burns, leprosy, ophthalmia, hemorrhage, gonorrhea, and nodular leprosy. The seed yields oil, which is used in soap-making, and dyes. The wood is used for posts, poles, tool handles, etc. It also makes a good fuel and charcoal. Tree bark and roots are used in making ropes.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Senegalia senegal is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

19,Edible Uses Description,"rThe gum obtained from the trunk is important in the food industry, where it is used as an emulsifier, stabilizer and flavour fixative[238 ]. It is also used as an additive (E414) that retards the crystallization of sugar[238 ]. It is found especially in products such as chewing gum and confectionery[238 ]. The gum is harvested after the rainy season by scraping it off the trunk and branches from which it oozes[238 ]. Unhealthy trees tend to give higher yields and incisions are sometimes made into the bark in order to increase yields[238 ]. Seed[396 ]. The dried seed is cooked as a protein source[325 ]. The dried seed is the main component of panchkut, a delicacy in Jodhpur, India, also containing fruits of Capparis decidua, Cucumis sativa and Prosopis cinerearia[303 ].",

23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes used in soil improvement and dune stabilization schemes[396 ]. It is used as a pioneer species to re-establish woodland in dry areas[325 ]. Intercrops well with plants such as sorghum and millet[396 ]. It is highly suitable for use in agroforestry systems in combination with watermelon, millet, forage grasses etc[325 ]. In Sudan it is grown in 'gum gardens' for gum production as well as to restore soil fertility[325 ]. Other Uses: The gum obtained from the trunk has a variety of uses, including adding lustre to crape and silk, thickening colours, calico printing, manufacturing ink and as a mucilage[46 ]. Careful 'wounding' of the trunk is required for sustainable gum production[396 ]. The cut should be only just deep enough for the gum to exude[396 ]. Cordage is made from the roots, either directly or after beating to extract the fibres; its strength makes it suitable for well ropes and fishing nets[299 , 303 ]. An oil obtained from the seed is used for making soap[299 , 303 ]. A dye is obtained from the seeds[396 ]. The heartwood is almost black and takes polish well[303 ]. The wood is used for posts, poles, tool handles, sugar cane crushers etc[303 , 396 ]. The dense wood is an excellent fuel and is also made into charcoal[396 ]. The calorific value is estimated at 3,000 kcal/kg[303 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Gum: Used as thickeners and gelling agents. Non-destructively harvested gums come from tapped trees and seed.,Industrial Crop: Tannin: Occur generally in the roots, wood, bark, leaves, and fruit of many plants. Used in tanning leather, dyeing fabric, making ink, and medical applications.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Pod  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Gum  Industrial Crop: Tannin  Management: Coppice  Regional CropA plant for the drier tropical areas, where it can be found at elevations from 100 - 1,700 metres[325 ]. Tolerates a minimum temperature of about 15°c[238 ]. Plants can tolerate high daily temperatures, but are sensitive to frost[325 , 396 ]. Prefers areas where the mean annual rainfall is 300 - 400mm, but can survive with as little as 100mm and a dry period of 8 - 11 months[325 ]. Grows best in a moist, well-drained, neutral to acid soil[238 , 396 ]. Gum production is best when the plant grows in a poor soil[396 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 8[774 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[325 , 396 ]. Plants can be coppiced and pollarded[396 ]. Wood yields of 120 - 190 cubic metres per hectare, with annual increments of 0.5 - 1.0 cubic metres per hectare have been recorded[303 ]. The gum exudes from ducts in the inner bark; it is tapped in the hot season when the trees are stressed. Tapping begins when trees are 4 - 5 years old, commencing after leaf fall and ceasing during the colder months of the dry season. Gum nodules form in 3 - 8 weeks, exuding from the former broken abscission scars[303 ]. Care should be taken to keep the gum clean[303 ]. Annual yields stand at 188 - 2,856g for young trees and 379 - 6,754g for older trees (7-15 years). Gum production is excellent on poor soils and higher in stressed trees[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - unlike other acacias, the seed coat is not impermeable to water even after storage, and scarification is normally not necessary[325 ]. Germination is improved, however, if the seed is pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing[238 , 325 ]. The seed can be sown in individual pots, preferably deep pots to allow the taproot to develop[325 ]. It usually germinates quickly and freely, sprouting best at a temperature around 21°c[238 ]. Plants make a deep taproot and resent root disturbance, they should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[238 ]. Semi-ripe cuttings of lateral shoots[238 ].",
