Succeeds in most fertile soils, preferably of a woodland nature[1, 11]. In Britain it grows better in full sun than in shade[11]. Tolerates limy soils[200]. Tolerates urban pollution, maritime conditions and windswept locations[200], though not full maritime exposure[K]. This species is hardy to -15°c[184], it can be cut to the ground in severe winters but usually resprouts from the base[200]. The flowers, which are delicately scented, are borne at the end of the current season's growth[245]. Birds, especially pheasants, are very fond of the fruit[11, 182]. Plants frequently self-sow when growing in suitable conditions[182]. Plants do not normally need pruning though weak shoots can be cut back to ground level in the spring in order to encourage more vigorous growth[188]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in late autumn[78]. Very easy when done this way[11], it germinates in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer or following spring. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and can take more than a year to germinate. Sow it as soon as possible in a cold frame. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 20 - 25cm with a heel, planted in open ground in October/November. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of greenwood in spring in a frame[1]. Division in autumn[200]. Very simple, plant the divisions out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
