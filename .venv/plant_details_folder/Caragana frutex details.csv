See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",Agroforestry Uses: The plant is useful for stabilizing soil on slopes[74]. Fixes nitrogen [1-2]. Other uses: Grown as an ornamental in gardens[74].,,"Caragana frutex prefers a continental climate with its hot summers, cold winters and usually a clear movement from one season to another. The dormant plant can tolerate temperatures down to at least -30°c, but in more maritime climates it is often tempted to come into growth early and this new growth can easily be damaged by late spring frosts[200]. Prefers full sun and a light sandy dry or well-drained soil[1, 11, 200]. Does not require a rich soil, succeeding on marginal land[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].  Profusely-branched, deciduous shrub; it can grow 50 - 150cm tall, occasionally to 300cm[11, 74]. The plant produces long, often erect, supple branches, that are not much divided except near the ends[11]. The plant produces suckers and can spread to form a thicket of growth[200].  The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1) .   For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200 ]. It usually germinates in 2 weeks[K ]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water then sown in a cold frame[78 , 113 , 200 ]. If the seed has not swollen then scarify it and re-soak for another 12 hours before sowing[138 ]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c[138 ]. Good percentage[11 ]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, mid summer in a frame[113 ].
