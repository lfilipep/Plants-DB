24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will succeed outdoors in Britain, though judging by its native range it is likely to be hardy at least in the milder areas of the country. There is some confusion over this name, according to [74] this species is endemic to Siberia whilst other reports say that its range is China and Japan[105, 176, 177]. According to [176], the correct name for this species is Siler divaricatum. [L.} and it is possible that two distinct species are being treated here.",
