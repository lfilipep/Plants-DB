2,Family,Fabaceae or Leguminosae
3,USDA hardiness,5-9
4,Known Hazards,"The seed contains a toxic amino-acid which, in large quantities, can cause a very serious disease of the nervous system known as 'lathyrism'. The seed is said to be perfectly safe and very nutritious in small quantities, but should not comprise more than 30% of the diet[65, 76]."
5,Habitats,"Woods, hedges and thickets in hilly country avoiding chalk[17]."

14,Physical Characteristics,"Lathyrus linifolius montanus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[2, 177]. Used as a vegetable, they are served in the same manner as sweet chestnuts[2]. Some caution is advised in the use of this seed, see the notes above on toxicity. Root - cooked[5, 61, 105]. Boiled or roasted, they have a sweet flavour and are very nutritious[2, 115]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good garden soil but preferring a position in full sun[200]. Formerly cultivated for its edible seed[2]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. Herbaceous."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200]. Division in spring. It may not transplant well so care should be taken[200]."
