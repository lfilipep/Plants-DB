See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Berberis haematocarpa.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[85, 257]. Juicy and acidic[3], it is used mainly for making jams and jellies in N. America[11, 183]. It makes an acceptable raw fruit and is especially nice when added to porridges or muesli[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Dysentery  Ophthalmic  TonicInner wood shavings can be soaked in water to make an eyewash[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A green dye is obtained from the roots[168]. Yellow according to another report[257]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168].",,"Unlike most members of this genus, this species requires a dry, perfectly drained position in full sun, a gritty slightly acid soil is best[11, 200]. It grows best on a sunny south facing wall in Britain[11, 182] and does well in a hot, dry position[184]. It requires a position sheltered from strong or cold winds[202]. Plants are only hardy in the milder areas of the country, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c when fully dormant[1]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. The flowers are fragrant[245]. A very ornamental plant[1], but it does not fruit freely in Britain, the climate is too dull[11]. This species is very closely related to M. fremontii, being distinguished by the fruit which is blue-black in M. fremontii and red in M. haematocarpa[11, 67]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Resistant to honey fungus[88].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
