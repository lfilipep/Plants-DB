It can be found in Southeast Asia. When fully established, it is tolerant to drought. There is no edible part. Bark decoction is used against dysentery. The tree is a source of red resin which is used for caulking boats. The wood of this species is used for heavy construction, bows, etc.","Shorea siamensis is a deciduous Tree growing to 18 m (59ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Hopea suava Wall. ex A.DC.

See also Pitch and Oil.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses: A red resin is obtained from the tree[506 ]. It is used for caulking boats[730 ]/ The bark contains 9% tannin and the wood 6%. This is regarded as too little to be of commercial importance[404 ]. The heartwood is yellowish-brown turning to brownish-red or dark brown; it is clearly demarcated from the red sapwood[404 , 598 ]. Texture is medium to coarse. In comparison to most other species in this family, the wood is very hard, heavy, strong and very durable[46 , 404 , 451 ]. Graveyard tests have indicated a life of over 270 months for the wood, whilsr untreated sleepers have lasted for 15 years in the ground[404 ]. Sawing and working is rather difficult and the wood is quite tolerant to treatment, however it can take a good polish on a well finished surface[404 ]. It is used for heavy construction[46 , 404 ]. A highly prized wood, it is used for valuable furniture, house and long term construction, bows etc[506 , 598 ]. It is regarded as an excellent wood for sleepers[404 ].",,"A plant of lowland areas in the moist tropics, it grows at elevations from sea level to over 1,000 metres. It prefers a tropical monsoon climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1,250 - 2,000mm, with a well pronounced wet season and a dry season of up to 6 months[404 , 451 ] Requires a sunny position[404 ]. The plant has adapted to very dry conditions and mainly grows on shallow poor, and rocky sand soils, or on limestone soils with an acid to neutral pH[404 , 598 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[598 ]. The plant grows in areas that are often subject to forest fires. It has adapted to be able to survive these fires and by the time it is large it is very resistant[404 ]. In areas with high fire frequencies, the species grows shrubby until the root system is vigorous enough to send up a strong terminal shoot, which rapidly develops a thick rough, fire resistant bark at the base[404 ].","We have no specific information for this species - the information below is a general guide for the genus. Seed - best sown as soon as possible. It does not require pre-treatment, but it is recommended to soak the seed for 12 hours prior to sowing[325 ]. The seeds are sown in seedbeds, where they are covered with a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) or with a thin layer of sawdust[325 ]. Germination of fresh seeds is usually good and rapid. About two weeks after germination, when the seedlings are 5 - 6cm tall, they are potted up into individual containers about 15 x 23cm with good drainage holes at their base[325 ]. It is normally recommended to use a mixture of forest soil and sand (at a ratio of 3:1) as the potting medium in order to introduce the appropriate mycorrhiza to the roots. The seedlings are placed in 50 - 60% sunlight and watered twice daily[325 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 30 - 40cm tall - harden the seedlings off in full sunlight for one month prior to planting[325 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
