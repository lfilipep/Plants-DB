The form C. japonica alpina grows to about half the size of the species, it is especially suitable and can be planted about 1 metre apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Hedge, Massing, Woodland garden. Easily cultivated in any reasonably good soil[1]. Prefers a deep moist well-drained loam[4, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates full shade but requires a sunny position for best fruit production[3, 11, 200]. Becomes chlorotic on very alkaline soils[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -25°c[200] and fruits freely in Britain[11]. Plants are occasionally cultivated for their edible fruit[183].

Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in February in a greenhouse[78]. Germination usually takes place within 6 weeks[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If well grown, these seedling can be large enough to plant out in the summer, but give them some protection in their first winter. Otherwise plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Easy[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a cold frame. Layering in late spring or in autumn. This is a sure and easy method, though it takes 12 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in late winter[113]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
