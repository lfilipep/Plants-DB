24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a nutrient-rich well-drained moisture-retentive soil in a sunny position with shelter from cold drying winds, especially when young[200]. Requires a lime-free soil according to some reports[1, 134], but it thrives on a limy soil according to other reports[11, 182, 200]. Established plants are drought tolerant. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Dislikes being transplanted, it should be placed in its final position whilst young, giving some protection in its first winter outdoors[11, 134]. Plants are very slow growing. Most plants cultivated under this name are in fact A. x andrachnoides 'Serratula'[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best surface sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed should be soaked for 5 - 6 days in warm water and then surface sown in a shady position in a greenhouse[78]. Do not allow the compost to become dry. 6 weeks cold stratification helps[134]. The seed usually germinates well in 2 - 3 months at 20°c[134]. Seedlings are prone to damp off[184], they are best transplanted to individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and should be kept well ventilated. Grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts[K]. Basal cuttings in late winter[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November/December in a frame. Poor percentage[78]. Layering of young wood - can take 2 years[1, 200]."
