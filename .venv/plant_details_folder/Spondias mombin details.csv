Plant extracts exhibit antibacterial properties, and a decoction of the bark or root bark is considered antiseptic[303 ]. The roots are regarded as febrifuge[303 ]. An infusion is used to treat dysentery[348 ]. Leaf decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, colds, fevers and gonorrhoea[303 , 739 ]. The leaves are also used in an abortifacient preparation[348 ]. A decoction of the leaves and young stems is used as an eyewash in ophthalmia[348 , 739 ]. The flowers are cardiac and stomachic[739 ].

23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is occasionally planted to provide shade for coffee plants[331 ]. It is sometimes utilized for living fence posts[331 ]. Other Uses Ashes from the roots have been used in making soap[303 ]. The heartwood is cream to buff in colour; it is not demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain straight to slightly irregular; lustre is medium; there is no distinguishable odour or taste. The wood is light in weight, soft; it is somewhat durable, with a low resistance to attack by decay fungi and insects, and is particularly prone to blue stain. It air dries rapidly, but develops moderate warp and slight checking. It is easy to work and generally finishes smoothly, though fuzzy grain may develop in some operations. The trunks are occasionally used for dugouts and the stems for posts, boxes, matches, general carpentry, tool handles, millwork, utility plywood, and furniture components. Logs need to be promptly processed to minimize deterioration from insect attack[303 , 316 , 419 ]. Its hardness, density and light colour make the tree useful for wood pulp. The resulting paper has good resistance to tension and tearing but a poor reaction to folding[303 ]. The wood is suitable for fuel[303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"The plant grows best in the subhumid and frost-free tropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 1,000 metres[200 , 303 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 21 - 27°c, but can tolerate 13 - 35°c[418 ]. The plant is severely damaged by frost[303 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 600 - 2,800mm[418 ]. It can succeed in areas with widely distributed rainfall, or with a marked dry season[335 ]. Requires a sunny position[418 ]. Prefers a medium to heavy, well-drained, fertile soil[418 ]. Plants are not too fussy over soil, not needing very fertile conditions[200 ]. However, very poor soil, or shallow land, is unsuitable[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.3 - 8[418 ]. A fast-growing tree, easily reaching a height of 3.5 metres within 2 years from seed[419 ]. Fruiting usually starts when seedling trees are about 5 years of age, although well-kept cuttings may start fruiting earlier[303 , 335 ]. Some ripe fruit can be found on the tree during most of the year[303 ]. Plants produce a deep taproot when young and also have a shallower root system near the surface when older[303 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: White/Near White Cream/Tan."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - Fresh seeds germinate well. Seeds germinate within 35-75 days[303 ]. Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a semi-shaded position in individual containers. A high germination rate can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 40 days[419 ]. Seedlings develop rapidly and they should be ready to plant out less than 6 months later[419 ]. Quite large cuttings of wood from the previous season or older, often 50-100 cm long and 5-10 cm thick[303 ]."
