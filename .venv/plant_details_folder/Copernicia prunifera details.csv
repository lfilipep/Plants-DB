It has a circular tree crown. The flowers are bisexual. The fruits are round, small, and black. The plant, particularly the coating of the leaves, is a source of carnauba wax which is used to make varnishes, lubricant, soap, candles, etc. The fruit and pith are edible. The pith has high starch content and is used to make sago. The trunk also yields an edible gum. The leaves and the apical bud are both eaten as vegetable. The seed is used as coffee substitute and is a source of oil. The leaves are used as thatching and weaving material. Leaf fibres are made into ropes. The wood is used for fuel, poles, fencing, etc. The plant is drought resistant. Other names include wax palm and carnauba."

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - there is no need to separate the seeds from the fruit before sowing. If stored seed is used then pre-soak for 24 hours in warm water. Sow the seed in a lightly shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers[ 419 ]. The seed can take 2 - 3 months to germinate[ 297 ]. Sprouting is slow, with a low germination rate[ 419 ]. Young seedlings grow slowly[ 419 ]."
