0,Bursera simaruba,"Gum Tree, Gumbo Limbo",Burseraceae,10-12,None known,"Generally found in dry forests, but sometimes in wetter forests; common in advanced secondary growth[ 303 ]. In the wetter areas of its range it is more likely to be found growing on slopes where the soil is shallow and dries quickly[ 510 ].","S.

It has a single trunk that is smooth and red. The leaves are bright green and the flowers are creamy white. The fruits are edible succulent red berries. Medicinally, gum tree promotes sweating, urination, bowel movement, and healing of wounds. It is used as treatment for dropsy, dysentery and yellow fever. Gum tree leaves are tea substitute. The bark produces American elemi, otherwise known as cachibok or gomart, a balsam resin used in varnishes and as gum arabic substitute. It has many other uses such as glue, canoe paint, incense, and insect repellent. The wood is soft and light, ideal as veneer, plywood, rustic furniture, match sticks and toothpicks, cabinets, etc. When dried, it is used as firewood or charcoal.","Bursera simaruba is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 16 m (52ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Insects, especially bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Bursera gummifera L. Bursera ovalifolia (Schldl.) Engl.

Seaside, Street tree, Massed as an accent, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: Trees are used as living fence to delimit pastures, using stakes 1 - 3 metres long, 10 - 15cm thick, and spaced 3 metres or more apart[ 303 ]. Other Uses The bark yields a balsam resin known as American elemi, cachibok or gomart[ 303 ]. It is used in varnishes and as a substitute for gum arabic (from Acacia spp.)[ 46 ]. It is painted on canoes to preserve the wood from insects etc[ 46 ]. It is also used as a glue for mending broken china and glass[ 46 , 510 ]. Used by the Maya as an incense since ancient times[ 46 ], it is still concentrated, dried and used in modern South America as incense in churches[ 46 , 303 ]. The aromatic resin is a natural insect repellent, and no pests or diseases are reported for this species[ 303 ]. The heartwood is white, yellowish, or light brown; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. Both the heartwood and sapwood are often discoloured to a gray by sap-staining fungi[ 378 ]. The texture is fine to medium; the grain fairly straight; lustre is moderate and there is no distinctive taste or odour. The wood is soft, light in weight, firm, tough, not very durable in contact with the soil[ 378 ]. It works easily with all types of tools and machines; saws cleanly; planes to a smooth finish; drills cleanly with some tearing at the exit side; and turns readily on the lathe. The wood takes all stains and polishes well and holds nails firmly without splitting[ 378 ]. It is used for veneer, as plywood for interior use, in rustic furniture, for rough boxes and crates, as handles for tools, as soles for sandals, for match sticks and toothpicks, to build cabinets, to make decorative articles[ 303 ]. When thoroughly dry, the wood is used as firewood or charcoal[ 303 ]. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds","Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously.

It prefers areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 18 - 25°c, and the mean annual rainfall is 800 - 3,000mm[ 303 ]. Prefers a sunny position and a well-drained soil[ 200 ]. Grows on a range of soils, including Lithosols, Vertisols and Oxisols[ 303 ]. Succeeds in dry soils[ 303 ]. Established plants are drought resistant[ 510 ]. Plants can be pruned back very hard and will resprout successfully[ 510 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[ 200 ].",Seed. Forty per cent germination occurs within 20 days[ 303 ]. Seed storage behaviour is orthodox. Seeds remain viable for 10 months[ 303 ]. Cuttings root easily.
