20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing, short-lived pioneer species, it is able to support the harsh, adverse conditions created when the primary forest tree-cover is damaged or destroyed. Its ability to grow, even thrive, under such extreme circumstances is important to the process of forest succession. Cordia's rapid growth quickly establishes an anchoring root system as well as a sheltering crown that help to protect exposed soils and provide the more consistent regimes of humidity and temperature that are required by most other plant species[ 510 ]. Other Uses The wood is used for fence posts and in rural construction[ 333 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,A tropical plant. It grows in wet and moist forests.
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - very slow to germinate, the process can be sped up if the seed is scarified by lightly abrading the seedcoat to allow easier ingress of water[ 307 ]."
