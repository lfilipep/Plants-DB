Its ability to grow, even thrive, under such extreme circumstances is important to the process of forest succession. Cordia's rapid growth quickly establishes an anchoring root system as well as a sheltering crown that help to protect exposed soils and provide the more consistent regimes of humidity and temperature that are required by most other plant species[ 510 ].
