Stand the pot in about 3cm of water. Pot up young seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle, keep them wet by standing the pots in shallow water and overwinter for the first year in a greenhouse or cold frame. Division in spring just before growth starts[1]. Very easy, the plants can be divided at any time in the growing season and can be planted direct into their permanent positions[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
