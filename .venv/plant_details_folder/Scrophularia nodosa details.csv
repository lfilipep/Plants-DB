24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in most moist to wet soils in full sun or partial shade[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame[238]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed then it can be sown outdoors in situ in the autumn or the spring. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
