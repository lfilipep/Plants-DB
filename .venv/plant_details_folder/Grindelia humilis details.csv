This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species. The report on medicinal uses in [4] relates to G. cuniefolia, a name that has been used by two authors. G. cuniefolia. non Nutt. is said to be a synonym of G. humilis and so the entry has been made here."
