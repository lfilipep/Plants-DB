Prefers a rich loamy soil[1]. Fertile soils give good foliage effects but the plant flowers better on a poor soil[200]. Closely related to M. major, but smaller in all parts[200]. A very ornamental plant it is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1], flowering freely in Cornwall[59]. In colder parts of the country it can be grown as a herbaceous perennial, dying down in winter but regrowing from the base in the spring[166, 200]. In these areas the rootstock must be well mulched[200]. The top growth is possibly hardy for short periods down to -10°c, whilst the rootstock is possibly hardy to -15°c if it is well mulched[187]. Plants are often used in sub-tropical bedding schemes[1]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse[188]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on the seedlings for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts[K]. Cuttings of greenwood stem tips in a frame in summer[200]. Suckers in spring[200].
