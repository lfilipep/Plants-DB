14,Physical Characteristics,"Centranthus ruber is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves - raw or cooked as greens[2, 5, 52, 115]. Exceedingly good, either in salads or cooked as a vegetable[4]. This differs from our own experience, whilst the leaves can be added to salads they are rather bitter and rather less than desirable[8, 183, K]. Root - cooked[4]. Used in soups[4].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Miscellany  NervineRed valerian is sometimes confused in herbals and folk tradition with the true valerian (Valeriana officinalis). Whilst true valerian has a very strong action on the nervous system, this species has no known medical properties[244, 268]. The plant is nervine[148]. This report possibly confuses this plant with the true valerian, Valeriana officinalis, which is a very effective nervine.",
22,Other Uses,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,
23,Other Uses Description,"The seeds were used in ancient embalming[89, 148].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore. Grows well in ordinary moist, well-drained garden soil and on dry walls[1, 111, 200]. Prefers a sunny position[111], though it also succeeds in semi-shade[219]. Thrives on chalk[200], poor soils[188] and in sandy soils[187]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[187, 200]. Plants are generally long-lived and grow especially well in maritime areas, where they are a common feature of hedgerows and walls[219, K]. A very ornamental plant[1], it attracts moths and butterflies[30]. The flowers have an unpleasant smell like perspiration[245].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above, Fragrant flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February to May in situ or as soon as it is ripe in situ and only just cover the seed. Germination is usually rapid. Division in spring. Cuttings, summer, in a cold frame.",
