Forest openings at elevations of 1300 - 3000 metres in Nepal[272].",E. Asia - Himalayas.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ElaeagnusParvifolia.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ElaeagnusParvifolia2.gif",,"Elaeagnus parvifolia is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4.5 m (14ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",E. umbellata parvifolia. (Royle.)Schneid.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw, cooked or added to curries[2, 105, 183]. The fruit must be fully ripe before it can be enjoyed raw, if even slightly under-ripe it will be quite astringent - though children seem to love it at the slightly unripe stage[K]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200] and contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cancer  DysenteryThe unripe fruit is astringent and is eaten in the treatment of bloody dysentery[272]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].","Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it can be grown as an informal hedge in exposed positions[75].",,"Succeeds in most soils that are well-drained[11, 200]. Prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in very poor soils and in dry soils[11, 200]. Prefers a light sandy loam and a sunny position[11]. Dislikes shallow chalk soils[98]. Plants are very drought resistant[1] and very tolerant of maritime exposure[75]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -40°c[200]. Somewhat similar to E. multiflora, but flowering a few weeks later[182]. The flowers are rich in nectar and very aromatic, they are much visited by bees. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. Plants can fruit in 6 years from seed[160]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[160, 200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November in a frame. Leave for 12 months. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
