24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a damp peaty soil and a position in full sun[1, 164]. Another report says that it requires some shade[188]. Requires a lime-free soil[164]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 6 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. Ephemeral emerging in spring and dying back by summer every year  [1-2]. The root pattern is a corm swelling at the stem base [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow on a peat based compost in spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 4 weeks at 10°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Division of offsets in spring or autumn."
