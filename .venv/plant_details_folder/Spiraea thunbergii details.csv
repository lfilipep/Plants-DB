Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[11]. Succeeds in most soils, but requires a warm sheltered position if the wood is to ripen sufficiently to induce free flowering[184]. Hardy to about -20°c[184]. Plants flower on the previous summers growth and should be pruned immediately after flowering in order to promote new growth[182]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if possible. It is likely to require stratification before it germinates, so stored seed should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as you receive it. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a light sandy soil a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15cm long, October/November in an outdoor frame[200]. Another report says that September is a good time to do this[11]. Division of suckers in early spring[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
