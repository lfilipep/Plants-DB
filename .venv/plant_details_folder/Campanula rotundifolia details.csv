Form: Irregular or sprawling.","Campanula rotundifolia is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Meadow; Cultivated Beds;,Leaves - raw or cooked[K].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The root has been chewed in the treatment of heart and lung problems[257]. An infusion of the roots has been used as ear drops for a sore ear[257]. A decoction of the plant has been drunk or used as a wash in the treatment of sore eyes[257].,,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen. A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile well-drained soils[233, 271], though it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in poor soils[17]. This species can be naturalized in finer turfs, on grassy banks and in chalk downland and heath associations[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A very variable species in the wild[271]. When established, plants can spread fairly freely and also self-sow, though they are quite easily contained by hoeing[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A very ornamental plant, there are some named varieties[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Three or four weeks pre-chilling of the seed improves the germination rate[138]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can also be sown outdoors in situ during the spring. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
