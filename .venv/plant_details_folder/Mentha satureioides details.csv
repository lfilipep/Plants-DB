20,Medicinal Uses,"Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Alterative  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Blood purifier  Carminative  Digestive  Emmenagogue  TonicThe leaves and flowering plant are alterative, antispasmodic, blood purifier, digestive, emmenagogue and tonic[152, 154, 238]. A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used in the treatment of fevers, coughs, colds, headaches, digestive disorders, menstrual complaints and various minor ailments[152, 222, 238]. It can be used as a substitute for both pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) and peppermint (Mentha x piperita)[238]. Like those species, it should not be prescribed for pregnant women since it can procure an abortion[238]. The leaves are harvested as the plant comes into flower and can be dried for later use[238]. The essential oil in the leaves is antiseptic, though it is toxic in large doses[222] and can cause abortions[152, 154].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,An essential oil is obtained from the whole plant. It has a scent intermediate between pennyroyal and peppermint[238]. The plant is used as an insect repellent[154]. Rats and mice intensely dislike the smell of mint. The plant was therefore used in homes as a strewing herb and has also been spread in granaries to keep the rodents off the grain[244].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils and situations so long as the soil is not too dry[1, 16, 200]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[16]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A sunny position is best for production of essential oils, but it also succeeds in partial shade. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[238]. Most mints have fairly aggressive spreading roots and, unless you have the space to let them roam, they need to be restrained by some means such as planting them in containers that are buried in the soil[K]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. The whole plant has a mint-like aroma. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[24]. A good companion plant for growing near cabbages and tomatoes, helping to keep them free of insect pests. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Mentha species are very prone to hybridisation and so the seed cannot be relied on to breed true. Even without hybridisation, seedlings will not be uniform and so the content of medicinal oils etc will vary. When growing plants with a particular aroma it is best to propagate them by division[K]. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame. They will quickly become established and can be planted out in the summer.",
