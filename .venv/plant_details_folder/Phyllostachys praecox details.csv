See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",P. violascens Rivière & C.Rivière,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Young shoots - cooked. A delicious flavour[266]. This is one of the first species to be ready to eat in the spring, the young shoots are usually boiled in at least one change of water. The shoots, which are 4 - 6cm in diameter[266], are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,A recommended species for producing canes. Agroforestry Uses: This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants have shallow root systems that do not compete with deep tree roots[195].,,"Cultivated in the warm temperate and subtropical regions of southern China. In cultivation outside of China it has withstood temperatures down as low as -15°c for short periods.Succeeds in full sun and in partial shade. Species in this genus generally tolerate a wide range of soils and sites, though they prefer a damp humus-rich soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. They grow best in a position sheltered from cold winds[11]. Plants are generally not very tolerant of dry conditions[1].Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[K].Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. This pattern can vary - sometimes flowering is sporadic, with plants flowering annually and not dying; at other times it is gregarious with all the plants in a specific species coming into flower at the same time. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
