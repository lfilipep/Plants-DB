13,Summary,"Katrafay or Cedrelopsis grevei is a deciduous bush tree endemic from Madagascar. It is usually 28 m in height. The trunk is straight with diameter of about 60cm and can be unbranched for up to 9 m. The stem bark is bitter and aromatic. It is used in local rum and as an ingredient in non-alcoholic drinks. Katrafay is considered to be one of the most important medicinal trees. The bark and leaves yield essential oil that is used in traditional medicine particularly in the treatment of malaria, fever, and muscular fatigue. A stem bark extract is used for coughs, headache, asthma, tuberculosis, rheumatism, pneumonia, etc. The wood is used as construction material and for fuel and charcoal-making. It is resistant to fungal and insect attacks. C. grevei can be grown from seed or cuttings."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cedrelopsis grevei is a deciduous Tree growing to 22 m (72ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

19,Edible Uses Description,"and aromatic stem bark is used to aromatise local rum, and is also an ingredient of bitter, non-alcoholic drinks[ 299 ]. One of the most important medicinal trees in Madagascar, it is valued especially for the essential oil obtained from the bark (see medicinal uses below)."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiarthritic  Antiasthmatic  Antidiarrhoeal  Antirheumatic  Antitussive  Aphrodisiac  Febrifuge  Hypotensive  Malaria  Odontalgic  Parasiticide  TonicOne of the most important medicinal trees in Madagascar, it is valued especially for the essential oil obtained from the bark, but also has a wide range of other applications. There have been several studies carried out on the plant. The constituents of the essential oil can be extremely variable depending on the location of collection. The main components are ishwarane, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-copaene, beta-elemene and alpha-selinene[ 299 ]. The oils from the bark and the leaf were found to have a similar composition, but the relative percentages of some compounds notably differed[ 299 ]. Numerous coumarins have been isolated from the stem bark. One of these, cedrecoumarin A, showed agonistic activity on both alpha and beta-oestrogenic receptors as well as superoxide scavenging activity[ 299 ]. The hexane extract of the stem bark furthermore yielded triterpenoids, limonoid derivatives, pentanortriterpenoids, a hexanortriterpenoid and quassinoids[ 299 ]. The bark extract has been shown to induce a progressive decrease in blood pressure, which is partly due to the presence of coumarins[ 299 ]. A crude stem bark extract showed significant cicatrizing effect on skin ulcers, as well as antibacterial activity (e.g. against Staphylococcus albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activity (against Candida albicans)[ 299 ]. The essential oil obtained from the bark is commonly used in massaging to treat general body pain, toothache, broken bones, muscular pain, arthritis and rheumatism, and a massage of the back is given to treat tiredness and fever. It is also used in baths for these purposes. Its tonic effects as well as its aphrodisiac effects are well appreciated, as it is considered to improve physical and mental fitness[ 299 ]. A stem bark extract is traditionally taken against cough, asthma, tuberculosis, pneumonia, diabetes, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rheumatism, intestinal worms, headache, tiredness and as a post-partum tonic. It is also used as a vaginal shower after childbirth for its tonic effects, and is externally applied to wounds and skin infections[ 299 ]. Sometimes a root bark decoction is taken to treat diarrhoea or asthma[ 299 ]. A vapour bath of the leaves is taken to treat weakness of the blood vessels, headache and a sore throat[ 299 ]. The seeds are chewed as an anthelmintic and to treat stomach-ache[ 299 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Other Uses: An essential oil is obtained from the bark. It is mainly used medicinally[ 299 ]. The heartwood is pale yellow to pale brown, somewhat mottled and slightly darker than the 25mm wide band of whitish sapwood. The grain is usually straight; texture fine. The wood is scented and contains resin cells. The wood is very heavy, very hard, flexible. It works fairly well with hand and machine tools, but has a marked blunting effect and stellite-tipped sawteeth are needed. Splitting on nailing and screwing is common, and pre-boring is recommended. The wood glues, polishes, waxes, varnishes and paints well. It is reputed for its resistance to wood rot and insect attack. The sapwood is susceptible to Lyctus borers. The heartwood is very resistant to impregnation. The wood has a wide range of used, being employed in heavy construction, carving, cabinet work, tool handles, interior joinery, interior trim, heavy parquet flooring, sliced veneer, plywood, ship and boat building, railway sleepers, vehicle bodies, electricity and construction poles and cattle enclosures. Because of its hardness and resistance to fungal and insect attack, it is considered imperishable and it is traditionally used for making royal Sakalava tombs[ 299 ]. The wood is used for fuel and for making charcoal[ 299 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Found in the wild on a wide variety of soil types, often on red or yellow sandy soils, but it grows taller in river valleys than on plateau soils[ 299 ]. The tree grows slowly, with annual increments in height of less than 50cm per year. It reaches a height of 50 - 300cm by the age of 7 years[ 299 ]. It is estimated to need over 40 years to produce a small pole[ 299 ]. This species can be either monoecious or dioecious. If dioecious, then both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[ 299 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - a high germination rate when sown fresh and directly into the field[ 299 ]. Cuttings.
