24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Succeeds in most fertile moist but well-drained soils in a sheltered sunny position[231]. Tolerant of poor dry soils[200]. This species tolerates several degrees of frost if it is growing in a dry sunny climate[200]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also often be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. Special Features:North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse at not less than 24°c[188]. Germination of fresh seed usually takes place in 3 - 4 months at 25°c[138]. Stored seed is very slow to germinate. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing may shorten the germination time. Plants form a long tap-root some time before forming a shoot so it is best to sow 2 - 3 seeds per deep pot. Grow the seedlings on in the greenhouse for at least their first three winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
