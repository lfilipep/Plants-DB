25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Coppice  Other Systems: Multistrata  Regional CropClimate: Tropical. Humidity: Humid. There are an estimated 400 species in this genus, all native to tropical and subtropical Asia, Africa, and Australia. They are mostly leaf-climbing lianas with slender, reedy stems. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. .",
26,Plant Propagation,"Most species in this genus are more or less vigorous climbing plants in rainforests. In general, they are likely to grow best with their roots in the shade but with their stems able to grow up to the light. They are also likely to grow best in a humus-rich soil[ K ].
