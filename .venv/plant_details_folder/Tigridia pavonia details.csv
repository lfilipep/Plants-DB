Likes plenty of moisture in the growing season[188]. Corms are not hardy outside the milder areas of Britain and should be dug up in the autumn and stored in a cool but frost free place over winter[1]. Plant out the corms in April or May about 15cm deep[79]. In areas with cool summers the plant might not manage to develop adequate corms for subsequent growing[200]. A beautiful, late flowering corm, it self-sows freely with us on a well-drained soil in Cornwall, even very wet winters do not seem to affect this plant[K]. Plants flower in their first or second year from seed[K].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. It usually germinates freely. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring, after the last expected frosts. If the seedlings are potted up whilst still small and grown on quickly, they sometimes flower in their first year[K]. Division of offsets in the autumn. Store the corms in a cool but frost-free place and plant them out in the late spring. It is probably best to pot up the smaller corms and grow them on in a greenhouse for a year before planting them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
