24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen. Succeeds in any good loamy soil[1, 11] and in dry soils. Prefers a sunny sheltered position[1, 11]. A wind resistant plant, but it does not like salt-laden winds[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. This species is hardy to about -10°c when fully dormant[200], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Grows best in areas with long hot summers, it is fast growing in such conditions[200]. A short-lived tree[11]. A good bee plant[108]. Plants are susceptible to coral spot fungus, especially if the wood is not properly ripened due to insufficient summer heat[11]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. It is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water. If it swells up then sow it in a cold frame. If it does not swell then soak it for a further 24 hours in hot water prior to sowing. This should cause the seed to swell but, should this fail, scarification (taking care not to damage the seed embryo) followed by a further 24 hours in warm water should do the trick[80]. Germination is usually good[78], though the seedlings are very variable[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors[78]. Root cuttings, 4cm taken in December. Plant horizontally in individual pots in a warm greenhouse[78].",
