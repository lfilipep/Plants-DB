It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",D. richardsonii. (Sw.)Schulz. Sophia incisa.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Young leaves - cooked. A bitter taste[85]. Seed - raw or cooked[46, 105]. The seed can be used as a mustard substitute in soups, stews etc. It can be roasted, ground into a powder then mixed with water to make a fine batter and drunk[257]. The seed is also ground into a meal and mixed with cereal flours when making bread, or as a thickening for soups etc[61, 85].","Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PoulticeThe plant has been used as a lotion for parts of the body that have become frozen in the cold and also as a lotion for sore throats[257]. No more information is given, but it is likely that the crushed seed was used for this since, being similar to mustard, it will probably have a rubefacient effect upon the skin, drawing more blood to that area of the body and thereby heating it[K]. The plant is mashed and applied to bad cuts[257].",,None known,,We have almost no information on this species but since it is a casual in Britain there should be no problems in cultivating it here and it is probably not too fussy about soil or situation. We suggest growing it in a dry to moist soil in a sunny position. There is some confusion as to the correct name for this species with some authorities using the name D. richardsonii.,Seed - sow spring in situ.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
