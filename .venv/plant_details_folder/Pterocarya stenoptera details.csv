22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a rich strong loam with abundant moisture at the roots[11, 200]. Succeeds in areas that do not experience prolonged winter temperatures below about -12°c[200], but young plants and the young shoots of older trees can be cut back by winter frosts[11]. Plants are tolerant of compacted soils[200]. The leaves are resinous to the touch and emit a resinous aroma[245]. The root system of this tree is too invasive for small gardens[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[80, 113]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water[80] then cold stratify for 2 - 3 months[98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year[240]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Cuttings of mature shoots, November in a frame. Only use vigorous shoots[113]. Layering. Division of suckers in the dormant season[188].",
