25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moderately fertile wet soil or in shallow water[1, 200]. Prefers cool summers[200]. Plants are occasionally cultivated for their edible leaves in Japan[61]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow autumn in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it can be grown in situ in the autumn or spring. Division in autumn or spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots root easily in the growing season, merely put them in water."
