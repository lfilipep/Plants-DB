13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Fraxinus latifolia is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Febrifuge  VulneraryThe pulverised fresh roots were used by some native North American Indian tribes to treat serious wounds[213, 257]. A cold infusion of the twigs has been used to treat fevers[257]. The bark is anthelmintic[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A fairly wind resistant tree, it can be grown as part of a shelterbelt planting[200].  - hard, brittle, light, coarse grained. A valuable timber tree, it is largely used for making furniture, the interiors of buildings, cooperage etc, and as a fuel[46, 61, 82, 171]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. Plants succeed when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. They tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. A fast growing tree for its first 75 years in the wild, it then grows slowly reaching a maximum age of 250 years[229]. This species is closely related to F. pennsylvanica[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds."
