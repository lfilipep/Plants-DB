The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - raw or cooked[105, 161].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",The plant is a good soil stabilizer in its natural environment[200].,,"We have very little information for this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. Some botanists have now renamed this plant, moving it into a new genus as Psoralidium tenuiflorum[274]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1]. Requires a well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants are very intolerant of root disturbance, they are best planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early to mid spring in a greenhouse. Either sow the seed in individual pots or pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible in order to avoid root disturbance. Grow them on in the pots until planting out in their final positions. It is usually impossible to transplant this species without fatal damage to the root[200]. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. It is virtually impossible to divide this species successfully[200].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
