24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile, moisture-retentive but well-drained soil, requiring a warm sheltered position in full sun[200, 260]. When grown in warm Temperate zones, this species can withstand short periods of temperatures as low as -5°c[200]. In Britain, it is only likely to succeed outdoors in the very mildest parts of the country, and even then would probably require the protection of a south-facing wall. There are some cultivars, developed for their ornamental value[200]. 243034",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water then sow in mid spring in a greenhouse. When large enough t handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer, after the last expected frosts and consider giving some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, with the leaves removed, in moist sand July/August in a frame[200]. Gentle bottom heat is usually required. Layering.",
