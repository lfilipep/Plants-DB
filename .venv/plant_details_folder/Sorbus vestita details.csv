4,Known Hazards,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most reasonably good soils in an open sunny position[11]. Tolerates light shade[188], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188]. A very ornamental tree[11], unfortunately the fruit is not freely borne in Britain[11]. Plants are apt to die back without any warning[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring."
