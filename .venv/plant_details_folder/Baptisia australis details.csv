14,Physical Characteristics,"Baptisia australis is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf from May to October, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  Appetizer  Digestive  Emetic  PurgativeAppetizer, digestive[61]. The root is antiemetic, emetic and purgative[222, 257]. There are confusing reports from two sources that the plant is used as an emetic and also that a cold tea is given to stop vomiting[222, 257]. A poultice of the root is anti-inflammatory and is held in the mouth to treat toothaches[222]. The plant is under investigation as a potential stimulant of the immune system[222]."

21,Other Uses Description,"A blue dye is obtained from the plant[257]. No more information is given, but it is likely to be the leaves that are used[K]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Seashore. Prefers a deep, well-drained neutral to slightly acid soil in full sun[188, 200]. Grows freely in a loamy soil[1]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in a rich moist soil in sun or light shade[187]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. A very ornamental species, but it is somewhat shy flowering in British gardens[1]. Plants have a very deep root system and dislike root disturbance, they should be left alone once they are established[188, 233]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water and then sown in a cold frame in late winter or early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer or following spring. Division in spring[188]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.
