Main Bloom Time: Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Irregular or sprawling, Rounded.","Fuchsia magellanica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3.6 m (11ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",F. gracilis. F. macrostemma.

A juicy berry[K], it is not very palatable[105, 177].","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Very resistant of maritime exposure and tolerant of trimming it makes a good informal hedge in mild maritime areas[29, 75, 166]. The variety 'Riccartonii' is commonly used[200]. The cultivar 'Prostrata' forms a carpet of growth and can be used as a ground cover when planted about 60cm apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Specimen. Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil, preferring one that is rich in humus[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers cool moist conditions and some shade[1, 15]. Succeeds in a good loam if leafmold and sand are added[1]. This species is very resistant to maritime exposure, it can be grown right on the coast[75, 166]. The top growth is hardy to about -10°c[184], this can be cut right back to the ground in severe winters but the plants usually recover well, growing away quickly in the late spring and flowering by late summer[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. The sub-species F. magellanica myrtifolia often bears a very large crop of fruit[K]. The cultivar 'Ricartonii' can be hardy fairly well north in Britain. A lovely specimen 3 metres tall was seen growing in dappled shade of trees in the Monastery Gardens in York[K]. A very ornamental plant, it is a parent of most of the hardy ornamental fuchsia varieties[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Plants are pollinated by humming birds in the wild, they are good bee plants in Britain[108]. Special Features:Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
