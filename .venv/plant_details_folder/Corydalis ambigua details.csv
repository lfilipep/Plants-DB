24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist, well-drained rather light soil, thriving in semi-shade[1]. Grows well in a woodland garden or peat bed[129]. This species is very closely related to and probably part of C. fumariifolia[175]. It is probably not really worthy of specific status and is best treated as a cultivar, C. 'Ambigua'[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, the seed rapidly loses viability if it is allowed to become dry[129]. Surface sow and keep moist, it usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. Germinates in spring according to another report[129]. Two months warm, then a cold stratification improves the germination of stored seed[134, 164]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be allowed to grow undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Apply liquid feed at intervals during their growing season to ensure they are well fed. The seedlings only produce one leaf in their first year of growth[175] and are very prone to damping off[129]. Divide the seedlings into individual pots once they have become dormant and grow them on in a partially shaded area of a greenhouse for at least another year. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant. Division in spring after flowering. Once the plants are dying down, dig up the clump and divide the tubers, planting them out straight into their permanent positions if required."
