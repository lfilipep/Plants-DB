It does Poorly in high Heat and high Humid conditions (e.g. southeast USA).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20?c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until the seedlings are large enough to plant out, which could take a few years. Seed is rarely available. Division in late spring[25]. Best done as the new shoots first appear above ground[25]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings[25].",
