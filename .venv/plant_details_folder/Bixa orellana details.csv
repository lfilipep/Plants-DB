It is named as such due to its crown composed of cluster of fan-shaped leaves. It is a dioecious species. The leaves are reportedly aphrodisiac and roots are used as mouthwash and against stomach parasites, bronchitis, sore throats and asthma. The fruit is edible fresh, dried, or cooked. Fruit juice can be obtained from immature fruits. Moreover, young seedlings, the tuberous portion of the first juvenile leaves, and the apical bud and young leaves are all consumed as vegetable. Sap can also be obtained from the plant and made into palm wine or vinegar. The leaves are used in thatching and as materials in making baskets and mats. The tree is an excellent fire break and is drought-resistant.

The seeds are relatively tasteless[ 302 ]. They are briefly steeped in hot oil which is then strained and cooled to be used as a flavouring in various dishes[ 301 ]. The whole seeds can be ground into a paste with various other spices, which gives a more pronounced flavour[ 301 ]. The seeds have a high nutritive value, containing a small amount of fatty oil (5%) and about 13% of protein[ 299 ]. The ground seed is red and this can be used to colour foods[ 301 ]. A yellow colour is obtained from the seed coat, and this is widely used as a colouring in margarines etc in the food industry[ 301 ]. It is a harmless, non-carcinogenic dye[ 303 ] . It colours butter, margarine, cheese, and chocolate. It is ground and used as a spice (Annatto) in South America.","Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth.

A decoction of the leaves is used as a treatment for dysentery[ 348 ], and to reduce vomiting during pregnancy[ 739 ]. The leaves are applied to the head and to sprains to relieve aches[ 303 ]. A decoction is gargled as a cure for mouth and throat infections. The leaves may also be used in baths to relieve muscular aches, fevers, colic or to get rid of worms in children[ 303 , 348 ]. The fresh shoots are steeped in water, which is then used as a eyewash for inflamed eyes[ 739 ]. The leaves can be picked as required and used fresh or dried[ 238 ]. The sap from the leaf petiole is soaked in hot water with rum, then used to remove secretions from encrusted eyelids as a treatment for blepharitis[ 348 ]. Young shoots are applied locally as a poultice on abscesses[ 348 ]. The roots are digestive and diuretic[ 739 ]. A decoction is taken orally to control asthma[ 303 ]. An infusion of the root in water and rum is used to treat venereal diseases[ 303 ]. A tea made from the root is used to treat oliguria and jaundice[ 303 ]. The seeds are used as an aphrodisiac, emmenagogue, expectorant and vermifuge[ 303 , 348 , 739 ]. They are used to treat asthma and nasal cavity problems[ 348 ]. A macerated seed decoction is taken orally for the relief of fevers[ 303 ]. In a syrup, they are used in the treatment of pharyngitis and bronchitis[ 739 ]. The ground seeds are applied to burns in order to prevent blistering and scarring[ 238 ]. The seeds are harvested as the fruits split open, and can be dried for later use[ 238 ]. They can also be soaked in hot water - the resulting sediment is pressed into cakes for use in medicines and dyes[ 238 ]. The pulp surrounding the seed is made into an astringent drink used to treat cancer, dysentery and kidney infections[ 238 , 303 ]. The fruit pulp is used as a rub on the skin to prevent sores, probably from sunburn[ 348 ]. The dye obtained from the seed coat is used as an antidote for prussic acid poisoning caused by eating poorly treated Manihot esculenta[ 238 , 303 ]. Sap from the bark and crushed leaves is used as a treatment for skin rashes[ 348 ]. A decoction of the bark is used as a treatment for malaria; angina and asthma[ 348 ]. The leaves contain cyanidine and ellagic acid[ 348 ].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Friction sticks: Used for starting fires when there are no matches.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Houseplant: A plant grown indoors for decorative purposes.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps.

Small flowering tree,  plant, Planter, Accent, Flower Border, Screening, Conservatory. Suitable for growing indoors. Agroforestry Uses: The plant is amenable to pruning and can be grown as a hedge[ 302 , 418 ]. Plants are tolerant of hard trimming[ 200 ]. Other Uses A red dye, known as annatto, is obtained from the fruit[ 302 ]. The dye is obtained from the seed coat[ 418 ]. The dye is used to colour cloth, and is also used by native people as a cosmetic for painting the skin and as a lipstick[ 302 ]. It is also used in the cosmetic production of nail gloss, hair oil, lipstick and soap, as well as in the production of floor wax, furniture and shoe polish[ 418 ]. The colour rapidly fades when exposed to light and air[ 303 ]. A waxy substance that has paralytic action on mammalian intestinal parasites is present in the seed coat[ 303 ]. Bixin extracted from the seed coat is used in India as an insect repellent[ 303 ]. The red dye obtained from the seed is applied to the skin to repel mosquitoes and other biting insects[ 348 , 739 ]. Annatto paste filters out the ultraviolet rays of sunlight, thereby protecting the skin from excessive sunburn[ 303 ]. The bark from the branches of the trees yields a water-soluble gum that is similar to gum arabic[ 303 ]. The seeds contain a characteristic pleasant-smelling essential oil[ 303 ]. It is said that fire can be started by the friction of 2 pieces of the soft wood[ 303 ]. A fibre for cordage has been obtained from the bark of the tree[ 303 , 418 , 454 ]. The sapwood is whitish and the heartwood light brown or yellowish. The wood is soft, light in weight (specific gravity 0.4), porous, weak and not durable[ 303 ]. The stems and branches are used for fuel[ 320 ].","Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Industrial Crop: Dye: Botanical dyes replacing synthetic dyes (known as heavy polluters).,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Industrial Crop: Gum: Used as thickeners and gelling agents.

It can grow at elevations from sea level up to 2,200 metres in tropical to subtropical climates where a mean annual rainfall of 2,500 - 5,000mm is distributed throughout the year[ 303 ]. It can withstand droughts of up to 4 months, but thrives best with well distributed rainfall and a dry season for seed ripening[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual temperature in the range 28 - 32°c, with a mean maximum temperature of 22 - 27°c and a mean minimum temperature of 18 - 26°c[ 303 ]. An easily grown plant, it succeeds on almost all soil types, preferring a moist, but well-drained neutral or slightly alkaline soil in a sunny position[ 301 , 303 ]. Prefers a slightly acid soil according to another report[ 307 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[ 418 ]. It grows into a larger tree when planted in deeper and more fertile soil, rich in organic matte[ 303 ]. Plants commence fruiting when quite young[ 200 ]. Trees can commence bearing fruit when only 2 years old[ 377 , 418 ]. Seed-grown plants take longer to flower than vegetatively propagated ones, and do so sparingly. Under favourable conditions, fruiting commences 18 months from planting or earlier, and full crops of seeds are obtained after 3 - 4 years[ 303 ]. Seed yields reach their peak when the trees are 4 - 5 years of age, usually a decline become evident around 12 years, but productivity can continue for up to 20 years[ 418 ]. Seed yields from 0.5 - 5 tonnes/ha per year have been reported, but usually yields are between 800 - 1,500 kg/ha[ 418 ]. 20 - 50g of dye can be obtained from 1 kilo of seed[ 418 ]. In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, flowering occurs mainly in spring and fruiting chiefly in the summer[ 303 ]. In some areas the tree can produce flushes of fruits at several times through the year[ 377 ].","Seed - the plant is usually grown from seed taken from freshly gathered ripe pods, which germinate better than dry ones[ 303 ]. Mature seeds, taken directly from fresh fruits, germinate readily in 7 - 10 days under moist conditions[ 299 ]. Seed is sown directly in the field, 2 - 5 seeds per hole in well-prepared soil, usually at the beginning of the rainy season. After germination only one seedling per hole is retained[ 299 ]. Seedlings may also be raised in planting trays; they are transferred to 1 kg bags containing a soil mixture and kept in the nursery for 3 - 4 months before they are transplanted into the field[ 299 ]. Cleaned, sun-dried seeds retain viability for over one year, but their germination rate falls to 12% in 3 years[ 299 ] Cuttings in sand. Hardwood cuttings of 8mm or more in diameter readily root when a root hormone suitable for hardwood cuttings is applied. Roots are produced in abundance in 7 - 9 weeks. Rooted cuttings are first transferred into pots or bags and kept in a nursery and can be transplanted to the field after 3 months[ 299 ]. Propagating by cuttings allows selection of high-yielding, rapidly growing cultivars that flower early and profusely and bear fruit within 2 years[ 303 ].
