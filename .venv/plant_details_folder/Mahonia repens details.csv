18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Oil: ",
19,Edible Uses Description,"it - raw or cooked[85, 183]. An acid flavour but it is rather nice raw, especially when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. Used for making jams. jellies etc. They can also be made into a refreshing lemonade-like beverage[183]. When sugar is added, the fruit juice is similar to grape juice[212]. The fruit is about 9mm in diameter[200].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anaphrodisiac: Reduces sexual desire.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Anaphrodisiac  Antibacterial  Antiseptic  Antitumor  Cholagogue  Depurative  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Laxative  Salve  TonicThe root and root bark is alterative, anaphrodisiac, antiseptic, cholagogue, depurative, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, laxative and tonic[4, 238]. It improves the digestion and absorption and is taken internally in the treatment of coughs, fevers, psoriasis, syphilis, haemorrhages, stomach complaints, kidney problems and impure blood conditions[4, 238, 257]. Externally, it is used as an antiseptic and healing wash or poultice on wounds and rheumatic joints[257]. The roots are harvested in late autumn or early spring and dried for later use[238]. A poultice of the fresh berries has been applied to boils[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark of the stem and roots[155, 257]. It is green[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. Plants form suckers freely, making a good dense ground cover[11, 200], though they can be slow to become established[197] and will need weeding for their first few years after planting out[K]. The sub-species M. repens rotundifolia has been especially recommended[197]. A useful plant for preventing soil erosion on slopes[155].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing. An easily grown plant, it thrives in any good garden soil[11], preferring one on the dryish side. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in the light shade of trees[K]. This species is hardy to about -15°c if growing in a sheltered position[184]. Established plants sucker freely and form quite dense thickets[200]. The flowers are scented[245]. Resistant to honey fungus[88]. Special Features:North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 3. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11]. Leaf cuttings in the autumn.",
