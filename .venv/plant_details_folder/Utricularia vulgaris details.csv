24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A free-floating water plant[188], it requires acid conditions[200] and is most commonly found in deep water[17]. This species can become a noxious weed in rice paddies[274]. An insectivores plant[200]. The plant possesses bladders with trap doors. Most of the water is pumped out of the bladder, resulting in a lower pressure inside the bladder than outside. When a tiny (usually microscopic) creature touches one of the trigger hairs on the door, the door opens allowing water to rush in and carry the animal with it - the process taking just a small fraction of a second. The trap door closes and the animal is digested by the plant[274]. An aggregate species[17]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe on the surface of a pot of acid compost that is immersed in water. Division should be possible in the growing season[188].
