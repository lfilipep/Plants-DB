13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cotoneaster racemiflorus is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.4 m (7ft 10in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, midges. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems."
19,Edible Uses Description,"s a manna-like substance called shir-khist, it is rich in sugars[46, 61, 183]. It contains about 13% sacchrose, 37.5% dextrose[105, 183]. No details of which part of the plant yields the manna, it is most likely to be the stem."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Aperient: A mild laxative.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Aperient  Expectorant  StomachicThe plant is aperient, expectorant and stomachic[240]."
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,A rose-tan dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. The wood is used in basket making.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a good soil but also does well in poor soils[1, 11, 200]. It thrives in lime and is also happy in peaty soils[1]. It succeeds in any soil that is not marshy or waterlogged[11, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade but does not fruit so freely in a shady position[11, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. There are several sub-species[200]. The flowers, when inhaled near to, have an unpleasant smell like decaying fish[245]. They are very attractive to bees whilst the fruit is a good winter food source for many species of birds[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Members of this genus hybridize freely so, if you require seed that breeds true, it is important to obtain it from a known wild source or from a controlled fertilization of garden plants. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it will usually germinate in the spring[11, 200]. Stored seed germinates faster if given 3 months warm stratification at 15°c and then 3 months cold stratification at 4°c[164]. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 18 months at 15°c but it can take 2 years[164]. Pot the seedlings up as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into nursery beds or into their permanent positions when they are more than 10cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel, November in a frame."
