0,Elaeagnus latifolia,Bastard Oleaster,Elaeagnaceae,8-11,None known,"Swamps, to elevations of 1500 metres in the Himalayas[146, 158]. Forest openings at elevations of 1500 - 2600 metres in Nepal[272].",E. Asia - India.,(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Elaeagnus latifolia 240.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Elaeagnus latifolia is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[146, 272]. Acid and somewhat astringent[158, 183], it is mainly used in preserves, pies etc[183]. Another report describes it as acid and pleasantly refreshing[146]. The fruit must be fully ripe before it can be enjoyed raw, if even slightly under-ripe it will be quite astringent[K]. The fruit contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cancer  CardiacThe flowers are astringent and cardiac[240, 243]. The fruit is astringent[240, 243]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].","Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.",The wood is a good fuel[146].,,"Succeeds in most soils that are well-drained[200]. Prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in poor soils and in dry soils[11, 200]. Requires a sunny position[11, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain and is unlikely to succeed outdoors even in the milder areas of the country[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. (This information on stratification is probably not appropriate to this species since it does not experience much frost in its native habitat[K]). The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, October/November in a frame[200]. The cuttings are rather slow and difficult to root, leave them for 12 months[113]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
