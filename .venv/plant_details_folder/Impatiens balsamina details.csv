0,Impatiens balsamina,"Rose Balsam, Spotted snapweed, Touch-Me-Not, Garden Balsam",Balsaminaceae,Coming soon,"Regular ingestion of large quantities of these plants can be dangerous due to their high mineral content[172]. This report, which seems nonsensical, might refer to calcium oxalate. This mineral is found in I. capensis and so is probably also in other members of the genus. It can be harmful raw but is destroyed by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant[K]. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet[238].",Waste places in and around villages[260].,"E.

Another report says that this species requires warm, moist conditions[260]. Succeeds in sun or semi-shade[188]. Plants are not frost hardy, but can be grown outdoors in Britain by sowing the seed in a greenhouse and planting out after the last expected frosts. A polymorphic species[1], there are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. This plant has seed capsules that spring open forcibly as the seed ripens to eject the seed a considerable distance. The capsules are sensitive to touch even before the seed is ripe, making seed collection difficult but fun[K]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse.
