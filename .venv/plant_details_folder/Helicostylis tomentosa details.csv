The crown is narrow and elongated. The fruit is yellow and globose, with a delicious flavor. It is usually eaten raw. Medicinally, the bark is used as a remedy for stomach cramps and pain accompanying a high fever. Bark extracts have been pharmaceutically evaluated and are reported to show depressant effects on the central nervous system. The tree yields yellow latex. The wood is moderately heavy, durable, and resistant to insect attacks. It is easy to work and ideal for general construction, lathe work, and furniture."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw. A delicious flavour[625 ]. The yellow, more or less globose fruit can be around 3cm in diameter[625 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hallucinogenic: Causes the mind to hallucinate.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  Hallucinogenic  StomachicThe red, milky sap from the bark is drunk as an hallucinogen in order to contact the spirits[348 ]. The rasped bark, mixed with alcohol, is used as a remedy for stomach cramps and pain accompanying a high fever[348 ]. Extracts prepared from the inner bark have been pharmacologically evaluated and are reported to elicit central nervous system depressant effects; and certain of the effects are described as being similar to those expected with Cannabis sativa. Because of the close taxonomic relationship of this species to Cannabis, one might expect similar types of chemical constituents in both genera. Whether or not the effects are due to the presence of cannabinoids remains to be determined[630 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The tree contains a yellow latex[625 ]. The heartwood is dark brown, somewhat streaked or variegated with black and yellow; it is sharply demarcated from the wide band of golden, lustrous sapwood. Lustre is medium in the heartwood; texture medium; grain straight to roey; without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is moderately heavy, with very good mechanical properties, durable and resistant to wood-eating insects. It is rated fair to good in all machining operations but does cause excessive dulling of cutting edges; takes a high natural polish. Easy to work, it is used in general construction for purposes such as scantlings, beams, door and window frames, floors etc; also for lathe work and making furniture[316 , 625 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Young plants require the dappled shade of the woodland, but become more tolerant of light as they grow larger, eventually accepting full sun[625 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[625 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A low germination rate can generally be expected, with the seed sprouting within 40 - 60 days[625 ]."
