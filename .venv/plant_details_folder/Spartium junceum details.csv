Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Early fall, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Rounded, Upright or erect.","Spartium junceum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3.5 m (11ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from June to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Genista juncea. G. odorata.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,None known,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Emetic  PurgativeThe young herbaceous tips of flowering shoots are harvested in spring, generally in May[4]. They can be used fresh or dried and are cardiotonic, cathartic, diuretic, emetic and purgative[4, 7, 89]. The seeds can also be used[4]. The plant is an efficacious and potent diuretic[7]. This plant is 5 - 6 times more active than the medicinally similar Cytisus scoparius and should be used with caution since large doses are likely to upset the stomach and cause purging[4].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Besom: A type of broom.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.","A fibre from the stems is a hemp substitute[148]. It is used to make thread, cordage and coarse fabrics[4, 7, 11, 61, 89, 160, 169]. It is also used for stuffing pillows etc and for making paper[46]. The smaller stems are used in basket making[7, 46, 61, 89, 160]. The branches are often made into brooms[7]. A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[7, 89, 148, 169]. An essential oil is obtained from the flowers, it is used in perfumery[46, 61]. 1200kg of flowers yields 300 - 350gr absolute[46].","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Regional CropLandscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen. Succeeds in any well-drained but not too fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Prefers a lime free soil according to one report[1] whilst another says that it thrives on alkaline and poor sandy soils[200]. Very wind resistant, tolerating maritime exposure[166, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200] and thrives on hot dry banks[11, 166]. A very ornamental plant, it is hardy to between -10 and -18°c when in a suitable position[200]. The flowers have a fragrance that has been likened to oranges[245]. Plants can become leggy if grown in a sheltered position or too rich a soil[200], but they can be pruned almost to the ground and will resprout from the base[K]. They can also be trimmed in early spring in order to keep them more compact[188]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance, they are best grown in pots and planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small[11]. Plants often self-sow in Britain[1]. Rabbits love eating this plant when it is young[1, K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - pre-soak 24 hours in hot water and sow February/March in a greenhouse. It usually germinates well and quickly[78, 200]. The seed can also be autumn sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant out in the summer, otherwise overwinter them in a cold frame and plant out in late spring of the following year.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
