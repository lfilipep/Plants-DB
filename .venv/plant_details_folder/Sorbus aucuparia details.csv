0,Sorbus aucuparia,"Mountain Ash, European mountain ash",Rosaceae,3-6,"Large quantities of the raw fruit can cause vomiting, especially if people are not used to the fruit. Seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. this is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Woods, scrub and mountain rocks, mainly on lighter soil, rare or absent on clays or soft limestones. It is found at higher elevations than any other native tree[17].","Europe, including Britain, south and east from Iceland to Spain, Macedonia and the Caucasus.",(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SorbusAucuparia.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SorbusAucuparia2.jpg","Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Upright or erect.","Sorbus aucuparia is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 7 m (23ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Pyrus aucuparia,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ","Oil: Oil,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Oil: ,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","aFruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The fruit is very acid and large quantities of the raw fruit can cause stomach upsets[10, 13]. It can be used to make delicious, if slightly acidulous, jams and preserves[7], the fruit can also be dried and used as a flour mixed with cereals[2, 66]. The fruit is about 7.5mm in diameter[200] and is produced in quite large bunches making harvest easy[K]. The leaves and flowers are used as a tea substitute[61, 183]. Young leaves are said to be a famine food but they contain a cyanogenic glycoside so you should be very hungry before even thinking of eating them[179]. A coffee substitute[183]. The report was referring to the fruit, it probably means the roasted seed.","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiscorbutic: A plant rich in vitamin C that is used to counteract scurvy.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antiscorbutic  Aperient  Astringent  Diuretic  Hypoglycaemic  Laxative  Vitamin CThe bark is astringent, it is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and as a vaginal injection for leucorrhoea etc[4]. The fruit is antiscorbutic and astringent[4, 7]. It is normally used as a jam or an infusion to treat diarrhoea and haemorrhoids[254]. An infusion can also be used as a gargle for sore throats and as a wash to treat haemorrhoids and excessive vaginal discharge[254]. The seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides which, in reaction with water, produce the extremely toxic prussic acid[254]. In small quantities this acts as a stimulant to the respiratory system but in larger doses can cause respiratory failure and death[K]. It is therefore best to remove the seeds when using the fruit medicinally or as a food[254]. Both the flowers and the fruit are aperient, mildly diuretic, laxative and emmenagogue[9, 13, 21]. An infusion is used in the treatment of painful menstruation, constipation and kidney disorders[9].","Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","An oil is obtained from the seed[13]. A cosmetic face-mask is made from the fruits and is used to combat wrinkled skin[7]. A black dye is obtained from the young branches[74]. All parts of the plant contain tannin and can be used as a black dye[4]. Trees are very wind resistant and can be used in shelterbelt plantings[11, 200].  - hard, fine grained, compact and elastic. It is highly recommended by wood turners and is also used to make hoops for barrels, cogs and furniture[7, 13, 61, 74, 113].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Succeeds in most reasonably good soils in an open sunny position[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates some shade[186], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. Prefers a cool moist position and a lighter neutral to slightly acid soil[11, 13, 200]. Dislikes shallow soils or drought[11, 200]. Succeeds on chalk or acid peats[98, 186]. A very wind firm tree tolerating very exposed and maritime positions[186, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Some named varieties have been developed for their improved fruits which are larger and sweeter than the type[183]. Plants, and especially young seedlings, are quite fast growing[186]. The fruit is very attractive to birds. 28 species of insects are associated with this tree[186]. Responds well to coppicing[186]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
