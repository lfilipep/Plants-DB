See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",H. banksii. F.Muell.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Hedge;,,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The plant makes a good screen or hedge[157]. It is unlikely to be of any use for this purpose in Britain due to its tenderness[K].  - hard, bright yellow. Used for turnery[154].",,"Succeeds in a sunny position in most soils[182]. Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained but moisture-retentive soil in a sunny sheltered position[200]. Plants are frost-tender and so cannot be grown outdoors in Britain[1]. They tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. An alpine form of this species does exist and this should be hardier than the type[157]. The very closely related H. angustifolia. DC., which is considered by some botanists to be no more than a variety of this species, is quite hardy at Kew and is said to tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. Even if the two plants are separate species, then H. angustifolia is likely to have the same uses as this plant[K].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter or early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 4 - 5cm with a heel, July/August in a headily shaded frame. Pot up in spring. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature side-shoots, 4 - 5cm with a heel, October/November in a cold frame. Lift in the following April. High percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
