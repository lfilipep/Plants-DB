A decoction is used in the treatment of beriberi, constipation, jaundice, dropsy, restlessness due to heat, leucorrhoea and croton bean poisoning[147, 218]. The leaves are diuretic[218].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.","A fibre is obtained from the leaf stems[1, 11, 61]. Used for cloth, sails etc[46, 134]. The fibre can also be used for making paper[189] The leaves are harvested in summer and are soaked in water for 24 hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then beaten in a ball mill for 4½ hours before being made into paper[189].","Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems.

The large leaves are very easily torn by the wind[233]. This species is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain and even there will require protection in colder winters[1]. It thrives and fruits in south-western Britain[11, 59] where it survived the very severe winters of 1985 to 1987[K]. Plants are herbaceous and die down after flowering, forming new shoots from the roots. Cultivated in Japan as a fibre plant[11].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse[134]. The seed usually germinates rapidly. Pre-soak stored seed for 72 hours in warm water, if it is still floating then it is not viable. Sow in a warm greenhouse in spring, planting one large seed in each pot. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 24 weeks at 22°c[134]. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for at least 3 years before trying them outdoors. The seed remains viable for 2 years[134].
