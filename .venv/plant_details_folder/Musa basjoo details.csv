23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre is obtained from the leaf stems[1, 11, 61]. Used for cloth, sails etc[46, 134]. The fibre can also be used for making paper[189] The leaves are harvested in summer and are soaked in water for 24 hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then beaten in a ball mill for 4½ hours before being made into paper[189].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Managed Multistem  Regional CropRequires a rich soil and a sunny sheltered position[11, 166, 200]. The large leaves are very easily torn by the wind[233]. This species is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain and even there will require protection in colder winters[1]. It thrives and fruits in south-western Britain[11, 59] where it survived the very severe winters of 1985 to 1987[K]. Plants are herbaceous and die down after flowering, forming new shoots from the roots. Cultivated in Japan as a fibre plant[11].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse[134]. The seed usually germinates rapidly. Pre-soak stored seed for 72 hours in warm water, if it is still floating then it is not viable. Sow in a warm greenhouse in spring, planting one large seed in each pot. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 24 weeks at 22°c[134]. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for at least 3 years before trying them outdoors. The seed remains viable for 2 years[134]. Removal of suckers as the plant comes into growth in spring.",
