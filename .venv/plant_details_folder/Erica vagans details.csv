A good ground cover plant, though it might need weeding for the first year[197]. It can be clipped in spring to give denser growth[197, 208]. Space the plants about 60cm apart each way[208].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A calcifuge plant, it requires a light lime-free loam[11]. Grows well on sunny slopes, thriving in any soil that is not heavy or alkaline[11]. Plants can succeed in a slightly alkaline soil if it is rich in humus according to some reports[182, 188]. Grows best in a poor soil[11]. Resents dry soils. Prefers an open situation. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[182]. A food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies and moths as well as providing a food source for the moths and butterflies[30]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in an acid sandy compost in a cold frame in spring. Keep moist. Prick out the plants as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them in their permanent positions when they are 5 - 8cm tall[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 3cm long taken from twiggy lateral growths near the base of the plant, July/August in a frame. Remove the leaves from the bottom part of the stem without causing any damage to the bark. The cuttings root in a few weeks if they are given some bottom heat. Plant out in spring[11]. Layering in spring or autumn. Plants can be 'dropped' and then dug up and divided about 6 - 12 months later. Dropping involves digging up the plant and then replanting it about 15 - 20cm deeper in the soil to encourage roots to form along the stems[78].",
