Germany and Poland.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EricaTetralix.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EricaTetralix2.gif",,"Erica tetralix is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to October, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Ground Cover; Bog Garden;,,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Wild Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.","Stems are used for making brooms, brushes etc[109]. A yellow dye is obtained from the plant[46, 61]. Plants can be grown as a ground cover[208]. They should be clipped in the spring in order to encourage denser growth[208].",,"Requires a light lime-free loam[1]. A calcifuge plant, requiring a pH below 6[186]. Grows best in a poor soil[11]. Resents dry soils[1], doing well in boggy areas[186]. Prefers an open situation[1]. A good bee plant[108]. There are many named forms, selected for their ornamental value[188]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - surface sow in a sandy compost in a cold frame in spring. Keep moist. Prick out the plants as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them in their permanent positions when they are 5 - 8cm tall[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 3cm long taken from twiggy lateral growths near the base of the plant, July/August in a frame. Remove the leaves from the bottom part of the stem without causing any damage to the bark. The cuttings root in a few weeks if they are given some bottom heat. Plant out in spring[11]. Layering in spring or autumn. Plants can be 'dropped' and then dug up and divided about 6 - 12 months later. Dropping involves digging up the plant and then replanting it about 15 - 20cm deeper in the soil to encourage roots to form along the stems[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
