See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",R. cissoides pauperatus.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,it - raw or cooked[173].

When grown in a sunny position this plant does not flower or fruit, it also produces skeletonized leaves in such a position and looks very different from the woodland form[11]. A large climbing plant in its native range but it is not very hardy in Britain, succeeding outdoors only in the mildest areas of the country where it makes a small shrub[182]. Even there it is best grown against a sunny wall[219]. A plant is growing outdoors in a sheltered position in light woodland at Cambridge Botanical Gardens, it has survived at least one cold winter outdoors there[K]. This species is closely related to R. cissoides[219]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed is required. Fruit is seldom formed in Britain[219]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
