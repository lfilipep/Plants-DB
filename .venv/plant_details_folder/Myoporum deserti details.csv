24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. The plant withstands temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer wetter and colder winters. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in most soils[167]. Succeeds in dry soils[200].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn. Good percentage[78].",
