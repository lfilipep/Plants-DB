24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. Plants are quite tolerant of shade though do not fruit so well in such a position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. A parent of the cultivated American gooseberry, it is occasionally cultivated in America for its edible fruit[46, 61]. It does not tend to fruit very heavily in Britain[K]. The ssp. R. cynosbati inerme. Rehd. has a fruit that is without bristles[200]. Plants can harbour a stage of white pine blister rust, so should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 4 - 5 months cold stratification at between -2 to +2°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200]."
