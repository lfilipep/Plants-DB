17,Edible Uses Description,None known
18,Medicinal Uses,"Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  PoulticeA decoction of the bark is used to treat stomach-ache[303 ]. A poultice of the leaves is used to treat fevers and wounds[303 ].
20,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree has been used in replanting schemes to reclaim imperata grasslands in Asia[303 ]. It is one of the recommended trees in its native range for planting as a shade tree[303 ]. Other Uses The yellow-brown to dark-brown wood is fine-grained, heavy, very hard and durable[46 , 303 , 652 ]. The timber, though not commercially important due to its small dimensions, is favoured locally for construction, household goods, tool handles, boats and implements[46 , 303 ]. The wood produces a high quality charcoal that is compatible and competitive with mangrove charcoal in international markets[303 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Vitex pinnata is common in comparatively dry regions in lowland forest, where it can be found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It is found in areas where the mean annual rainfall is within the range 590 - 1,500mm, and the mean annual temperature 20 - 32°c[303 ]. Young trees grow moderately slowly, with a mean annual diameter increment of 0.6 cm and slightly over 1 cm in Myanmar and Java respectively. One year-old seedlings may reach 2 metres in height, mean annual height increment for the first 15 years after planting is about 1 metre[303 ]. Planted trees start to flower after 11 - 12 years in Java[303 ]. Planting should be done early in the rainy season. Generally at m x 3 metres , occasionally at 1 x 1 - 2 metres on very fertile soils[303 ]. For charcoal production, stands planted at densities of 2,500 trees/ha have yielded 16 - 18 tonnes of charcoal in 4 years[303 ]. Moderately fire resistant[303 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soaking the seeds for 15 seconds in hot water stimulates and increases germination[303 ]. Seeds start to germinate 10 - 40 days after sowing with a germination rate of 60 - 80%[303 ]. Seed can be stored for 1 year after depulping[303 ]. Under dense forest canopy germination is completely inhibited, but the seeds remain dormant and viable for more than 6 months. Seed under light shade differentiates into 2 fractions: one with seeds germinating within 2 months, the other with seeds remaining dormant and only germinating when exposed to full sunlight[303 ]."
