The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",T. involucratum. Ortega. T. wormskioldii. Lehm.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - raw or cooked[61, 105, 118, 257]. The root was a very important food crop for several native North American Indian tribes, who semi-cultivated the plant to ensure good yields every year[256]. The roots can be harvested at any time of the year and were normally dried before being cooked, though they were also occasionally eaten raw[256]. The dried root will store for a considerable period of time if it is kept in a cool place[256]. The Indians considered the long horizontal rhizomes to be superior to the shorter taproots, and also considered that the best roots grew in soft sandy soils[256]. An important vegetable[177]. This report refers to T. wormskioldiana and gives no more details. It probably means the root. Leaves and flowers - raw[257]. Usually eaten raw with salt[257]. The wilted dry leaves have been soaked and stirred in cold water to make a sour drink[257].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,Dynamic accumulator.,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. It is likely to be resistant to maritime exposure. There is some uncertainty over the correct name for this species. T. wormskioldii, which is listed above as a synonym for this species might actually be the correct name for the species or it might be a separate closely related species[204]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in a moist, well-drained circum-neutral soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds in poor soils. It grows well in an apple orchard, the trees will produce tastier fruit that stores better[201]. It should not be grown with camellias or gooseberries because it harbours a mite that can cause fruit drop in the gooseberries and premature budding in the camellias[201]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Buttercups growing nearby depress the growth of the nitrogen bacteria by means of a root exudate[201].","Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in situ. If the seed is in short supply it might be better to sow it in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts.
