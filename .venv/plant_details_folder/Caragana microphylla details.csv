Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously.

The dormant plant can tolerate temperatures down to at least -30°c, but in more maritime climates it is often tempted to come into growth early and this new growth can easily be damaged by late spring frosts[200 ]. Prefers full sun and a light sandy dry or well-drained soil[1 , 11 , 200 ]. Dislikes damp conditions[1 ]. Does not require a rich soil, succeeding on marginal land[11 ]. Caragana microphylla is a polymorphic species and in some cases with transitional forms[266 ]. Hybrids between this species and Caragana korshinskii may occur where these species are sympatric[266 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. Climate: boreal to warm temperate. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard, coppice.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200 ]. It usually germinates in 2 weeks[K ]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water then sown in a cold frame[78 , 113 , 200 ]. If the seed has not swollen then scarify it and re-soak for another 12 hours before sowing[138 ]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c[138 ]. Good percentage[11 ]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, mid summer in a frame[113 ].
