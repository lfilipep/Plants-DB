24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A tree of the hot, wet, tropical lowlands, it requires a year-round moist and warm climate[335 , 377 ]. Plants are intolerant of frost[335 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in dappled shade[420 ]. Grows well in wet soils[377 ]. Prefers an acid soil[335 ]. Seedling trees take up to 8 years before they start to fruit, and some are very shy fruiters[296 ]. It is therefore best to propagate vegetatively from good fruiting forms[296 ]. Grafted plants can fruit in 3 - 4 years[335 ]. Good forms can fruit twice a year[296 ]. Mature trees may produce anywhere from 100 - 1,000 fruits a year[377 ]. A large tree, it is best kept pruned to about 4 metres tall in order to make fruit harvest easier[296 ]. There are some named varieties[301 ]. The quality of the fruits is much higher in recent selected strains[317 ]. Some forms are self-fertile, though others need cross-pollination[335 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - remove it from its husk before sowing[200 ]. Best sown as soon as it is ripe[420 ]. Sow in a nursery seedbed in semi-shade. When sown fresh, the seed usually germinates in 4 - 6 weeks, with a reasonable percentage germinating[377 , 420 ]. Side-grafting. Air-layering may be possible[200 ].",
