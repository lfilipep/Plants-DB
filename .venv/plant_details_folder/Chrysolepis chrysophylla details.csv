A very ornamental tree[183], it is slow to moderate growing and can live 400 - 500 years in the wild[229]. One report says that this species only succeeds in Oceanic and Mediterranean climates[200]. This species has a very wide natural range in N. America, seeds should be tried from various provenances to find more suitable selections for Britain[11]. Another report says that the plant is only found in a small area of California and Oregon, but that it grows on a wide range of soil types[229]. There are trees 16 metres tall in Surrey and Buckinghamshire[11], it also fruits in Cornwall[59] and fruits well in addition to self-sowing at Edinburgh botanical gardens[11]. Flowers are produced on the current years growth, the seed taking two summers to mature[229]. The catkins have an unpleasant hawthorn-like smell to attract midges for their pollination[245]. This species resists chestnut blight[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe, the seed must be protected from mice etc[200]. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out. If stored overwinter it should be kept cool and moist. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors.",
