21,Other Uses Description,"Logs of wood can be beaten with mauls to separate the growth layers, these layers can then be cut into strips and woven into baskets[257]. A blue dye can be obtained from the bark[257].  - not strong, rather soft, durable, heavy, tough, coarse-grained, easily separated into thin layers. It weighs 39lb per cubic foot. Largely used for making furniture, cabinet making, interior finish and veneer[46, 61, 82, 171, 229, 235]. The wood makes a good fuel, it does not crackle or shoot sparks like many other woods[257]. If the wood is soaked in water and then pounded, it separates easily into thin sheets[226]. These sheets have then been used to make woven baskets, barrel hoops, chair seats etc[226].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. A plant of swamps in the wild, in Britain this species requires a moist to wet soil[200]. It succeeds when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. A moderate to slow-growing tree in the wild[229], it is not a great success in Britain, where it is often damaged by late frosts[11]. This species is closely related to F. mandschurica[200]. Trees can bear hermaphrodite flowers, separate male and female flowers, or flowers of one sex only[229]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds.",
