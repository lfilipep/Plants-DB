0,Fraxinus nigra,Black Ash,Oleaceae,2-5,None known,"Deep cold swamps, river banks and shores, tolerating some standing water[43, 82, 229].","North-eastern N. America - Newfoundland to Manitoba, south to Virginia and Iowa.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/FraxinusNigra.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/FraxinusNigra2.gif","Bloom Color: Green. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring.Form: Oval, Rounded.","Fraxinus nigra is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft 0in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",F. sambucifolia.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Bog Garden;,None known,"Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Laxative  Ophthalmic  TonicThe leaves are diaphoretic, diuretic, laxative[4]. They should be gathered in June, well dried and stored in airtight containers[4]. The inner bark has been used as a tonic for the liver and stomach, to check vaginal discharge and to treat painful urination[257]. An infusion of the inner bark has been used as an eye wash for sore eyes[257].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Logs of wood can be beaten with mauls to separate the growth layers, these layers can then be cut into strips and woven into baskets[257]. A blue dye can be obtained from the bark[257].  - not strong, rather soft, durable, heavy, tough, coarse-grained, easily separated into thin layers. It weighs 39lb per cubic foot. Largely used for making furniture, cabinet making, interior finish and veneer[46, 61, 82, 171, 229, 235]. The wood makes a good fuel, it does not crackle or shoot sparks like many other woods[257]. If the wood is soaked in water and then pounded, it separates easily into thin sheets[226]. These sheets have then been used to make woven baskets, barrel hoops, chair seats etc[226].",,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. A plant of swamps in the wild, in Britain this species requires a moist to wet soil[200]. It succeeds when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. A moderate to slow-growing tree in the wild[229], it is not a great success in Britain, where it is often damaged by late frosts[11]. This species is closely related to F. mandschurica[200]. Trees can bear hermaphrodite flowers, separate male and female flowers, or flowers of one sex only[229]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
