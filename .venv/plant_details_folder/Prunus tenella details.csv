0,Prunus tenella,Dwarf Russian Almond,Rosaceae,Coming soon,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Dry grassland[50]. Grasslands, valleys, hollows and dry slopes at elevations up to 1200 metres in Tibet[266].",C. and S.E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil.",P. nana. non DuRoi. = Amygdalus (Prunus) besseriana (Cornucopia) check with entry on P. besseriana.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","it - raw or cooked. The fruit is quite variable in quality, the best forms are somewhat mealy with a fairly nice flavour[K]. The fruit is about 25mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity. Oil from the seed is used as an almond flavouring, it is inferior to the bitter almond oil obtained from P. dulcis[46].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.",Used as a frost-resistant rootstock for P. dulcis[183]. Plants make a fairly good ground cover when spaced about 1 metre apart each way[208]. A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -25°c. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. This plant is a free-growing suckering shrub[182]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113].
