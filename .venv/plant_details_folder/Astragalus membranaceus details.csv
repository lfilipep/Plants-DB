0,Astragalus membranaceus,Huang Qi,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,5-9,Many members of this genus contain toxic glycosides[65]. All species with edible seedpods can be distinguished by their fleshy round or oval seedpod that looks somewhat like a greengage[85]. A number of species can also accumulate toxic levels of selenium when grown in soils that are relatively rich in that element[65]. Toxic doses may result in neuroligical dysfunction leading to paralysis [301]. Should be used cautiously in immunosuppressed patients [301].,"Dry sandy soils[238]. Mountain thickets[279].

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil.",Astragalus propinquus,Cultivated Beds;,None known,"Adaptogen: Helps the body ,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Adaptogen  Antibacterial  Cancer  Cardiotonic  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Hypoglycaemic  Hypotensive  Pectoral  Tonic  Uterine tonic  VasodilatorHuang Qi is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218]. The root is a sweet tonic herb that stimulates the immune system and many organs of the body, whilst lowering blood pressure and blood sugar levels[238]. It is particularly suited to young, physically active people, increasing stamina and endurance and improving resistance to the cold - indeed for younger people it is perhaps superior to ginseng in this respect[254]. Huang Qi is used especially for treatment of the kidneys and also to avoid senility[218]. The plant is often used in conjunction with other herbs such as Atractylodes macrocephala and Ledebouriella seseloides[238]. The root contains a number of bio-active constituents including saponins and isoflavonoids[279]. It is adaptogen, antipyretic, diuretic, tonic, uterine stimulant and vasodilator[218, 254, 279]. It is used in the treatment of cancer, prolapse of the uterus or anus, abscesses and chronic ulcers, chronic nephritis with oedema and proteinuria[176, 218]. Recent research in the West has shown that the root can increase the production of interferon and macrophages and thus help restore normal immune function in cancer patients[254, 279]. Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy recover faster and live longer if given Huang Qi concurrently[254]. The root of 4 year old plants is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238, 254]. The plant is antipyretic, diuretic, pectoral and tonic[218]. Extracts of the plant are bactericidal, hypoglycaemic and hypotensive[218]. Cardiotonic, vasodilator[176].HIV Infections [301].",,Nitrogen Fixer. Provides shelter for beneficial invertebrates: insects and other arthropods. A general nectary plant [1-2].,,"Requires a dry well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. Prefers a sandy slightly alkaline soil[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238]. There is some disagreement over the correct name for this species, with several authorities seeing it as part of A. penduliflorus[261]. The Flora of China treats it as a sub-species of A. mongholicus, as A. mongholicus dahurica[266]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and are best planted in their final positions whilst still small[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Many members of this genus can be difficult to grow, this may be due partly to a lack of their specific bacterial associations in the soil[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate[200]. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed[134, 200]. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours[134, 200]. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh[134]. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
