Mature fruits are usually harvested by hand with the help of a curved knife attached to the end of long bamboo pole[ 303 ]. Getting at the heavy fruit at the end of slender twigs is hazardous[ 303 ]. The delicate fruit really should be caught to break the fall, it has a very short shelf life[ 303 ]. A tree produces about 180 fruit per season.","Seed - it has a short viability and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe[ 200 , 303 ]. The seed germinates best at a temperature of 24 - 27c[ 200 ].
