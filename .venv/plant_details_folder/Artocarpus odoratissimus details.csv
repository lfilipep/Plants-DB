24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of lowland humid tropics, succeeding at elevations up to 1,000 metres[ 200 , 303 ], it grows best in regions with abundant and equally distributed rainfall[ 306 , 525 ]. Prefers a deep, well-drained soil[ 200 ]. Young plants need some shade, but need increasing light levels as they mature[ 200 ]. Trees as young as 4 - 6 years can begin to bear fruit[ 303 ]. Yields of 4 - 6 tonnes per hectare have been achieved[ 303 ]. The fruits are borne at the end of long flexible branches and ripe fruits are heavy, fragile and difficult to reach for harvest[ 303 ]. Mature fruits are usually harvested by hand with the help of a curved knife attached to the end of long bamboo pole[ 303 ]. Getting at the heavy fruit at the end of slender twigs is hazardous[ 303 ]. The delicate fruit really should be caught to break the fall, it has a very short shelf life[ 303 ]. A tree produces about 180 fruit per season."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a short viability and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe[ 200 , 303 ]. The seed germinates best at a temperature of 24 - 27c[ 200 ]. Germination is often 100% within 4 weeks[ 303 ]. Plants are spaced 12-14 m apart. Root cuttings. Air layering. Plants can be grafted."
