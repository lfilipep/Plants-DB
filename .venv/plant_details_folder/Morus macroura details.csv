18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Dry and insipid[146]. Sweetish [183] when fully ripe[158, 272]. The yellowish-white fruit is 6 - 12cm long[266].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentThe juice of the bark is applied to cuts and wounds[272].,
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is used for paper making[266]. No further details are given, but it is almost certainly the bark that is used as the source of fibre[K]. A colour is distilled from the wood and leaves[266].  - hard, close grained with a beautiful lustre. Used for furniture, construction etc[146, 272].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 11]. Not very hardy in the colder parts of Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Mulberries have brittle roots and so need to be handled with care when planting them out[238]. Any pruning should only be carried out in the winter when the plant is fully dormant because mulberries bleed badly when cut[238]. Ideally prune only badly placed branches and dead wood[238]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed germinates best if given 2 - 3 months cold stratification[80, 98]. Sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if possible, otherwise in February in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in the first spring, though it sometimes takes another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. A good percentage take, though they sometimes fail to thrive[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 25 - 30cm with a heel of 2 year old wood, autumn or early spring in a cold frame or a shady bed outside[78, 113, 200]. Bury the cuttings to threequarters of their depth. Layering in autumn[200].",
