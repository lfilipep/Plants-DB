24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in this country. It tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a light well-drained moderately fertile humus-rich soil in a sunny sheltered position[200].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 8 - 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division."
