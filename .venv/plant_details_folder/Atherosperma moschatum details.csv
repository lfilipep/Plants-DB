Plants are not very hardy in Britain, requiring greenhouse treatment in most areas, but they succeed outdoors in a woodland garden in the milder areas of the country[166]. Another report says that plants are fairly hardy when grown in a sheltered position[11]. A tree at Edinburgh Botanical Gardens is 3 metres tall and flowers annually, whilst there are trees 6 metres tall in Cornwall[11]. Plants can tolerate short-lived frosts to about -5°c if they are well sited and sheltered from cold drying winds[200]. Plants come into flower when they are quite young. All parts of the plant are aromatic[184, 245]. The flowers diffuse a sweet perfume whilst the nuts have a musk-like fragrance similar to nutmegs[245].

When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.
