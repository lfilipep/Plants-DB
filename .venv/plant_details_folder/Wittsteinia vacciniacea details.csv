One report says that it requires greenhouse protection in this country[1]. However, plants tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and colder wetter and longer winters. It would certainly be worthwhile trying it outdoors in the milder areas of the country[K]. It is likely to require a sunny sheltered position.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters before trying them outdoors. Cuttings. Probably it is best to take these in July or August in a frame.
