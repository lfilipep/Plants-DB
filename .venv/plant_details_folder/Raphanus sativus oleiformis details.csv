A somewhat hot taste, and the texture is somewhat coarse[K]. As long as they are young, they make an acceptable addition in small quantities to chopped salads and are a reasonable cooked green[K]. A nutritional analysis is available[218]. Young flower clusters - raw or cooked[183]. A spicy flavour with a crisp pleasant texture, they make a nice addition to salads or can be used as a broccoli substitute[9, K]. Seeds - raw. The seed can be soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then allowed to sprout for about 6 days[244]. They have a hot spicy flavour and go well in salads[183, 244]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[2, 183]. Young seedpods - raw[2, 37, 52, 104]. Crisp and juicy with a mildly hot flavour[K]. They must be eaten when young because they quickly become tough and fibrous[183].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi.

The roots stimulate the appetite and digestion, having a tonic and laxative effect upon the intestines and indirectly stimulating the flow of bile[254]. Consuming radish generally results in improved digestion, but some people are sensitive to its acridity and robust action[254]. The plant is used in the treatment of intestinal parasites, though the part of the plant used is not specified[147]. The leaves, seeds and old roots are used in the treatment of asthma and other chest complaints[218]. The juice of the fresh leaves is diuretic and laxative[240]. The seed is carminative, diuretic, expectorant, laxative and stomachic[176, 218, 240]. It is taken internally in the treatment of indigestion, abdominal bloating, wind, acid regurgitation, diarrhoea and bronchitis[238]. The root is antiscorbutic, antispasmodic, astringent, cholagogue, digestive and diuretic[21, 218]. It is crushed and used as a poultice for burns, bruises and smelly feet[218]. Radishes are also an excellent food remedy for stone, gravel and scorbutic conditions[4]. The root is best harvested before the plant flowers[21]. Its use is not recommended if the stomach or intestines are inflamed[21]. The plant contains raphanin, which is antibacterial and antifungal[218, 238]. It inhibits the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, streptococci, Pneumococci etc[176]. The plant also shows anti-tumour activity[218].","Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The growing plant repels beetles from tomatoes and cucumbers[20, 201]. It is also useful for repelling various other insect pests such as carrot root fly[201]. There is a fodder variety that grows more vigorously and is used as a green manure[87].",,"Prefers a rich soil with ample moisture[16, 52]. Dislikes very heavy or acid soils[16, 37]. Plants are susceptible to drought and require irrigation during dry spells in the summer or the root quality will rapidly deteriorate and the plant will go to seed. Fodder radishes are grown mainly for their leaves and oil-rich seeds, they are used as a green manure or stock feed though they can also be eaten by people. The roots of these plants soon become fibrous, though they make acceptable eating when young. Radishes are a good companion plant for lettuces, nasturtiums, peas and chervil, tomatoes and cucumbers[18, 20]. They are said to repel cucumber beetles if planted near cucumber plants and they also repel the vine borers which attack squashes, marrows and courgettes[238]. They grow badly with hyssop[18, 20] and with grape vines[201].",Seed - sow spring in situ.
