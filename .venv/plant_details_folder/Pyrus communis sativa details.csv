13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pyrus communis sativa is a deciduous Tree growing to 5 m (16ft 5in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. The flavour ranges from rather harsh and astringent (cultivars used for making alcoholic drinks) through to soft, sweet and very juicy. The best dessert fruits have an exquisite sweet flavour, usually with a very soft flesh, whilst cooking varieties have harder less sweet flesh[K]."

22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow-tan dye is obtained from the leaves[106, 115].  - heavy, tough, durable, fine grained, hard. Used by cabinet and instrument makers[11, 61, 100, 149]. When covered with black varnish it is an excellent ebony substitute[74]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained loam in full sun[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[200]. Tolerates light shade but does not fruit so well in such a position. Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile, though plants can become chlorotic on very alkaline soils[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Very hardy, tolerating temperatures down to below -15°c[200]. Widely cultivated for its edible fruit in temperate areas, there are many named varieties that can provide fruit from late July to April or May of the following year. This is the collective name for all the pear cultivars that have been derived from P. communis, probably through hybridization with P. cordata and P. nivalis. Where space is at a premium, or at the limits of their climatic range, pears can be grown against a wall. Most cultivars will grow well against a sunny south or west facing wall but, because of their relatively early flowering, they are not really suitable for north or east facing walls[219]. Most cultivars are not self-fertile and a number of cultivars have incompatible pollen, so care must be taken to ensure the provision of a suitable pollen partner[200]. Trees grow less well in grass, root secretions from the grass inhibiting the root growth of the pear[201]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. The seed of pear cultivars will not usually breed true to type."
