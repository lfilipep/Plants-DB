See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to June. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",C. lambertiana.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Hedge;,None known,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It can be trimmed so long as it is not cut back into old wood.  - heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and very durable[82]. Used for general construction[50, 61].",,"Thrives in a well-drained loamy or peaty soil[11]. Very tolerant of hot dry conditions[81]. Tolerates poor sandy soils[81] but is then more subject to insect damage in a succession of dry seasons[11]. Requires a sunny position[81]. Plants are not happy when growing on chalk, but they thrive on limestone[200]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure[11, 75, 82] but plants are not very wind firm in shallow soils[166]. Young trees require staking when planted in very exposed positions[75]. This species is somewhat tender in Britain, especially when young and at least in the north of the country Established trees, however, will tolerate occasional temperatures down to about -10°c and are hardy in most British winters[11, 81, 260]. A tree is 25 metres tall at Kew (1988) but in general they grow better in the western maritime zone[11]. The variety 'Lutea' is hardier than the type and is also more tolerant of wind and salt spray as well as of trimming[185]. New growth takes place from May to September and can be very vigorous when young with new shoots 1 metre long and increases in girth of 5cm or more a year even in old trees[185]. Trees in a very exposed maritime position at Rosewarne in N. Cornwall were 12 metres tall after 30 years[75]. Resents root disturbance, it is best planted out when the roots are in active growth in early autumn or spring[81]. Often planted for shelter and ornament, and also occasionally for timber in W. and S. Europe[50]. The cones ripen in their second year[82]. They can remain closed on the tree for a number of years, opening after the heat of a forest fire to scatter their seeds which then germinate and grow quickly in the ashes of the fire[200]. The crushed leaves have a strong scent of lemon verbena[185]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Three weeks cold stratification can improve germination rates[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c. The seedlings are very subject to damping off so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can store for several years[113]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, September in a frost-proof frame[1]. April/May is the best time to take cuttings[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
