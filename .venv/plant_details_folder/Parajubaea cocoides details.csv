0,Parajubaea cocoides,Quito Palm,Arecaceae or Palmae,Coming soon,None known,Found at altitudes from 2000 to 3000 metres[196].,"S. America - Ecuador, Colombia.",(1 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ParajubaeaCocoides.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ParajubaeaCocoides2.jpg",,"Parajubaea cocoides is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a medium rate.  It is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[196]. A sweet taste, it is a very popular food with children[196]. The seed is about 2cm long[200]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[196].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",None known,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Oil  Staple Crop: SugarRequires a sunny sheltered position in a well-drained soil but with plenty of water in the growing season[196]. Plants probably require a cool summer and quickly lose vigour in areas where night temperatures do not fall below 13°c[196]. Plants experience sub-zero temperatures in their native range and it should therefore be possible to grow them in warm temperate zones that only experience occasional light frosts[200]. They will possibly succeed in the milder areas of Cornwall[231]. This species has a deep penetrating root systems and generally establishes best when planted out at a young stage. It is not suitable for container cultivation[231]. Older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231], so if the plants can be protected from frosts in their earlier years it might be possible to grow them in areas at the limit of their cold tolerance. Plants are relatively fast-growing for a palm and can produce fruit in 4 years from seed[196]. Trees are deep rooted[196].","Seed - sow in a warm greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. It usually germinates freely. Stored seed is more difficult to germinate, it should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water before sowing in a warm greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give them some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
