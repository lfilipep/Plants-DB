See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",L. catesbaei.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Intensive Silvopasture: Combines improved pasture with high-density woody nitrogen-fixing legumes.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

Plants are not very successful in Britain[11]. One report says they are not very hardy in Britain, succeeding outdoors only in the milder areas of the country, whilst another says that they are hardy to zone 6, which means tolerating temperatures down to -15° or lower[200]. The flowers are strongly fragrant[245]. This species is often confused with L. fontanesiana[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow late winter in a shady part of the greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination is variable. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, August in a frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn. Takes 12 months. Very high percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
