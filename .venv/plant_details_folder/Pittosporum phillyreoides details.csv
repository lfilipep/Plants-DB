0,Pittosporum phillyreoides,"Weeping Pittosporum, Narrow-leaf Pittosporum",Pittosporaceae,9-11,"This plant contains saponins[152, 154]. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans, and although they are fairly toxic to people they are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down if the food is thoroughly cooked for a long time. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",Dry land away from the coast[152]. Often in extremely dry areas[167].,"Australia - New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria.",(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PittosporumPhillyreoides.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PittosporumPhillyreoides2.jpg","Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Vase, Weeping.","Pittosporum phillyreoides is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4.5 m (14ft 9in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",P. angustifolium.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"Seed - dried and ground into a powder[61, 105, 173]. Very bitter[46, 144, 193]. A good edible gum is obtained from this plant[144, 173].

Requires a sunny position[200]. Plants tolerate much wetter conditions in cultivation than they experience in their native habitat[167]. Not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. Plants succeed outdoors in Cornwall though they need greenhouse protection in other parts of the country[1]. A slow growing plant[167]. Very amenable to pruning, plants can be cut right back into old wood if required[200]. The species in this genus are very likely to hybridize with other members of the genus[200]. When growing a species from seed it is important to ensure that the seed either comes from a known wild source, or from isolated specimens in cultivation. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow when ripe in the autumn or in late winter in a warm greenhouse[78, 200]. The seed usually germinates freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, move the plants to a cold frame as soon as they are established and plant out late in the following spring[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold during their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Poor to fair percentage[78]. Basal ripewood cuttings late autumn in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
