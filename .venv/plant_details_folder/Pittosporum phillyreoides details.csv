2,Family,Pittosporaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,9-11,
4,Known Hazards,"This plant contains saponins[152, 154]. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans, and although they are fairly toxic to people they are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down if the food is thoroughly cooked for a long time. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Screen, Standard, Seashore, Specimen, Street treeRequires a well-drained light loamy soil, succeeding in very dry soils[11, 167]. Requires a sunny position[200]. Plants tolerate much wetter conditions in cultivation than they experience in their native habitat[167]. Not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. Plants succeed outdoors in Cornwall though they need greenhouse protection in other parts of the country[1]. A slow growing plant[167]. Very amenable to pruning, plants can be cut right back into old wood if required[200]. The species in this genus are very likely to hybridize with other members of the genus[200]. When growing a species from seed it is important to ensure that the seed either comes from a known wild source, or from isolated specimens in cultivation. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow when ripe in the autumn or in late winter in a warm greenhouse[78, 200]. The seed usually germinates freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, move the plants to a cold frame as soon as they are established and plant out late in the following spring[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold during their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Poor to fair percentage[78]. Basal ripewood cuttings late autumn in a cold frame[200].",
