Plants grow and spread freely in any light soil and do well when hanging over a wall[221]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Seed is freely produced in British gardens[221]. Plants are very attractive to slugs[221]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Difficult, because the long runners do not take kindly to separation from the parent plant and are difficult to establish[221].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
