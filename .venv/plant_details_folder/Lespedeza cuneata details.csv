A decoction is used in the treatment of testicular tuberculosis, hernia, enuresis, dental caries, toothache, infantile marasmus/ascariasis, snake and dog bites, skin ulcers, dysentery and enteritis[147]",Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,The plant has an extensive root system and fixes atmospheric nitrogen through bacteria that live on its roots. It is used in soil conservation schemes for renewing worn-out soils[171].,,"Easily grown in a light loam in full sun[1]. The top growth is not very cold tolerant, although the rootstock is considerably hardier. Plants are usually cut back to the ground in all but very mild winters, though they generally resprout well from the base in the following spring and flower in late summer[182]. In addition to the normally pollinated sexual flowers, this species also produces clusters of cleistogamous flowers in the leaf axils[266]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow it in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame. It can be difficult to get the cuttings through their first winter, it is best to plunge the pots in a bed of ashes in a sheltered border outdoors[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
