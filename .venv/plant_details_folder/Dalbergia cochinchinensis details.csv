13,Summary,"Dalbergia cohcinchinensis or commonly known as Thailand Rosewood, Siamese Rosewood, or Tracwood, is a threatened species due to overexploitation for its valuable hardwood. It is a slow-growing, large, evergreen tree with a spherical well-branched canopy. It usually grows up to 30 m in height with trunk diameter of up to 120 cm. It has a nitrogen-fixing capability. Aside from it being resistant to insect attacks, the wood is heavy, very hard, and durable. It is used in making high quality furniture, carvings, handicrafts, musical instruments, and sewing machines. It can also be used for fuel and charcoal making.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Dalbergia cochinchinensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: A nitrogen fixing species, it is suitable for use in agroforestry and for soil improvement[ 337 ]. Other Uses: The heartwood is red or almost black with a fine texture; it is distinctly demarcated from the gray sapwood[ 337 , 404 ]. The texture is uniform and fine. The wood is heavy, very hard and durable, easy to work and resistant to insects[ 337 , 349 , 384 , 404 ]. An attractive wood, the distinctive heartwood makes beautiful patterns when cut, and the cut wood releases a rose-like fragrance[ 337 , 349 , 404 ]. It is used to make high quality furniture, carvings and handicrafts, musical instruments and sewing machines[ 349 , 443 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[ 404 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of tropical lowland forests, where it is found at elevations up to 400 metres. It grows in areas with a uniform rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,650 mm per year, with a mean annual temperature of 20 - 32°c and an absolute minimum temperature of 10°c[ 337 ]. Older plants require a position in full sun, whilst younger plants are shade tolerant. Succeeds in most soil conditions[ 337 ]. Prefers deep sandy clay soils and calcareous soils[ 384 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 337 ]. Plants regenerate well by coppicing[ 384 ]. The bad stem form and a tendency to produce buttresses is a problem and further research on improvement and management is needed[ 337 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 404 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ]. The seeds are orthodox and store well in a dry place[ 337 ]. Air layering. Cuttings Grafting.",
