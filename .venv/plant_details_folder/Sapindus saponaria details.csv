The fruits and the seeds contain up to 30% emulsifying saponins[307 , 348 ]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K ]. (Parts of plant are poisonous if ingested)","Moist or dry thickets and open forest[200 ]. Dry, coastal, limestone thickets[307 ].","S.

It is commonly found in South America, with its crown globose in shape, broad, and dense. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound comprising of 5-17 leaflets that are narrow and up to 18cm long. The flowers are white and fruits are one-seeded berries with yellow pulp and brown seed. The seeds yield oil that has medicinal properties. Moreover, the root and stem barks are astringent, bitter, and tonic while the fruit is diuretic and used against anemia. There is no known edible parts. The orange-brown fruit is used as a soap and hair shampoo. The seeds when crushed are used to make insecticide. Fiber obtained from the inner bark is made into ropes. The seeds are used in bead works, crafts, rosaries, and buttons. The wood is used for construction among others. The plant is highly tolerant of a wide range of soil and environmental conditions and an excellent pioneer species. Other common names include Wild Chinaberry, Florida Soap Berry, Soap Nut, and Soap Tree.","Sapindus saponaria is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid, very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",Cupania saponarioides Sw. Sapindus abruptus Lour. Sapindus divaricatus Cambess.

Plants are very tolerant of a wide range of soils, including those that are dry, stony or nutrient deficient[200 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[307 ]. Tolerant of salt-laden winds[307 ]. Plants have a moderate rate of growth, able to reach a height of around 2.5 metres within 2 years from seed[419 ]. The flowers are mostly male, with some female flowers and also some bisexual. The male flowers are produced in great quantities, they seem to fall from the tree almost like rain and litter the ground beneath[447 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring. Bloom Color: Cream/Tan.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A low to moderate rate of germination can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 40 days[419 ]. When the seedbed-sown seedlings are 4 - 6cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 6 - 7 months later[419 ]. The seed stores well even when kept at ambient temperatures and humidity, still germinating satisfactorily after more than 12 months in storage[419 ].
