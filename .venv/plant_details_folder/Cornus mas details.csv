Form: Rounded.","Cornus mas is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from February to March, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",C. mascula.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,Fruit: ,"Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Oil: ,Oil: ","uit - raw, dried or used in preserves[2, 3, 7, 9, 13, 183]. Juicy, with a nice acid flavour[11]. The fully ripe fruit has a somewhat plum-like flavour and texture and is very nice eating, but the unripe fruit is rather astringent[K]. It is rather low in pectin and so needs to be used with other fruit when making jam[9]. At one time the fruit was kept in brine and used like olives[183]. The fruit is a reasonable size, up to 15mm long, with a single large seed[K]. A small amount of edible oil can be extracted from the seeds[7]. Seeds are roasted, ground into a powder and used as a coffee substitute[183].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Nutritive: A food for convalescents to help restore strength.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cholera  Febrifuge  NutritiveThe bark and the fruit are astringent, febrifuge and nutritive[7]. The astringent fruit is a good treatment for bowel complaints and fevers, whilst it is also used in the treatment of cholera[4, 254]. The flowers are used in the treatment of diarrhoea[4].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","An oil is obtained from the seed[7]. A dye is obtained from the bark[3, 7]. No more details are given. Another report says that a red dye is obtained from the plant, but does not say which part of the plant[4]. The leaves are a good source of tannin[7].  - very hard, it is highly valued by turners[7]. The wood is heavier than water and does not float[7]. It is used for tools, machine parts, etc[7, 11, 13, 61].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Firewood, Pest tolerant, Hedge, Screen, Specimen, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a moist soil[108] and a sunny position[15] but also succeeds in light shade[188]. Plants are fairly wind resistant[K]. Plants grow and crop well in pots. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[184]. At one time the cornelian cherry was frequently cultivated for its edible fruit, though it has fallen into virtual disuse as a fruit crop in most areas[3]. It is still being cultivated in parts of C. Europe and there are some named varieties[183]. 'Macrocarpa' has larger fruits than the type[182]. 'Nana' is a dwarf form, derived from a yellow-fruited clone[182]. 'Variegata' has been seen on a number of occasions with very large crops of fruit, even in years when the type species has not fruited well[K]. 'Jolico' has well-flavoured fruits 3 times larger than the species. There are also a number of cultivars with yellow, white and purplish fruit. Seedlings can take up to 20 years to come into fruit. Plants produced from cuttings come into fruit when much younger, though they do not live as long as the seedlings. A very ornamental plant[1] it flowers quite early in the year and is a valuable early food for bees[13, 108]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame[188]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
