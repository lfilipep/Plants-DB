Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a moist soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Prefers a calcareous soil. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. Grows well in open woodlands[1, 4]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits and deer[233]. This species is no more than part of A. lycoctonum according to some botanists[200]. We are keeping it separate because of the report that, unlike most members of the genus, this species is not poisonous[178]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby species, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[111]. The seed can be stratified and sown in spring but will then be slow to germinate[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division - best done in spring but it can also be done in autumn[1, 111]. Another report says that division is best carried out in the autumn or late winter because the plants come into growth very early in the year[233].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
