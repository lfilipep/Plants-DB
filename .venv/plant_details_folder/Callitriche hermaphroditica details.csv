22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A water plant, it should be allowed to root into the soil at the bottom of the pond or be grown in a pot in the pond[200]. This species is an excellent oxygenator of the water and a good food source for fish[1, 200]. It provides a good habitat for wildlife in the pond, the leaves holding spawn well[1]. This species belongs to one of only two known dicot genera where pollination taks place under water[274]. Plants remain active all winter[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details on this species but would suggest that the seed will be best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in a pot standing in about 5cm of water. It is quite likely that the seed has a short viability, especially if it is allowed to become dry. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in trays of water in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings can be taken at any time in the growing season. They root easily, even if just placed in a pot of water.",
