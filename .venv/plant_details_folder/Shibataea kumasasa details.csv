See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Sasa ruscifolia. Bambusa kumasasa. B. ruscifolia. Phyllostachys kumasasa.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"A useful ground cover for shady places, it is best planted about 60cm apart[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Container, Ground cover, Specimen. Requires a damp shaded site in a humus rich soil[200]. New growth in spring will be badly impaired if the plants are allowed to become dry. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -23°c[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. This species looks very different to most bamboos, in appearance it is more like the butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus). The rootstock is running but not aggressively so in cooler climates, it forms a slowly spreading compact clump in Britain[200]. New shoots are produced from early spring, this growth will be impaired if the plant is allowed to dry out[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage.","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could take 3 years or so. The plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings.
