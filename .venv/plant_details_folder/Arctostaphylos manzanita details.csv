18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 46, 61]. An agreeable acid flavour but the fruit is dry and mealy[95]. Hard to digest, the fruit should be eaten in moderation[95]. It can be dried and ground into a powder[105, 161] and then used as a flavouring in soups, bread etc[213, 257]. A cooling drink can be made from the fruit[161]. The berries can be crushed to make a sweet, unfermented cider[257]. The fruit is white but becomes red-brown.  These are 12 mm across [1-4]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  Astringent  Poultice  StomachicA poultice of the chewed leaves is applied to sores and headaches[257]. The leaves are chewed as a treatment for stomach ache and cramps[257]. An infusion of the leaves is used to treat severe colds and diarrhoea[257]. A cider made from the fruit is used in the treatment of stomach complaints and as an appetizer to create appetite[257].
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute."
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. The leaves can be boiled and the yellowish-red extract used as a cleansing body wash[257]. The wood makes an exceedingly fine fuel[257]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. Prefers a warm sunny position[3, 166]. Tolerates maritime exposure[49, 166, 182]. Plants are not hardy in the colder parts of Britain, they tolerate temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Pollination is often poor in Britain[3]. Another report says that the plant does not fruit in this country[11]. This species is called A. pungens manzanita by some botanists[11]. A specimen seen at Cambridge B.G. was 2.5m tall in 1989[K]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134]. They can tolerate long dry periods [1-4]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. Another report says that the seed requires 60 days warm followed by 60 days cold stratification[160]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. Takes one year[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200]."
