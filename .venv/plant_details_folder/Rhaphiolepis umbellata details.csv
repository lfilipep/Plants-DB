Plants are tolerant of sea spray[245]. Tolerating temperatures down to about -15°c[200], it is normally hardy at Kew[1]. A polymorphic species[58], there are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. The plant bears honey-scented hawthorn-like blossoms[245]. Plants do not require pruning[182]. They are of slow to moderate growth rate[202]. Plants resent root disturbance and so are best grown in pots and then planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a warm greenhouse[78]. Stored seed should be sown in February/March in a warm greenhouse[78]. Germination is variable[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5cm with a heel, September/October in a frame.
