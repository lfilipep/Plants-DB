13,Summary,"Elderberry is native to most of Europe and North America. It has excellent edible, medicinal and other uses. The flavour of the raw fruit is not acceptable to all tastes, though when cooked it makes delicious jams, preserves, pies etc. It can be used fresh or dried, the dried fruit being less bitter. The fruit is used to add flavour and colour to preserves, jams, pies, sauces, chutneys etc., and is used to make wine. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter and is borne in large clusters in late summer to early autumn. Flowers can be eaten raw, cooked or dried for later use. The flowers are crisp and somewhat juicy. They have an aromatic smell and flavour and are delicious raw as a refreshing snack on a summers day, though one must look out for insects. The flowers are used to add a muscatel flavour to stewed fruits, jellies and jams (especially gooseberry jam). They are often used to make a sparkling wine. Sweet tea is made from the dried flowers. The leaves are used to impart a green colouring to oils and fats. Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early summer. Form: Rounded.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiinflammatory  Aperient  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Emollient  Expectorant  Galactogogue  Haemostatic  Laxative  Ophthalmic  Purgative  Salve  StimulantElder has a very long history of household use as a medicinal herb and is also much used by herbalists[4]. The plant has been called 'the medicine chest of country people'[4]. The flowers are the main part used in modern herbalism, though all parts of the plant have been used at times[238]. Stimulant[9, 53, 165]. The inner bark is collected from young trees in the autumn and is best sun-dried[4]. It is diuretic, a strong purgative and in large doses emetic[4, 7]. It is used in the treatment of constipation and arthritic conditions[238]. An emollient ointment is made from the green inner bark[4]. The leaves can be used both fresh or dry. For drying, they are harvested in periods of fine weather during June and July. The leaves are purgative, but are more nauseous than the bark[4]. They are also diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant and haemostatic[4, 7]. The juice is said to be a good treatment for inflamed eyes[4]. An ointment made from the leaves is emollient and is used in the treatment of bruises, sprains, chilblains, wounds etc[4]. The fresh flowers are used in the distillation of 'Elder Flower Water'. The flowers can be preserved with salt to make them available for distillation later in the season[4]. The water is mildly astringent and a gentle stimulant. It is mainly used as a vehicle for eye and skin lotions[4]. The dried flowers are diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, galactogogue and pectoral[4, 7]. An infusion is very effective in the treatment of chest complaints and is also used to bathe inflamed eyes[4]. The infusion is also a very good spring tonic and blood cleanser[4]. Externally, the flowers are used in poultices to ease pain and abate inflammation[4]. Used as an ointment, it treats chilblains, burns, wounds, scalds etc[4]. The fruit is depurative, weakly diaphoretic and gently laxative[4, 7]. A tea made from the dried berries is said to be a good remedy for colic and diarrhoea[4]. The fruit is widely used for making wines, preserves etc., and these are said to retain the medicinal properties of the fruit[4]. The pith of young stems is used in treating burns and scalds[46, 61, 100]. The root is no longer used in herbal medicine but it formerly had a high reputation as an emetic and purgative that was very effective against dropsy[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh inner bark of young branches[4]. It relieves asthmatic symptoms and spurious croup in children[4]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Sambucus nigra for cough and bronchitis, fevers and colds (see [302] for critics of commission E).",

23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is a valuable addition to the compost heap[14, 18], its flowers are an alternative ingredient of 'QR' herbal compost activator[32] and the roots of the plant improve fermentation of the compost heap when growing nearby[18]. The leaves are used as an insect repellent[4, 6, 14, 66], very effective when rubbed on the skin though they do impart their own unique fragrance[K]. They can be powdered and placed amongst plants to act as a deterrent[14], or made into a spray when they act as an insecticide[7]. This is prepared by boiling 3 - 4 handfuls of leaves in a litre of water, then straining and allowing to cool before applying[201]. Effective against many insects, it also treats various fungal infections such as leaf rot and powdery mildew[201].The dried flowering shoots are used to repel insects, rodents etc[101]. The flowers are used in skin lotions, oils and ointments[238]. Tolerant of salt-laden gales, this species can be grown as a shelter hedge in exposed maritime areas[29, 75], it is rather bare in the winter though[K]. This is an excellent pioneer species to use when re-establishing woodlands. It is very tough and wind-resistant, grows quickly and provides shelter for longer-lived and taller woodland species to establish. It will generally maintain itself in the developing woodland, though usually in the sunnier positions[K]. A dye is obtained from the fruit and the bark[13, 15]. The bark of older branches and the root have been used as an ingredient in dyeing black[4]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves when alum is used as a mordant[4]. The berries yield various shades of blue and purple dyes[4]. They have also been used as a hair dye, turning the hair black[4]. The blue colouring matter from the fruit can be used as a litmus to test if something is acid or alkaline. It turns green in an alkaline solution and red in an acid solution[4]. The pith in the stems of young branches pushes out easily and the hollow stems thus made have been used as pipes for blowing air into a fire[4]. They can also be made into musical instruments[4]. The pith of the wood is used for making microscope slides and also for treating burns and scalds[46, 61, 100]. The mature wood is white and fine-grained. It is easily cut and polishes well[4]. Valued highly by carpenters, it has many used, for making skewers, mathematical instruments, toys etc[4, 13, 100, 244]. A good forage for animals: mule deer, elk, sheep and small birds. It is classified as nesting habitat for many birds, including hummingbirds, warblers, and vireos. Elderberries are a favorite food for migrating band-tailed pigeons in northern California.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Dye: Botanical dyes replacing synthetic dyes (known as heavy polluters).,Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",

A very easily grown plant, it tolerates most soils and situations[11, 28, 98], growing well on chalk[28, 98, 186], but prefers a moist loamy soil[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates some shade but fruits better in a sunny position[37, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. Another report says that it is intolerant of very smoky atmospheres[186]. The elder is very occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties though most of these have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. The sub-species S. nigra alba has white/green fruits that are nicer than the type species and are quite nice raw[K]. The elder also has a very long history of folk use, both medicinally and for a wide range of other uses. All in all it is a very valuable plant to have in the garden. The leaves often begin to open as early as January and are fully open in April[186]. The leaves fall in October/November in exposed sites, later in sheltered positions[186]. Young stems can be killed by late frosts but they are soon replaced from the ground level[186]. Very tolerant of pruning, plants can be cut back to ground level and will regrow from the base[186]. The flowers have a sweet, almost overpowering smell, not exactly pleasant when inhaled near to for it has fishy undertones, but from a distance its musky scent is appealing[245]. Very resistant to the predations of rabbits[17, 186]. The flowers are very attractive to insects[186]. The fruit is very attractive to birds[186] and this can draw them away from other cultivated fruits[14, 186]. The elder is an early colonizer of derelict land, the seed arriving in the defecations of birds and mammals[186]. It is a very good pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with a heel, late autumn in a frame or a sheltered outdoor bed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season.",
