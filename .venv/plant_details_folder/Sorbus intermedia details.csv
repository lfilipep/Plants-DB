4,Known Hazards,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."

It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects, Apomictic (reproduce by seeds formed without sexual fusion). The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3]. A mild, though slightly bitter flavour with a mealy texture[K]. The fruit is up to 13mm across[200] and is produced in quite large clusters, making harvesting easier[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Resistant to maritime exposure, this tree can be used as a part of a shelterbelt planting[75, 200]. If regularly trimmed it can be used as a dense deciduous hedge[200]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most reasonably good well-drained soils in an open sunny position[11]. Tolerates very acid or alkaline soils[200] and light shade[188], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. Suitable for very exposed sites, including maritime exposure[75, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[11, 200]. Resistant to fireblight[11]. The trees usually have apomictic flowers. They thus produce seed asexually, each seedling being a clone of the parent[11]. The fruits are very attractive to birds[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring."
