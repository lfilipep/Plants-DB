13,Summary,"Form: Columnar, Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Abies nordmanniana is an evergreen Tree growing to 50 m (164ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Christmas tree, Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Prefers a good moist but not water-logged soil[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very shade tolerant, especially when young, but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200], but it tolerates more alkaline conditions than many other members of the genus[11]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope and in areas with cool wet summers[11]. A very ornamental tree[1], it can hold its leaves for up to 26 years[81]. This species grows well in most parts of Britain but it is very susceptible to damage by aphis in some parts of the country[11]. It grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland and the far west of Britain[11]. Trees grow quickly when young, a 60cm increase within 2 years of planting out is not uncommon[185]. It rarely exceeds this rate as it gets older though[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cultivated for timber in C. Europe[50]. It is also sometimes grown as a 'Christmas tree'[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, There are no flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].",
