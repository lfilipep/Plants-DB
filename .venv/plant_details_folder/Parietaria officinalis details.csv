The pollen of this plant is one of the earliest and most active of the hay fever allergens[7]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame. Prick out the seedling when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed then it can be sown in situ in autumn or spring. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
