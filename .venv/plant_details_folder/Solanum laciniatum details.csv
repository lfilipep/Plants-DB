See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Solanum aviculare var. laciniatum,Hedge; East Wall. By. South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 173]. It must be thoroughly ripe because the unripe fruit is poisonous[2, 46, 153, 154]. It can be used as a sweet fruit or as a vegetable[61]. Best harvested once it has fallen from the plant, the fruit will then have lost its unpleasant acidity[183]. It tastes much worse than it looks, the fruit is sickly sweet and often bitter[193]. The quality varies from plant to plant and even from year to year from the same plant[193]. The fruit is up to 2cm long and contains a large number of flat seeds[193].",Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The unripe berries are the richest source[153, 173].","Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.",In warmer climates than Britain this plant is often used as a hedge[157].,,"Succeeds in most fertile soils in a sunny position[182]. Tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but is not very hardy in Britain. It sometimes succeeds as a shrub outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[166] but is more usually cut to the ground by winter cold. It can, however, be grown at the foot of a warm sunny wall and be treated as a herbaceous perennial. As long as the roots are given a good mulch in autumn they should survive quite cold winters[1, 166]. Alternatively, it is possible to grow the plant as an annual. If the seed is sown in early spring in a warm greenhouse and planted out after the last frosts it can fruit in its first year though yields will be lower than from plants grown as perennials[K]. There is much confusion between this species and S. aviculare. Some botanists unite the two under S. aviculare whilst others say that S. laciniatum is a tetraploid form of that species[50]. S. laciniatum is treated as a distinct species here[K].","Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse. Germinates in 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If growing the plants as annuals, plant them out after the last expected frosts and give them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing well. If growing as a perennial, especially in areas at the limits of its cold-hardiness, it will probably be better to grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Give them fairly large pots (12cm or larger) because they have very strong root growth. Top growth might die back over winter, but the roots should survive if temperatures in the greenhouse do not fall below about -5°c. Plant them out in early summer of the following year. The plants will be somewhat hardier in their second winter. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy, the cuttings root within a couple of weeks. Pot them up in fairly large pots and overwinter them in the greenhouse before planting out in early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
