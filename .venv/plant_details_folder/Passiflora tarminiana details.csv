24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"The plant grows well at elevations between 2,000 - 3,000 metres or even more in the tropics, succeeding at lower elevations as it moves away from the Equator[968 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade where it can grow up towards the sun[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 4.3 - 8[418 ]. A vigorous and disease-resistant species, it has escaped from cultivation in some areas, particularly New Zealand and Hawaii. It can invade native habitats, especially woodlands, and has been declared a noxious weed in both Hawaii and new Zealand[968 ]. The plant shows more resistance to pests and diseases than the related Passiflora tripartita mollissima[968 ]. This species hybridizes easily with other species in the subgenus Tacsonia[968 ]. Hybrids with Passiflora mixta and Passiflora tripartita are fertile and show intermediate phenotypes[968 ]. Hybrids with Passiflora cumbalensis can also produce fertile seed[968 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering."
