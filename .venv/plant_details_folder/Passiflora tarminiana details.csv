See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.,No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,Fruit: ,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.","erFruit - eaten raw or used in ice creams, fruit salads, pies, jellies, to make drinks etc[301 ]. The yellow, oblong, aromatic fruits are highly prized for their juice[301 ]. The fruit is about 100 - 140mm long and 35 - 45mm wide[968 ]. The fruits of this species are a deep yellow to orange colour, the pulp is less aromatic and tart than the flesh of the pale yellow fruits of Passiflora tripartita mollissima, but is also somewhat inferior in flavour[968 ]",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,Other Uses None known,,"The plant grows well at elevations between 2,000 - 3,000 metres or even more in the tropics, succeeding at lower elevations as it moves away from the Equator[968 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade where it can grow up towards the sun[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 4.3 - 8[418 ]. A vigorous and disease-resistant species, it has escaped from cultivation in some areas, particularly New Zealand and Hawaii. It can invade native habitats, especially woodlands, and has been declared a noxious weed in both Hawaii and new Zealand[968 ]. The plant shows more resistance to pests and diseases than the related Passiflora tripartita mollissima[968 ]. This species hybridizes easily with other species in the subgenus Tacsonia[968 ]. Hybrids with Passiflora mixta and Passiflora tripartita are fertile and show intermediate phenotypes[968 ]. Hybrids with Passiflora cumbalensis can also produce fertile seed[968 ].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
