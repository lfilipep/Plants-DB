13,Summary,"Bloom Color: White, Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rhus aromatica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 1.5 m (5ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Oil: ",
19,Edible Uses Description,"ruit - raw or cooked[2, 22]. The fruit is small with very little flesh, but it is easily harvested and when soaked for 10 - 30 minutes in hot or cold water makes a very refreshing lemonade-like drink (without any fizz of course)[61, 85, 183, K]. The mixture should not be boiled since this will release tannic acids and make the drink astringent. The fruit can also be dried and ground into a powder then mixed with corn meal and used in cakes, porridges etc[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diuretic  DysenteryThe leaves are astringent and diuretic[61, 222]. They were used in the treatment of colds, stomach aches and bleeding[222]. The root bark is astringent and diuretic[4, 222]. An infusion can be used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery. Used externally, it is used to treat excessive vaginal discharge and skin eruptions and also as a gargle for sore throats[254]. Its use is contraindicated if inflammation is present[222]. The root is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[254]. The fruits are astringent and diuretic[254]. They have been chewed in the treatment of stomach aches, toothaches and gripe[222] and used as a gargle to treat mouth and throat complaints[254]. They help reduce fevers and may be of help in treating late-onset diabetes[254]. Some caution is advised in the use of the leaves and stems of this plant, see the notes above on toxicity.",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Mordant: Used for making a dye more permanent, it also affects the colour of the dye.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are rich in tannin (up to 25%) and can be collected as they fall in the autumn then used as a brown dye or as a mordant[169]. The bark is also a good source of tannin[4]. An oil is extracted from the seeds[4]. It attains a tallow-like consistency on standing and is used to make candles. These burn brilliantly, though they emit a pungent smoke[4]. The plant has an extensive root system and is sometimes planted to prevent soil erosion[200]. The split stems are used in basket making[4, 46, 61].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Seashore, Woodland garden. Succeeds in a well-drained fertile soil in full sun[11, 200]. Tolerates poor soils[169, 200]. Established plants are drought resistant[169]. A very hardy plant when fully dormant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[184]. However, the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Many of the species in this genus are highly toxic and can also cause severe irritation to the skin of some people, whilst other species such as this one are not poisonous. It is relatively simple to distinguish which is which, the poisonous species have axillary panicles and smooth fruits whilst non-poisonous species have compound terminal panicles and fruits covered with acid crimson hairs[1, 4]. The toxic species are sometimes separated into their own genus, Toxicodendron, by some botanists[200]. This species is a low suckering shrub[182]. There is a specially low growing form, var. arenaria, that is found growing on sand dunes in the mid-west of N. America[184]. A polymorphic species[43]. Plants are susceptible to coral spot fungus[11]. Plants have brittle branches that are easily damaged in very strong winds[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species transplants easily[169]. The plant has an offensive smell[149]. Or, to go by another nose, the bruised leaves emit a delicious resinous scent[245]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water (starting at a temperature of 80 - 90c and allowing it to cool) prior to sowing in order to leach out any germination inhibitors[200]. This soak water can be drunk and has a delicious lemon-flavour. The stored seed also needs hot water treatment and can be sown in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long taken in December and potted up vertically in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78, 200]. Suckers in late autumn to winter[200].",
