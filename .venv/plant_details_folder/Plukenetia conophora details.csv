The seed is thin-shelled and about 25mm long[63 ]. The seed yields 48 - 60% of a light golden coloured oil with a flavour resembling linseed oil[332 ]. The oil comprises linolenic acid 64%; palmitic and stearic acids 15%; oleic acid 11 %; and linoleic acid 10%[332 ]. Fruit - eaten with rice[301 ]. Leaves and young shoots - eaten with rice[301 ]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: protein-oil (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].",

Known as awusa oil in the paint and varnish trade, it is usable in the paint industry provided there is a certain supply and the kernels are free from excessive free fatty acids[332 ]. It is unsuitable for soap-manufacture[332 ]. The fresh oil has an iodine value of 190, which is excellent for a drying oil, but the seeds do not store well and deterioration caused by enzymatic action needs to be prevented at the time of collection by heat-treatment[332 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilClimate: tropical. Humidity: humid. Cultivated in the hot and humid zones of tropical Africa around gardens and backyards, mainly for subsistence consumption. Grows on moist, deep, fertile, well-drained loam soils and in silt clay loam soils. Nut production is seasonal.  The kernels can yield 50-60% oil. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop only. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
