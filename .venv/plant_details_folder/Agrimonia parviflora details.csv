It usually germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 13°c[133], though germination rates can be low, especially if the seed has been stored[244]. A period of cold stratification helps but is not essential. When grown in pots, prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in autumn[200]. Very easy, the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions."
