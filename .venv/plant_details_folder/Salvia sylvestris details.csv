24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[200], it prefers a sunny position and a well-drained soil[190, 200], succeeding in dry soils[190]. Established plants are drought resistant[190]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. If the plants are dead-headed after flowering they will normally flower again later in the summer[190]. Plants have stout stems and require little if any staking[200]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[188]. This species is well suited to the wild garden, growing well in the summer meadow[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200].",
