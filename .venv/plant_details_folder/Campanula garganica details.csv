24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[221], it succeeds in most fertile well-drained soils[233], though it prefers a moist but well-drained sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Flowers most freely when growing in full sun with a good supply of chalk or lime in the soil[221]. Plants grow well in a wall so long as there is some soil for them to root into[219]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Plants are often short-lived, though they are easily propagated by seed or basal cuttings[219, 221]. They also usually self-sow freely[221]. This species is closely related to C. elatines[200]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Dickson's Gold' has golden-green leaves with a pleasant mild flavour[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. Very easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Very easy[221]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring."
