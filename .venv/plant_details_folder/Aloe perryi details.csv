0,Aloe perryi,Perry's Aloe,Xanthorrhoeaceae,10-12,"The sap of Aloe species contains anthraquinones. These compounds have several beneficial medicinal actions, particularly as a laxative, and many species of Aloe are thus employed in traditional medicine. Whilst safe in small doses and for short periods of time, anthraquinones do have potential problems if used in excess. These include congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs[ 299 ]. Long term use of anthraquinone laxatives may also play a role in development of colorectal cancer as they have genotoxic potential, and tumorigenic potential[ 299 ].","Mainly found in dry areas; on flat or gentle slopes, primarily on limestone pavement but occasionally on sandy plains or granite mountains; at elevations from sea-level to 900 metres[ 338 ].",Arabia - S. Yemen.,(0 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(4 of 5),"Tender,Well drained soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Aloe_perryi_Curtis, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Aloe_perryi_-_United_States_Botanic_Garden,_Washington._D.C._-_Stierch.jpg","Endemic to Socorta in Yemen, Perry's aloe (Aloe perryi) is a perennial plant that usually grows in rocky areas and can reach up to 30 cm tall. The leaves are green in color, succulent and thick, and with spines. The roots are fibrous and flowers are yellow to orange-red in color. It is used medicinally similar as to how Aloe vera is used. The leaves produce a gel that is used as treatment for wounds, burns, and other skin conditions. It is also used to cure haemorrhoids, sore throat and coughs, and as a laxative. Bitter aloe can also be obtained from the yellow sap at the base of the leaf of this species. It contains anthraquinones, a strong laxative and digestive stimulant, and can be used as treatment for asthma, coughs, dysentery, kidney problems, and dyspepsia when mixed with other ingredients. The plant is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping and container-growing.","Aloe perryi is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil and can tolerate drought.",,,None known,"Antiarthritic: Treats arthritis.,Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiarthritic  Antihaemorrhoidal  Antispasmodic  Bitter  Digestive  Dysentery  Kidney  Laxative  Purgative  Skin  VermifugeUsed medicinally in the same ways as Aloe vera[ 46 ]. Aloe vera is used in the following ways:- The clear gel contained within the leaf makes an excellent treatment for wounds, burns and a host of other skin disorders, placing a protective coat over the affected area, speeding up the rate of healing and reducing the risk of infection. The gel is also applied externally to cure haemorrhoids[ 254 , 299 , K ]. These actions are in part due to the presence of aloectin B, which stimulates the immune system[ 254 ]. To obtain this gel, the leaves can be cut in half along their length and the inner pulp rubbed over the affected area of skin[ K ]. This has an immediate soothing effect on all sorts of burns and other skin problems[ K ]. The use of the gel has been approved in the United States for the treatment of leukaemia in cats, of fibrosarcoma in dogs, for wound healing in humans and to prevent dry socket in humans[ 299 ]. The peeled leaves are eaten to relieve sore throat and coughs and as a mild laxative. As a food supplement, the leaf gel is said to facilitate digestion, and to improve blood and lymphatic circulation, as well as kidney, liver and gall bladder functions[ 299 ]. There are claims of beneficial activity of Aloe vera products in cases of AIDS, arthritis, or other chronic and debilitating conditions. However, these claims have not been substantiated by scientific studies. There is also no evidence that topical Aloe vera gel is effective in preventing or minimizing radiation-induced skin reactions in cancer patients. In large amounts, the gel has anti-irritant properties[ 299 ]. A bitter substance is obtained from the yellow sap at the base of the leaf. Known as 'bitter aloes', it contains anthraquinones which are a useful digestive stimulant and a strong laxative[ 254 ]. It also has vermicidal properties[ 299 ]. It is taken internally in the treatment of chronic constipation, poor appetite, digestive problems etc[ 238 ]. Mixed with other ingredients to mask its bitter taste, it is taken against asthma and to treat coughs. Similar mixtures are taken to cure dysentery, kidney problems or against dyspepsia[ 299 ]. It should be administered preferably in combination with an antispasmodic to moderate its griping action[ 299 ]. It is applied externally as a refrigerant to treat acne or cuts[ 299 ]. 'Cura'ao aloe' should contain at least 28% hydroxy-anthraquinone derivatives; it is almost entirely soluble in 60% alcohol and for more than 70% in water. It should not contain more than 12% moisture and 3% ash[ 299 ]. The plant is strongly purgative so great care should be taken over the dosage[ 238 ]. Anthraquinone-based laxatives, such as bitter aloes, should not be used longer than 8 - 10 days, nor by children younger than 12 years. Contra-indications include pregnancy, breastfeeding, intestinal inflammations and haemorrhoids[ 238 , 243 , 299 ]. When plants are grown in pots the anthraquinone content is greatly reduced[ 254 ].",,Other uses rating: Low (1/5). Suitable for xeriscaping. Suitable for growing in containers.,,"A plant of mainly arid and semi-arid lowland areas in the tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22° - 27°c, but can tolerate 12° - 31°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 5°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 400 - 700mm, but tolerates 250 - 1,400mm[ 418 ]. Tolerant of poor soils[ 200 ]. Requires a well-drained, light to medium soil and a position in full sun[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7, tolerating 6 - 7.5[ 418 ]. Aloe species follow the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). CAM plants can fix carbon dioxide at night and photosynthesize with closed stomata during the day, thus minimizing water loss. This, plus their succulent leaves and stems, and the presence of a thick cuticle, makes them well adapted to dry conditions[ 299 ].","Seed - we have no specific information on this species - in general Aloes are sown in a sandy, well-drained potting soil in a warm, shady position in standard seed trays. Germination takes about three weeks. Cover the seed with a thin layer of sand (1 - 2mm), keep moist. The seedlings can be planted out in individual bags or containers as soon as they are large enough to handle[ 295 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
