See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Z. alatum planispinum.

It can be ground into a powder and used as a condiment[183], a pepper substitute[2, 46, 177]. A light roasting brings out more of the flavour[206]. The seed is an ingredient of the famous Chinese 'five spice' mixture[206]. The peel is also used[105]. Young leaves are eaten[105, 177, 183]. No further details are given.","Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Stimulant  Stomachic  Tonic  VermifugeThe seeds and roots are stomachic and vermifuge[46, 61, 147]. A decoction of 7 - 14 seeds is used in the treatment of abscesses, arthritis, bruises, gastritis, swellings etc[218]. The resin contained in the bark, and especially in that of the roots, is powerfully stimulant and tonic[82].",,None known,,"Prefers a good deep well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is usually hardy in most parts of Britain but can be damaged in severe winters[11]. Fruits are freely produced after a hot summer[11]. The flowers are formed on the old wood[206]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Stored seed may requires up to 3 months cold stratification, though scarification may also help[113]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. Germination should take place in late spring, though it might take another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Root cuttings, 3cm long, planted horizontally in pots in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78]. Suckers, removed in late winter and planted into their permanent positions[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
