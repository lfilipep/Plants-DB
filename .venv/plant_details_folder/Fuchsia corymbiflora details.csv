24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil[200]. Requires a moist position[3]. Prefers semi-shade and a sheltered site[15]. Succeeds in a good loam if leafmold and sand are added[1]. This species requires a minimum winter temperature of 5°c in order to succeed, it does well in a cool conservatory[3, 48]. Plants have survived outdoors on our trial ground in Cornwall since 1992, with no losses even in colder winters. The plants die down in late autumn and will start to regrow during mild spells in the winter and spring. This new growth is usually killed by the next period of cold weather, but this does not seem to cause lasting damage, the plants growing away well in late spring. It is a good idea to apply a good mulch of organic matter as soon as the plant dies down, so that the roots are protected from any periods of severe cold[K]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[108]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K]. Plants have a tuberous root system and produce suckers. These can be removed and potted up at any time during the growing season. Keep them in a greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]."
