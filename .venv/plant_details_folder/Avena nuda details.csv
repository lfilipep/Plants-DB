17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[2, 22, 46, 61, 171, 177]. The seed ripens in the latter half of summer and, when harvested and dried, can store for several years. It has a floury texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour. It can be used as a staple food crop in either savoury or sweet dishes. The seed can be cooked whole, though it is more commonly ground into a flour and used as a cereal in all the ways that oats are used, especially as a porridge but also to make biscuits, sourdough bread etc. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw or cooked in salads, stews etc. The hull is incompletely attached to the grain, yielding a naked seed easily upon threshing[183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The straw has a wide range of uses such as for bio-mass, fibre, mulch, paper-making and thatching[171]. Some caution is advised in its use as a mulch since oat straw can infest strawberries with stem and bulb eelworm.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. Prefers a poor dry soil[134]. The naked oat is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed which is easily separated from the husk by threshing[183]. It is therefore suitable for cultivation on a small scale, though its yields are lower than conventional oat species[183]. There are some named varieties[183]. Oats are in general easily grown plants but, especially when grown on a small scale, the seed is often completely eaten out by birds. Some sort of netting seems to be the best answer on a garden scale.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ in early spring or in the autumn. Only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.,
