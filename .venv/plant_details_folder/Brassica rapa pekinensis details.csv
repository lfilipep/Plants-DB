13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Brassica rapa pekinensis is a ANNUAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[116, 160, 171]. A crisp, watery texture with a naturally sweet taste, it is best eaten raw in salads[116, 206]. The plant can be eaten as a young seedling, or left to grow into a mature plant[206]. The flavour is quickly ruined by prolonged cooking[206]. Leaves can also be dried for winter use[206]. The heads of mature plants can be 50cm long and weigh up to 4.5 kg[200, 206]. Fresh leaves do not store well and are best used within a day or two of harvesting[206]. A nutritional analysis is available[218]. Flowering shoots - raw or cooked[206]. Sweet and tender[133]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DepurativeThe leaves are depurative[218].

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[16, 52, 200]. Succeeds in acid and alkaline soils[166, 200]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 to 7[206]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 6.8. Prefers a heavy soil[16] and grows badly in sandy ones[200]. Prefers full sun[200, 206] and a sheltered position[206]. Likes some shade[16]. Drought resistant according to one report[160], whilst another says that the plants are shallow-rooted and have very little resistance to drought[206]. They require about 5 gallons of water from sowing to maturity[206]. Plants are not fully winter hardy in Britain, though mature plants withstand light frosts to about -3°c[160, 206]. Plants prefer coolish weather during their growing season, a temperature range of 13 - 20°c is ideal[206]. The Chinese cabbage is widely cultivated, especially in China and Japan, for its edible leaves[88]. It looks like a large cos lettuce or cabbage and has a crisp, watery texture with a mustard-like taste[264]. There are many named varieties[88, 206]. Those forms with loose heads were developed for areas with hotter summers, whilst compact-headed forms were developed for cooler areas[206]. The loose-headed forms are less prone to bolt, are more resistant to cold and are more disease-resistant[206]. An annual to biennial species, it is normally grown as an annual[206]. Plants take from 55 - 100 days from sowing to maturity, depending on variety, the loose-headed forms are usually 2 - 3 weeks faster than compact-headed forms[206]. Plants do not like root disturbance so should not be transplanted unless grown in individual pots[206]. Plants are highly resistant to fungus attacks and the cabbage moth[160], they are also slow to bolt in hot weather[160]. Some cultivars are more resistant to bolting when sown in spring than other forms[206]. There is some evidence that interplanting this species with dill and garlic can lessen the attacks of caterpillars[206]. A good bee plant[108]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it can be sown from late May to September in situ[206]. The spring sown crops often run to seed very quickly but 'barrel' types can be sown at this time. If seedlings are germinated at a temperature of 18 - 20°c and then grown on at this temperature for their first few weeks, they are then less likely to bolt[206]. Seed usually germinates within 3 - 4 days[206]. A late summer sowing under protection can provide leaves in the winter[206]. Seedlings can be transplanted when about 3 - 4 weeks old[206]."
