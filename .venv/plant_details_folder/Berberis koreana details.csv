Form: Rounded, Upright or erect, Vase.","Berberis koreana is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.5 m (5ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,Fruit - raw or cooked. The fruits are about 5mm long[200]. Young leaves - cooked[177].,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  DysenteryBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A yellow dye is obtained from the root.,,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Pest tolerant, Hedge, Massing, Screen, Superior hedge, Woodland garden. Prefers a warm moist loamy soil and light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[200]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely, they resprout well from the base[200]. Very stoloniferous, plants produce suckers freely[67, 200]. A very ornamental plant[67], it is closely related to B. vulgaris[1]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. The flowers are produced late in spring, thereby escaping spring frosts[67]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]. Suckers, removed in late autumn/early winter and planted out in situ or potted up and planted out in late spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
