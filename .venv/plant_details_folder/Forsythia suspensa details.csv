It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Syringa suspensa.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover;,Leaves: ,Rutin: often used as a food supplement.,"Young leaves - cooked[105, 177, 179].

A bitter tasting pungent herb with an antiseptic effect, it is chiefly used to treat boils, carbuncles, mumps and infected neck glands[254]. The fruit is a bitter astringent herb that stimulates the heart, nervous system and gall bladder[238]. It contains vitamin P, which is used to strengthen capillaries[238]. The fruit is also antidote, antiphlogistic, antitussive, diuretic, emmenagogue, febrifuge, laxative and tonic[116, 147, 174, 176, 178, 218, 238]. It is used internally in the treatment of acute infectious diseases such as mumps, and also for tonsillitis, urinary tract infections allergic rashes etc[238]. The fruit is harvested when fully ripe and is dried for use in decoctions[238]. The plant has a similar action to Lonicera japonica and is usually used in combination with that species to achieve a stronger action[176]. The flowers have a broad-spectrum antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysenteriae, haemolytic streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Bacillus typhi, Mycobacterium tuberculi etc[176]. The plant is vermifuge, though the part used is not stated[116, 147, 174, 178]. The leaves are febrifuge and are also poulticed onto ulcerated glands and haemorrhoids[218]. A decoction of the leaves and twigs is used in the treatment of breast cancer[61]. The root is used in the treatment of cancer, colds, fever and jaundice[218].",,"The sub-species F. suspensa sieboldii is a lax grower that roots freely where the branches touch the ground. It makes a very good tall ground cover when planted about 2.5 metres apart each way[208]. Landscape Uses: Border, Erosion control, Espalier, Massing, Screen.",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in all soil types[202] but prefers a rich soil. Succeeds in limey soils. Grows well in heavy clay soils. It prefers a sunny position but succeeds in semi shade though it is apt to get leggy if grown in the shade of trees[182]. Succeeds against a north-facing wall[219]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. The flowers are produced quite early in the year and are frost-resistant[182]. Plants are medium to fast growing[202]. Flowers are produced on wood that is more than one year old[202]. Any pruning is best done after the plant has finished flowering[182]. A very ornamental plant, there are several named varieties[182]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 2 months[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 15cm taken at a node, July/August in a frame. Plant out in autumn or spring. A very high percentage, they root within 3 weeks[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in a sheltered outdoor bed. Good percentage[78]. Layering in spring or summer. Plants often self-layer[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
