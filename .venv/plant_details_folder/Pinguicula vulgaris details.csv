Its main application is as a cough remedy[254]. The leaves are antispasmodic and antitussive[7, 13]. The plant is an effective treatment for whooping cough[7]. Used externally as a poultice, it has a healing effect on the skin[7]. The leaves are harvested in early summer as the plant comes into flower and are dried for later use[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of whooping cough and nervous throat irritations[9]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,A colouring substance is obtained from the leaves[7].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a boggy soil[1]. Because of their insectivorous habit, plants are able to succeed on soils very deficient in nitrogen. Butterwort is an insectivorous plant, the leaves are sticky and trap insects which are then digested by the plant[7]. Plants overwinter as a tight winter-resting bud with virtually no roots[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the summer if this is possible otherwise in early spring. Place the pots in shallow water to keep them moist. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two growing seasons. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of the resting buds in the winter[200]. Leaf cuttings."
