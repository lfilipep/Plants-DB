Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Pyramidal, Rounded.","Taxus cuspidata is an evergreen Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or made into jam[105, 183]. Very sweet and gelatinous, most people find it delicious though some find it sickly. The fruit is a fleshy berry about 8mm in diameter and containing a single seed[200]. All other parts of this plant, including the seed, are highly poisonous. When eating the fruit you should spit out the large seed found in the fruit's centre. Should you swallow the whole seed it will just pass straight through you without harm, if the seed has been bitten into, however, it could cause some problems.",Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerModern research has shown that yew trees contain the substance 'taxol' in their shoots and bark. Taxol has shown exciting potential as an anti-cancer drug, particularly in the treatment of ovarian cancers[218, 238]. This remedy is very toxic and, even when used externally, should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. A compound used to treat diabetes is extracted from the wood, bark, leaves, and roots[266].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A brown dye is obtained from the heartwood[46, 61]. Red according to another report[266]. An oil is extracted from the seeds[266].  - hard, strong, elastic, fine grained, takes a beautiful polish. Used for furniture, bows etc[1, 46, 61]. The wood is used in building construction, furniture manufacture and as a carving material[266].",,"Landscape Uses:Hedge, Screen, Superior hedge, Specimen. Thrives in almost any soil, acid or alkaline, as long as it is well-drained[1, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Very shade tolerant[81]. The dormant plant is hardy to about -35°c[200] but it requires more summer heat and humidity than T. baccata and is rarely more than a shrub in Britain[81]. Young shoots can be damaged by late spring frosts. The foliage may turn reddish-brown in cold winters[81]. There are several named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188]. Plants produce very little fibrous root and should be planted in their final positions when still small[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed is required. Female plants fruit freely in Britain if they are pollinated[11, 185]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - can be very slow to germinate, often taking 2 or more years[78, 80]. It is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn when it should germinate 18 months later. Stored seed may take 2 years or more to germinate. 4 months warm followed by 4 months cold stratification may help reduce the germination time[113]. Harvesting the seed 'green' (when fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and then sowing it immediately has not been found to reduce the germination time because the inhibiting factors develop too early[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in pots in a cold frame. The seedlings are very slow-growing and will probably require at least 2 years of pot cultivation before being large enough to plant out. Any planting out is best done in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 8cm long, July/August in a shaded frame. Should root by late September but leave them in the frame over winter and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[11]. Cuttings of ripe terminal shoots, taken in winter after a hard frost, in a shaded frame[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
