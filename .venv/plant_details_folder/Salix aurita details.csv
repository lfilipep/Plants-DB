13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix aurita is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft 2in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.",
19,Edible Uses Description,,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  FebrifugeThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants have an extensive root system and are used to stabilize waste tips and old slag heaps[199]. The seeds are very light and so can travel some distance in the wind. The plant is therefore able to find its way to areas such as cleared woodland where the soil has been disturbed. Seedlings will grow away quickly, even in exposed conditions and the plant will provide good shelter for the establishment of woodland plants. Thus it makes a good pioneer species and, except in wetter and moorland-type soils, will eventually be largely out-competed by the other woodland trees. Its main disadvantage as a pioneer plant is that it has an extensive root system and is quite a greedy plant, thus it will not help as much in enriching the soil for the other woodland plants as other pioneer species such as the alders, Alnus species[K]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Thriving in the most adverse conditions, it is a useful plant for populating dry barren sites[199]. Closely related to S. caprea and S. cinerea[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. When inhaled near to, a scent of white jasmine can be discerned from the flowers[245]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.",
