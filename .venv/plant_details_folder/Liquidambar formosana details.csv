Form: Oval, Pyramidal.","Liquidambar formosana is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",L. acerifolia.,Woodland Garden Secondary;,None known,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Balsamic: A healing and soothing agent.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The stem is anodyne, antiphlogistic, astringent, balsamic and haemostatic[178, 218]. The resin from the stems is mixed with Rhamnus crenata fruits and used as a suppository for constipation[218]. The stem bark is used in the treatment of fluxes and skin diseases[218]. The fruits are antirheumatic, diuretic and galactogogue[176]. They are used in the treatment of arthritis, lumbago, oedema, oliguria, decreased milk production and skin diseases[176, 218]. The root is used in the treatment of cancerous growths[218]. The resin from the stems is used to treat bleeding boils, carbuncles, toothache and tuberculosis[218].","Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","An aromatic resin is obtained from the trunk of this tree[4]. It forms in cavities of the bark and is harvested in autumn. It is used medicinally[178]. . Used to make tea chests for higher grade teas[1, 46, 61].",,"Landscape Uses:Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Prefers a moist but not swampy loam in a sunny sheltered position[1, 200]. Succeeds in light shade[188]. Requires a deep fertile soil[200]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil, growing poorly on shallow soils overlying chalk[188]. Not all introductions of this species are hardy[11]. The Monticola group, which comes from western Hubei and north-eastern Sichuan, tolerates temperatures lower than -5°c[200, 260]. Young plants are susceptible to frost damage and should be protected for their first few years[200]. This species resents root disturbance, young plants should be pot-grown and be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Harvest the seed capsules at the end of October or November, dry in a warm place and extract the seed by shaking the capsule. Stored seed requires 1 - 3 months stratification and sometimes takes 2 years to germinate. Sow it as early in the year as possible. Germination rates are often poor. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first winter. Since they resent root disturbance, it is best to plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their second year and give them some protection from cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Suckers in early spring. Layering in October/November.
