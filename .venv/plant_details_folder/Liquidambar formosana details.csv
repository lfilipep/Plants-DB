22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Prefers a moist but not swampy loam in a sunny sheltered position[1, 200]. Succeeds in light shade[188]. Requires a deep fertile soil[200]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil, growing poorly on shallow soils overlying chalk[188]. Not all introductions of this species are hardy[11]. The Monticola group, which comes from western Hubei and north-eastern Sichuan, tolerates temperatures lower than -5°c[200, 260]. Young plants are susceptible to frost damage and should be protected for their first few years[200]. This species resents root disturbance, young plants should be pot-grown and be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Harvest the seed capsules at the end of October or November, dry in a warm place and extract the seed by shaking the capsule. Stored seed requires 1 - 3 months stratification and sometimes takes 2 years to germinate. Sow it as early in the year as possible. Germination rates are often poor. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first winter. Since they resent root disturbance, it is best to plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their second year and give them some protection from cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Suckers in early spring. Layering in October/November. Takes 12 months.",
