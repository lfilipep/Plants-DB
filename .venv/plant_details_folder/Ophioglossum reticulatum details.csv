0,Ophioglossum reticulatum,Adder's tongue fern,Ophioglossaceae,10-12,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200 ]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172 ].","Grassland in open damp sandy soil at elevations up to 1,500 metres in Africa[200 , 299 ]. Moist sandy soils, seasonally wet soils, along roads, on termite hills, in montane grassland among rocks and forest margins, from sea-level up to 2,500 metres[299 ].",Pantropical.,(4 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Ophioglossum_reticulatum_Hooker_1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Ophioglossum_reticulatum_Hooker_2.JPEG","Ophioglossum reticulatum is a tropical, perennial fern growing up to 35 cm high with fronds that are oval with heart-shaped base. The rhizome is erect and cylindrical, exhibiting many thin roots. The plant is a popular nutritious vegetable. The fronds, in particular, are cooked (blanched) or used in salads. A decoction of the rhizome is used topically on boils. The leaves, on the other hand are boiled in oil and applied to wounds. Leaf juice is drunk against spasms of the heart. Plant is grown from spores or rhizome.",Ophioglossum reticulatum is a deciduous Fern growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.,,,Leaves: ,,Young fronds are commonly eaten as a salad or vegetable[332 ]. A sweet flavour[46 ].

Plants are not normally cultivated as a food crop, but are sometimes grown in pots for medicinal use[299]. The presence of alkaloids, arbutin, amygdalin, saponin, formic acid and oxalic acid has been shown.",,"Widespread in tropical and subtropical areas of the Neotropics and Palaeotropics. Typically found thriving in shallow soil on rock shelves fully exposed to sunlight. However, it can also inhabit various woodland environments, whether dense forests or open woodlands. The plant can become a weed of agriculture but does little harm because of its small size[299 ]. When grown from spores, plants can be harvested for their leaves after 1 - 2 years[299 ]. When grown from rhizomes collected from the wild, harvesting may start after about six months[299 ]. The fronds are irresistible to insects and molluscs[200 ]. The Adder's tongue fern is naturally distributed in Africa, specifically in grasslands with open, damp, sandy soil, at elevations of up to 1,500 meters. It can also be found in moist sandy soils, seasonally wet soils, on termite hills, in montane grasslands among rocks and forest margins, and at various elevations ranging from sea level up to 2,500 meters.",Spores - very difficult to germinate[200 ].
