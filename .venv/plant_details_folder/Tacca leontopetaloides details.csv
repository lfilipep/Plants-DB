It is perennial, with a single stem around 1 m in height from a tuberous rootstock. The leaves are large and the flowers are in greenish-purple clusters, with long trailing bracts. The tubers are hard, brown on the outside but white on the inside. It contains starch, thus made into a flour for various uses like in breads and soups. Polynesian arrowroot is also used in traditional medicine for eye problems, diarrhea, dysentery, sores, burns, wasp stings, and ear pains. Leaf stalks are made into an excellent straw for hats, brooms, or other uses. Plants are grown from division of the small tubers or from seeds.","Tacca leontopetaloides is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Chaitaea tacca Sol. ex Seem.

It can be eaten raw or roasted, or the starch can be extracted[301 ]. The tubers have eyes, a pale-yellow skin and dull-whitish flesh, and are usually bitter and almost inedible when raw[429 ]. The starch, called Tahiti (or Fiji) arrowroot, is easy to extract and is used in breads or soups, it can be mixed with papayas, bananas and pumpkins, flavoured with vanilla and lemon, and cooked into poi[301 , 429 ]. Good washing is essential because of the presence of the bitter substance (taccalin) which is said to be poisonous[451 ]. To obtain the starch, the tubers are peeled, grated, and the resultant pulp washed in water several times, finally in a sieve or cloth. The aqueous starch solution is collected and the starch grains allowed to settle out, collected and dried in the sun[429 ]. In cultivated plants the tuber can be 5 - 10cm long, with unconfirmed reports saying that it may reach the size of a coconut[451 ].","Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.

The inside of the root is squeezed in water and applied as a rinse to injured eyes. The starch from the tubers of the plant was used as a remedy for diarrhoea and dysentery[311 ]. The root is also used as a thickener in medical preparations[311 ]. The starch from the root is rubbed onto sores and burns[311 ]. The crushed leaf stalks of the plant are rubbed onto bee and wasp stings[311 ].

The straw is split into narrow strips then cured and dried. It is said to make an excellent, lightweight, glossy, white hat[459 ]. The leaf stalks are made into brooms[454 ]. The fresh starch extracted from the roots is used as a starch for clothes and as a glue[459 ]. Traditionally, it is employed for pasting together the thin layers of beaten bark of the paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera] in making tapa cloth[459 ].",,"A plant of low elevations in the moist tropics, where it is most commonly found near the sea and below elevations of 200 metres[429 ]. Grows best in a fertile, humus-rich soil in the shade of trees[200 ]. Plants can set seed three years from being a seedling[451 ]. The tuber is replaced during the year by a new main tuber which arises from a downward-growing runner-like thick rhizome at a lower level and remains dormant after the yearly death of the aerial parts of the original plant[451 ]. Tubers are harvested when the aerial parts have died off[451 ]. It usually takes about 8 months from planting the crop to harvest, but sometimes it can be as much as 10 - 12 months[429 ]. Most plants produce many starchy tubers, similar in appearance to potatoes, usually 10 - 15 cm in diameter, but they can reach 30 cm on rich soils[429 ]. They normally weigh from 70 to 340g but can reach 1 kg[429 ]. Two distinct forms have been reported from the Pacific Islands, one producing a single large tuber, the other with a number of smaller (potato-sized) tubers[429 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Spring Late Summer/Early Fall Blooms repeatedly. Bloom Color: Dark Purple/Black.","Seed - Division of the small, tuberous rhizomes which form at the base of the plant and often remain in the soil when the larger ones are harvested[429 ]",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
