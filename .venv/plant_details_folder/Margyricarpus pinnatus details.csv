See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",M. setosus. Empetrum pinnatum.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105]. Pleasant but mild with a slightly acid flavour[11, 183]. The fruit can hang on the plant for a long time in good condition if it is not eaten by birds etc[1]. The fruit is a small white berry about 7mm in diameter with a single seed[200]. Very attractive to look at, but the flavour is very mild and you need to spend quite a while picking just to get one mouthful[K]. Children really love the fuit, however, and this makes it an ideal plant to get them out of your hair for a while. Simply tell them that they can have as much of the fruit as they want and they will be there for half an hour or more picking it[K].","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Requires a sunny position and a well-drained soil[11]. Requires a sheltered position[188]. Plants are low-growing and have done very well in our exposed maritime site in Cornwall[K]. This species is hardy to about -5°c[200]. It is our opinion that the plants are hardier than this[K], they have grown outdoors in many parts of Britain that experience colder winters, and have survived all but very severe winters[1, 11]. The plants do not fruit well in cool wet summers[K].","Seed - sow late winter or early spring in a greenhouse[78]. The seed can be rather slow to germinate and probably needs a short period of cold stratification[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. When the plants are large enough, plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors[K].
