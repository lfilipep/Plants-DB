See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower in March, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",A. xalapensis. non H.B.K..,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A sweetish taste[149], the fruit has a dry mealy flesh[181]. It has narcotic properties[181]. The fruit is up to 1cm in diameter[229].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is a good fuel and also produces a fine grade of charcoal[149, 229].",,"Requires a lime-free nutrient-rich well-drained moisture-retentive soil in sun or semi-shade and shelter from cold drying winds, especially when young[200]. Succeeds on dry soils[82]. This species is unlikely to be hardy in the colder areas of the country, it probably tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. There is some confusion over the name of this plant, some books suggest that A texana is a synonym of A xalapensis. HBK. whilst others say that A texana exists in its own right and has a synonym of A. xalapensis. non HBK[11, 149, 200]. A. texana is very closely related to A. xalapense and is considered by many botanists to be indistinguishable from that species[274].","Seed - best surface sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed should be soaked for 5 - 6 days in warm water and then surface sown in a shady position in a greenhouse[78]. Do not allow the compost to become dry. 6 weeks cold stratification helps[134]. The seed usually germinates well in 2 - 3 months at 20°c[134]. Seedlings are prone to damp off[184], they are best transplanted to individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and should be kept well ventilated. Grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts[K]. Basal cuttings in late winter[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November/December in a frame. Poor percentage[78]. Layering of young wood - can take 2 years[1, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
