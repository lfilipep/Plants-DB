24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Requires a very well-drained light sandy soil in a sunny position[200]. Prefers a rich soil[1]. Plants can be killed by excessive winter wet[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200]."
