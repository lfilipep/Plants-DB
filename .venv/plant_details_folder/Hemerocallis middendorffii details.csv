2,Family,Hemerocallidaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"Large quantities of the leaves are said to be hallucinogenic. Blanching the leaves removes this hallucinatory component[205]. (This report does not make clear what it means by blanching, it could be excluding light from the growing shoots or immersing in boiling water[K].)"
5,Habitats,"Meadows in high mountains of N. Japan[58]. Forests, forest margins, meadows and wet grasslands from near sea level to 2000 metres in China[266]."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked[105, 116, 177, 183]. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[105, 177, 183]. The flowers can be dried and used as a thickener in soups etc. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Vitamin CThe juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205].
22,Other Uses,"Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205]. Plants form a spreading clump and are suitable for ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. The dead leaves should be left on the ground in the winter to ensure effective cover[208]. (This report was for a plant labelled H. middendorfiana, which I have assumed is a mis-spelling of this species[K]). Attractive flowers."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Seashore. Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil and a sunny position[111] but tolerating partial shade[88]. Plants flower less freely in a shady position though the flowers can last longer in such a position[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Individual flowers are short-lived, but the plant produces a succession of blooms and also flowers again in late summer[205]. The plant has a fibrous root system that does not extend far[205]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved but then form large clumps[200, 187]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
