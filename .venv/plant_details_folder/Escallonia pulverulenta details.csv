Only hardy in the milder areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[200]. A very erect shrub[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details on this plant but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Either put the cuttings in individual pots or pot them up as soon as they start to root. Easy[K]. Cuttings of mature wood in winter. Very easy, just plant the cuttings direct into their final positions, about 95% usually take[29, K]. Keep them moist in a dry spring."
