Tolerates maritime exposure and salt spray[154, 157, 167]. This species is not very hardy in mainland Britain, it succeeds outdoors on the Scilly Isles[1] but usually requires greenhouse protection elsewhere[1]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. There is some confusion over this name. [154] gives M. serrata as a synonym of this species whilst [200] says that M. serrata is a synonym of M. tetrandrum. We have followed this last treatment. Closely related to M. ellipticum and M. montanum (Syn M. acuminatum)[193].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn.
