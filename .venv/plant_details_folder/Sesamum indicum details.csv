(1753) and S. indicum L. have equal priority. DC. (Pl. Rar. Jard. Geneve 16-19. 1825) accepted S. orientale and cited S. indicum as a synonym. The conservation of S. indicum, however, has precedence over S. orientale.","Sesamum indicum is a ANNUAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender.  It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",S. orientale.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Oil: ,Oil: ","ed - cooked[1, 2, 4, 34, 46]. Usually roasted or stewed, it can also be ground into a powder and used as a flour, added to breads, vegetables etc, used to make sweetmeats, or crushed and used as a butter or as 'tahini'[14, 21, 183, 238]. It can also be fermented into 'tempeh', ground into a powder and mixed with a sweetener to make 'halva', or made into a paste and used as the spread 'tahini'[183, 238]. The seeds can also be sprouted and used in salads[183]. The seed contains about 21.5% protein, 60.8% fat, 8.9% carbohydrate, 3.4% ash[179]. It is a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, calcium and vitamins A, B and E[201, 238]. The calcium is absorbed well by the body, making sesame an excellent dietary source[238]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[2, 34, 46, 57]. It is used for cooking or in margarines etc[14, 183]. The oil is very stable and will keep for years without turning rancid[61, 117, 201]. Leaves - raw or cooked as a potherb or added to soups[105, 117, 183].","Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.

The leaves are rich in a gummy matter and when mixed with water they form a rich bland mucilage that is used in the treatment of infant cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, catarrh and bladder troubles[4, 238]. The seed is diuretic, emollient, galactogogue, lenitive and tonic[218], and acts as a tonic for the liver and kidneys[238]. It is taken internally in the treatment of premature hair loss and greying, convalescence, chronic dry constipation, dental caries, osteoporosis, stiff joints, dry cough etc[238]. It has a marked ability to increase milk production in nursing mothers[254]. Externally it is used to treat haemorrhoids and ulcers[238, 240]. The seed is very high in calories and so should be used with caution by people who are overweight[238]. The oil is laxative and also promotes menstruation[4]. It is used to treat dry constipation in the elderly[238]. Mixed with lime water, the oil is used externally to treat burns, boils and ulcers[238]. A decoction of the root is used in various traditions to treat asthma and coughs[254].","Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps.

Apart from being edible, it is also used in soap making, lighting, as a lubricant and a source of pharmaceutical drugs etc[21, 46, 61, 238]. When added to the insecticide pyrethrum it acts as a synergist, a 10% content of oil doubling the potency of the pyrethrum[57, 174]. The oil can also be used in barrier creams to protect the skin from harmful UV light radiation[201].",,"Sesame can be grown from the warm temperate zone to the tropics, so long as there is a growing season of at least 5 months. In the tropics, it can be grown at elevations up to 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range of 20 - 30°c, but can tolerate 10 - 40°c[418]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 500 - 1,000mm, but tolerates 300 - 1,500mm[418]. High relative humidity or heavy rains may increase the incidence of fungal diseases[418].Requires a well-drained porous soil and a warm sunny sheltered position[1, 238]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils of moderate fertility[18]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418]. A sheltered position is preferred, sesame is susceptible to wind damage after the main stem has elongated[418].Depending upon variety, a crop of sesame can be produced within 40 - 180 days from sowing the seed[418].The average yield of sesame seed in the world is about 350 kilos per hectare, but yields can be up to 3 tonnes[418].There are many named varieties[183].Sesame grows well with sweet corn but it grows badly with sorghum[201]. The British climate is probably too cool in the summer to successfully grow this crop, though some people have reported success[206]. Early sowing in the greenhouse and some protection when first planting it out will help. Sesame grows well with sweet corn but it grows badly with sorghum[201].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Give them the protection of a cloche until they are growing away well[K]. In warm temperate zones, where frosts are very rare and light, or non-existent, the seed can be sown in situ in the spring or the autumn[238].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
