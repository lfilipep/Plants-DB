0,Prunus simonii,Apricot Plum,Rosaceae,5-9,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",Not known in a truly wild situation.,E. Asia - N. China.,(3 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PrunusSimonii.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Prunus simonii is a deciduous Tree growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Fragrant and fleshy[1]. Aromatic and very palatable[11, K]. The fruit can be very variable in quality, some trees have agreeably flavoured fruits whilst on others the fruit is harsh with an almond-like astringency[46, 61, 183]. A very good size, the fruit is up to 60mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil, growing well on limestone[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Grows well in damp climates but the fruit is then inclined to rot[74]. This species rarely fruits well in Britain due to the flowers being damaged by frosts[1, 11]. There is a hybrid with P. salicina that has frost-resistant fruits, one of the cultivars selected from this hybridization is called 'Kara'. A rather old looking tree at Cambridge Botanical Gardens was only 2.5 metres tall and looking very unhealthy in 1989. It was bearing a few fruits in the September of that year after a very hot summer[K]. The tree was not seen in a visit in 1993[K]. Much cultivated in China for its edible fruit, there are mant named varieties[266]. The plant is widely used in breeding programmes, especially with P. salicina, for improved fruiting cultivars[183]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200].
