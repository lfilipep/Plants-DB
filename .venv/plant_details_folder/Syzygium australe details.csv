Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant has a very dense habit of growth and responds well to trimming. It is often grown as a hedge, especially the cultivar 'Brilliant'[K]. The reddish or yellowish wood is light, elastic and seasons well[46]. It is used for making oars, boat building etc, and was traditionally used for making boomerangs and shields[46].We do not have any more specific information for the wood of this species, but the various species of Syzygium tend to have somewhat similar timber. The general description of syzygium timber is as follows:-The heartwood is a golden brown, greyish brown or brown, with pink or purplish glints; it is not clearly demarcated from the 1 - 4cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain slightly interlocked, sometimes wavy or irregular; there are resin deposits. The wood is heavy; moderately hard; somewhat durable, being moderately resistant to fungi and termites, but susceptible to dry wood borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It works well with ordinary tools, nailing and screwing are good so long as the wood is pre-bored; gluing is correct. The wood is used for musical instruments, tool handles, furniture components, shipbuilding, heavy carpentry, flooring, joinery etc[848].",,"A tree of warm temperate and subtropical climates, just reaching into tropical areas[397]. It is tolerant of occasional, light frosts[694].Succeeds in full sun and in partial shade[694]. Prefers rich soils and assured moisture[397]. Succeeds in most soils[694].Several named forms have been developed for ornamental purposes, including some compact forms that grow no larger than 2 metres[397].","Seed - best sown when fresh. Either the whole fruit can be sown, or the seed can be separated from the flesh[397]. Germination usually takes 1 - 2 months but, especially if not sown fresh, maybe slow and spasmodic[397, 694]. Cuttings of firm, current season's growth[397].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
