13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Panicum maximum is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked. Small and very fiddly to collect any quantity, it is generally only used in times of food shortage[332 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The plant is said to be diuretic, laxative and preventitive[269 , 332 ]. It is used in the treatment of heartburn and tympanitis[269 , 310 ]. Sap from the crushed fresh plant is used as a cicatrisant on wounds and sores[332 ]. The grass is tied around the head in order to bring relief from a headache[332 ]."
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
23,Other Uses Description,The plant has been suggested as a biofuel for producing alcohol[269 ]. The straw is useful for thatching[332 ]. The culms serve as brooms[332 ]. The culms are used for basket weaving[332 ].
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Pasture  Management: Hay  Minor Global Crop  Staple Crop: ProteinA plant of the subtropical to tropical zones, where it is found at elevations up to 2,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 19 - 30°c, but can tolerate 6 - 35°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,800mm, but tolerates 650 - 4,300mm[418 ]. Prefers a lightly shaded position, but succeeds in full sun and quite deep shade[418 ]. It grows especially well in shaded, damp areas under trees and shrubs[295 ]. Grows best in a fertile, humus-rich loam, but tolerates most soil types and also low fertility[418 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil, but tolerant of seasonal inundation[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 7, tolerating 3.5 - 8.4[418 ]. The plant is a very effective coloniser in ungrazed areas, particularly where some form of soil disturbance has occurred[415 ]. It is well adapted to sloping, cleared land in rain forest areas. It can be an aggressive invader of annual and perennial crops in Brazil[418 ]. The plant may become a persistent weed, especially in cultivated areas such as sugarcane fields. It should be controlled in the seedling stage, as it is very difficult to remove later when the grass has reached maturity[295 ]. Yields of dry matter may be 6 - 60 tonnes per hectare[418 ]. Although plants seed readily, heads ripen very unevenly and shatter readily. Hence seed must be hand-collected. Viability of the fresh seed is comparatively low - it is increased by storing the seeds dry for 6 - 18 months[269 , 415 ]. Seed viability under natural conditions is short-lived. The plants should be allowed to reseed themselves at periodic intervals to insure stand maintenance[269 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - there is an initial dormancy when first harvested, which can last for up to 18 months. This can be overcome by the removal of glumes from the fresh seed[415 ]. The seed is usually sown in situ - only cover it lightly and then roll the ground[415 ]. Stems of guinea grass root freely from nodes when in contact with moist soil but, as a result of its erect growth habit, such rooted creeping stolons are rarely seen in the field[310 ]. Crops may also be established by propagating by sprigs, or by dividing the stools[269 ]."
