Prefers a neutral to slightly acid soil[200]. Grows well in open woodland[1]. Succeeds in a sunny position if the soil does not dry out[42]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Any transplanting is best done whilst the plants are in flower[200]. Plants can flower in two years from seed[138].","Seed - best sown in a shaded cold frame as soon as it is ripe[134, 200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring. Seed usually germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c. Another report says that seeds produce a root after the first cold stratification but no shoot is produced until after a second winter[138]. The seedlings are prone to damp off and must therefore be given plenty of fresh air[138]. The young plants need to be overwintered in a cold frame for the first year and can then be planted out in late spring. It is very important that the pots become neither too dry nor too wet[138]. Division with care when the plants die down after flowering[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
