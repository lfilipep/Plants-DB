0,Dryopteris fragrans,Fragrant Woodfern,Dryopteridaceae,3-7,"Although we have found no reports for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. The fresh plant contains thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]. However, there have been reports for other species of ferns suggesting that even cooked fronds can have a long term harmful effect. Some caution is therefore advised.","Rocks and screes in Arctic Finland[50]. Shaded cliffs and talus, often of limestone at elevations of 50 -1800 metres in northern N. America[270].",N. Europe. N.
