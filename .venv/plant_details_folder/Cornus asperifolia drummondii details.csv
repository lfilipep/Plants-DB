It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

20,Other Uses,"Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Sometimes used in shelterbelt plantings on the plains of N. America[227]. Its spreading underground stems are effective in controlling soil erosion[229].  - heavy, hard, strong, durable, close grained. Used for small wooden articles[82, 149, 227]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. This species is recorded in [200] as only being hardy in zone 9, which means that it is unlikely to succeed outdoors in any but the very mildest areas of the country. Considering the plant's native range, this is almost certainly a mistake[K]. Another report says that the plant withstands extreme cold and very dry spells in its native habitat[229]. This is a fast-growing and relatively long-lived plant in the wild[229]. Flowers are produced in spring on the ends of new growth[229]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78]."
