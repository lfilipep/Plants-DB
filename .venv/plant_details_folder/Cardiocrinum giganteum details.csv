22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist well-drained position in shade and a soil that is rich in leafmould[47, 200]. Requires a deep, very fertile humus-laden soil[233]. Prefers growing in woodland conditions[42, 200]. A monocarpic plant, the bulb takes about 7 years to reach flowering size but then dies after flowering. However, it produces a number of new bulblets at the base and can be propagated by these[47, 200]. These bulblets take 3 - 5 years to flower[200]. The flowers scent the surrounding area with their rich sweet perfume[245]. When planting, only just cover the bulb with leafmould[47]. The bulb is very attractive to slugs, mice and voles and may require protection[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in the autumn. The plant has delayed epigeal germination and will often germinate in the spring but can take up to 2 years especially if the seed is stored prior to being sown[134]. An alternative is to mix the seed with some moist leafmould and seal it in a plastic bag. Keep this at a temperature of 20°c for 3 weeks then pot up any seed that germinates and place the rest in a fridge for 4 - 5 weeks at 3 - 5°c before sowing in a warm place[138]. Seedlings should be grown on in pots in a shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse for 3 - 4 years before planting them out in their permanent positions[138]. Bulblets are obtained from the base of the old plant after flowering. Pot up and plant out when well established.,
