0,Prunus sibirica,Siberian Apricot,Rosaceae,4-8,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Dry sunny slopes amongst shrubs[74].

An edible oil resembling olive oil is obtained from the seed, and used as a substitute for almond flavouring. The fruit is eaten raw or cooked, and is a good size: about 25mm x 25mm (1in), and contains one large seed. The fruit is occasionally eaten but is sour and scarcely edible. The fruit seed is eaten raw or cooked and has a bitter taste. If the seed is too bitter do not eat it. Siberian apricot can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or full sun. The fruit is harvested in early to mid-summer.As a Carbon Farming Solution plant, Siberian apricot is a staple oil crop and an industrial oil crop. Sometimes misspelt as Prunus siberica.","Prunus sibirica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in March, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Armeniaca sibirica.

A bitter taste[11], they are normally used as an almond flavouring[74, 105]. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183] - it is used as an almond flavouring[74]. The oil resembles olive oil[183].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is used in the treatment of coughs, asthma, acute or chronic bronchitis and constipation[176]. The seed contains amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.",A potential rootstock for apricots[113].

Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilThrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil, growing well on limestone[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. This species is reputed to be hardy to about -50°c and as such is of potential use for conferring greater cold tolerance in breeding programmes with the closely related apricot, P. armeniaca. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
