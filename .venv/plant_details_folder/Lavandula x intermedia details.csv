24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen. Succeeds in almost any soil so long as it is well-drained and not too acid[1, 200]. Prefers a sunny position in a neutral to alkaline soil[1, 4, 14]. Prefers a light warm dry soil[37]. When grown in rich soils the plants tend to produce more leaves but less essential oils[4]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Very tolerant of salt wind exposure[K]. When growing for maximum essential oil content, the plant must be given a very warm sunny position and will do best in a light sandy soil, the fragrance being especially pronounced in a chalky soil[245]. Plants are hardy to between -10 and -15°c[184]. Lavender is a very ornamental plant that is often grown in the herb garden and is also grown commercially for its essential oil[1, 4]. This species is a very variable hybrid between the two main species of lavender, L. angustifolia and L. latifolia[200], There are several named varieties[200, 238]. Not a very long-lived plant, it can be trimmed to keep it tidy but is probably best replaced every 10 years[200]. Any trimming is best done in spring and should not be done in the autumn since this can encourage new growth that will not be very cold-hardy[200]. A good bee plant, also attracting butterflies and moths[7, 24, 30]. Lavender makes a good companion for most plants[54], growing especially well with cabbages[14]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[4]. It usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. This species is a hybrid and will not come true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Usually very east, a high percentage will root within a few weeks[78]. Grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings 7cm with a heel succeed at almost any time of the year[1]. Layering.",
