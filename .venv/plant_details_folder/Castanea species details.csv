The four main species groups are commonly known as American (Castanea dentata, Castanea pumila), European (Castanea sativa), Chinese (Castanea mollissima, Castanea henryi, Castanea seguinii ), and Japanese chestnuts (Castanea crenata). Chestnuts should not be confused with horse chestnuts or buckeyes (genus Aesculus), which are not related to Castanea. There are many hybrid varieties including a Chinese-American hybrid close to the original American chestnut [1-1].","Castanea species is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - raw or cooked[183]. Eaten raw, there is a distinct astringency, especially if the fleshy inner skin beneath the outer shell of the seed is not removed[K]. When cooked, however, and especially when baked, the seed becomes much sweeter and has a floury texture[K]. It then makes an excellent food and can be used as a staple food in much the same way as potatoes or cereals[K]. The seed is low in fats and oils but high in carbohydrates[183]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Some see for example the individual entries for Castanea dentata, Castanea mollissima, Castanea pumila",,"The bark, leaves, wood and seed husks all contain tannin. Wood - hard, strong, light. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass, tannin (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Other Systems: woody agriculture.","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Tannin: Occur generally in the roots, wood, bark, leaves, and fruit of many plants. Used in tanning leather, dyeing fabric, making ink, and medical applications.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Other Systems: Woody agriculture: Domesticated woody plants intensively producing agricultural staples.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Tannin  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  New Crop  Other Systems: Woody agriculture  Staple Crop: Balanced carbClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: humid. This record includes a number of garden hybrids involving various species - the origin of each hybrid will be mentioned in the individual cultivar notes. To date, these different hybrids have not been assigned their own specific name. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a good well-drained slightly acid loam but succeeds in dry soils[1, 11, 200]. Once established, it is very drought tolerant[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of highly acid, infertile dry sands[200]. Averse to calcareous soils but succeeds on harder limestones[11, 200]. An excellent soil-enriching understorey in pine forests[200]. Flowers are produced on wood of the current year's growth[229]. Plants are fairly self-sterile[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: standard, coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seed - where possible sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in a seed bed outdoors[78]. The seed must be protected from mice and squirrels. The seed has a short viability and must not be allowed to become dry. It can be stored in a cool place, such as the salad compartment of a fridge, for a few months if it is kept moist, but check regularly for signs of germination. The seed should germinate in late winter or early spring. If sown in an outdoor seedbed, the plants can be left in situ for 1 - 2 years before planting them out in their permanent positions. If grown in pots, the plants can be put out into their permanent positions in the summer or autumn, making sure to give them some protection from the cold in their first winter[K]. These plants are of hybrid origin, so seed is unlikely to breed true[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
