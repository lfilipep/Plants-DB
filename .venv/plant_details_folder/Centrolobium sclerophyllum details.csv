Requires a well-drained soil[ 625 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 625 ]. Young plants have a rapid rate of growth[ 625 ].,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A high germination rate can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 30 days[ 625 ]. Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
