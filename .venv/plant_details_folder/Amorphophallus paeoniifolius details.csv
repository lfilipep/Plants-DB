1,Common Name,"Elephant Yam, Whitespot giant arum"
2,Family,Araceae
3,USDA hardiness,11-12
4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a family where most of the members contain calcium oxalate crystals. This substance is toxic fresh and, if eaten, makes the mouth, tongue and throat feel as if hundreds of small needles are digging in to them. However, calcium oxalate is easily broken down either by thoroughly cooking the plant or by fully drying it and, in either of these states, it is safe to eat the plant. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet[238]."
5,Habitats,"Loose leafy detritus in moist shady habitats[200]. Tropical conditions in secondary forests, shrub forests and grasslands in arid valley areas at elevations below 750 metres[266]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Amorphophallus paeoniifolius is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."
15,Synonyms,A. campanulatus. (Roxb.)Blume.
16,Plant Habitats,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Cultivated Beds;
17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Corm - cooked[2, 4, 103, 105]. Acrid raw[2], it must be thoroughly boiled or baked (see notes above on 'Known Hazards'[K])[46, 61]. A very large root, it can be up to 50cm in diameter[200, 243, 266]. Corms are usually harvested when three years old, at this stage they can weigh up to 9kg[300]. The corms can be stored for several months at 10°c[300]. Some caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity. The fresh corms are turned into curd, or are chopped then dried[472]. The curd is relatively tasteless, but it absorbs flavours well and so can be used as a carbohydrate element in a wide range of other foods[472].Young leaves and petioles - cooked and used as a vegetable[300]. They must be thoroughly cooked[105, 183]. Caution is advised, see notes above on possible toxicity."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Restorative: Restores consciousness or normal physiological activity.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Carminative  Dysentery  Expectorant  Restorative  Stomachic  TonicThe root is carminative, restorative, stomachic and tonic[240, 243]. It is dried and used in the treatment of piles and dysentery[240, 243]. The fresh root acts as an acrid stimulant and expectorant, it is much used in India in the treatment of acute rheumatism[240, 243]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants are often grown as an understorey crop in woodlands or in plantations of betel (Areca spp.), coconuts (Cocos nucifera), bananas (Musa spp.) or coffee (Coffea spp.)[472]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A temperature in the range of 25 - 35°c is required with an annual rainfall of 1,000 - 1,500mm[300]. Corm development is promoted during dry periods[300].The best crops are produced on deep, fertile, alluvial soils that are slightly acid[300]. Dislikes heavy clay soils[300]. Plants require some shade, especially when young[300]. Members of this genus generally require a moist but well-drained, humus-rich, fertile soil and a position in dappled shade[472].The plants are usually grown on a three year cycle[300]. An interesting technique used in Indonesia is to dig up the tuber after one year and then replant it upside down. This stimulates the lateral buds into growth and increases the overall size of the tuber[472].Yields of 20 tonnes per hectare can be achieved[300].There are many cultivated forms, some of which have a lower content of calcium oxalate crystals and less or no alkaloids[472].The plant produces one or two enormous leaves and one short flowering stem annually. When ripe for pollination, the flowers have a foetid smell to attract carrion flies and midges. This smell disappears once the flowers have been pollinated[245].Like many species in the family Araceae, this plant has the ability to heat the flowering spadix as the pollen becomes ready for fertilization. This heat greatly increases the strength of the aroma released by the plant, thus attracting more pollinating insects. It can also have the effect of making the insects more active, thus increasing the level of fertilization[472]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a pot in a warm greenhouse as soon as it is ripe and the pot sealed in a plastic bag to retain moisture. It usually germinates in 1 - 8 months at 24°c[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least a couple of years. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away strongly."
