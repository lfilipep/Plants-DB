0,Sambucus javanica,Chinese Elder,Caprifoliaceae,Coming soon,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves and stems of some, if not all, members of this genus are poisonous[9, 76]. The fruit of many species (although no records have been seen for this species) has been known to cause stomach upsets to some people. Any toxin the fruit might contain is liable to be of very low toxicity and is destroyed when the fruit is cooked[65, 76].",Wild areas on village outskirts and wasteland[147].,E. Asia - China.,(1 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Sambucus javanica is a deciduous Shrub. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[183]. The fruit is small but is borne in large clusters and is thus easy to harvest. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Flowers - raw or cooked. Leaves and young stems - cooked[183]. It is probably unwise to eat the leaves, see the notes above on toxicity. Root - cooked[183]. Is it poisonous?","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiphlogistic  Depurative  Diuretic  Purgative  SkinThe leaves and the root are used in the treatment of pain and numbness, bone diseases and rheumatic problems[147, 218]. The fruit is depurative and purgative[218]. A decoction of the fruit is used to treat injuries, skin diseases and swellings[147, 218]. A decoction of the whole plant is anodyne, depurative and diuretic[147, 218, 240]",,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it is only likely to be hardy outdoors in the mildest areas of the country. There is some confusion over the true identity of this plant. Some authorities suggest that this name is a synonym of S. chinensis, and we also have two different authors for the name of this species, the name mentioned above, from [147], and also Blume, which is mentioned in [146]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Tolerates most soils, including chalk[200], but prefers a moist loamy soil[1, 200]. Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position[1]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with a heel, late autumn in a frame or a sheltered outdoor bed[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
