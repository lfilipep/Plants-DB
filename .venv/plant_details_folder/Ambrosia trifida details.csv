19,Edible Uses Description,"s plant was cultivated by the pre-Columbian N. American Indians, seeds found in pre-historic sites are 4 - 5 times larger than those of the present-day wild plant, which seems to indicate selective breeding by the Indians[207]. The following report is for A. artemesifolia, it quite possibly also applies to this species[K]. An oil is obtained from the seed. It has been suggested for edible purposes because it contains little linolenic acid[61, 183]. The seed contains up to 19% oil[61], it has slightly better drying properties than soya bean oil[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Astringent  Emetic  Poultice  Skin  Women's complaintsThe leaves are very astringent, emetic and febrifuge[222, 257]. They are applied externally to insect bites and various skin complaints, internally they are used as a tea in the treatment of pneumonia, fevers, nausea, intestinal cramps, diarrhoea and mucous discharges[222]. The juice of wilted leaves is disinfectant and is applied to infected toes[257]. A tea made from the roots is used in the treatment of menstrual disorders and stroke[222]. The pollen is harvested commercially and manufactured into pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of allergies to the plant[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses."
23,Other Uses Description,"A red colour is obtained from the crushed heads[207]. (This probably refers to the seed heads[K].) The sap of the plant can stain the skin red[274]. A positive impact may be seen with a noted decrease in the numbers of plant-parasitic nematodes found in soyabean fields where A. trifida is present (Wang et al., 1998)."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species but suggest growing it in a sunny position in a well-drained soil[K]. This plant is sometimes cultivated by the N. American Indians for food and medicine[207].  Special Features:North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in situ in April.
