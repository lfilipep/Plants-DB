The leaves have a very mild flavour and a slightly mucilaginous texture, they make an excellent ingredient of mixed salads and can be eaten in quantity[K]. The leaves can be available all year round from successional sowings, and will only need protection in colder winters[K]. When grown in rich soils larger leaves are produced that can be used as a potherb[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a fairly rich light soil[1]. Prefers a sunny position but tolerates some shade in summer[K]. This shade, plus an adequate supply of water, will slow down the plant's tendency to run to seed[200]. Late sowings will benefit from a sheltered sunny position and perhaps some protection in the winter. Occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves, there are some named varieties[183]. It is less hardy than common corn salad (Valerianella locusta), but does not run to seed so quickly in hot weather[183].","Seed - in order to obtain a continuous supply of salad leaves, it is best to sow the seed successionally from early spring to mid summer in situ. A late summer sowing can also succeed, and this would supply edible leaves in the winter.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
