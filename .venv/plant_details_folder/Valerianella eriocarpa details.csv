18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves - raw or cooked[2, 37, 52]. The leaves have a very mild flavour and a slightly mucilaginous texture, they make an excellent ingredient of mixed salads and can be eaten in quantity[K]. The leaves can be available all year round from successional sowings, and will only need protection in colder winters[K]. When grown in rich soils larger leaves are produced that can be used as a potherb[183]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a fairly rich light soil[1]. Prefers a sunny position but tolerates some shade in summer[K]. This shade, plus an adequate supply of water, will slow down the plant's tendency to run to seed[200]. Late sowings will benefit from a sheltered sunny position and perhaps some protection in the winter. Occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves, there are some named varieties[183]. It is less hardy than common corn salad (Valerianella locusta), but does not run to seed so quickly in hot weather[183]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - in order to obtain a continuous supply of salad leaves, it is best to sow the seed successionally from early spring to mid summer in situ. A late summer sowing can also succeed, and this would supply edible leaves in the winter."
