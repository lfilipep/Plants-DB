See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It can grow in water.",Z. caducifolia.,Pond;,"Flowers: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"The swollen stem bases, infected with the smut fungus Ustilago esculenta, are eaten as a vegetable by the Chinese[1, 74, 105]. They must be harvested before the fungus starts to produce spores since the flesh deteriorates at this time[206]. They are parboiled then sautéed with other vegetables and have a nutty flavour reminiscent of coconut[183]. The wild forms of this species have developed resistance to the smut, so specially disease-susceptible cultivars are grown[206]. Seed - cooked[1, 74, 136]. It can be used like rice in sweet or savoury dishes[183]. The seed can also be ground into a flour and used in making cakes, biscuits etc[K]. The seed contains about 13.7% protein, 0.9% fat, 72.7% carbohydrate, 0.7% ash[179]. Young inflorescences - cooked and used as a vegetable[183]. Young shoots - raw or cooked[46, 136, 178]. A pleasant sweet taste[74]. The shoots contain about 1% protein, 0.3% fat, 4.7% carbohydrate, 0.7% ash[179]. Root[1, 74].

Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Febrifuge  TonicThe shoots, roots and the seed are diuretic and febrifuge[178, 218]. The leaves are tonic[218].","Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","The leaves are woven into mats[1, 46, 61].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA marsh or water plant requiring shallow stagnant or slowly flowing water, it is easily grown in most soils in a sunny position[136]. Prefers a slightly acidic clay-loam soil[206]. One report suggests that the plant is in hardiness zone 9 (only tolerating light frosts)[200] but this is rather questionable, there are several reports of the plant being perfectly hardy in Britain, though it does not usually flower in this country[136]. It requires hot summers with temperatures between 20 - 30°c if it is to do well[206]. It is often cultivated as a food crop in E. Asia and is often grown as cover for wild fowl along the sides of lakes in Britain[136]. It grows very well at Kew[136].","Seed - it must not be allowed to dry out or it will quickly lose its viability, usually within 4 weeks[136]. Store collected seed in jars of water in a cool place such as the salad compartment of a fridge. Sow the seed in a greenhouse in spring. Immerse the pots so that they are covered by about 5cm of water. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
