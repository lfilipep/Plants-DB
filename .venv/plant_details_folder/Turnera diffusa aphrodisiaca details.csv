24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a dry soil in a warm sunny sheltered position[238]. One report says that this species is hardy to about -5°c[238], though this needs to be treated with some caution considering its native range is entirely tropical[K]. It is possible that, whilst the plant will be cut back to the ground by cold weather, the rootstock is hardier and will re-sprout in the spring[K]. It will certainly be worthwhile trying the plant outdoors and giving the roots a thick protective mulch in the autumn[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[238]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from winter cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Division in spring or autumn[238]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse and plant them out in early summer."
