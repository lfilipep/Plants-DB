19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiemetic  Cardiac  Cathartic  Diuretic  Emetic  Emmenagogue  Hypotensive  Irritant  Narcotic  Parasiticide  PurgativeThe root is anthelmintic, cardiac, cathartic, diuretic, emetic, emmenagogue, irritant, violently narcotic and a drastic purgative[4, 9, 21, 46]. The dried root is used, it contains the alkaloids nervine, pseudo-nervine and veratridine[213]. It is best to harvest the root in the autumn[213]. The plant is useful for reducing blood pressure in various conditions of hypertension[213]."
20,Other Uses,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.
21,Other Uses Description,"A decoction of the roots is used as a parasiticide against body lice, fleas etc[76, 213]. This use is somewhat dangerous, see the notes above on toxicity. Plants are suitable for ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Cultivation of this plant is not always easy, it prefers a rich limy soil in partial shade[187]. One report says that the plant requires an alkaline soil[17]. Succeeds in any good garden soil[1], preferring a moist well-drained rich loam in a sheltered position in partial shade[1, 4, 31, 111]. Succeeds when grown in the shade of a north-facing wall[233]. Does not object to lime[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[200]. Dislikes drought. Slugs are very fond of this plant and it will probably require some protection from them[187]. The various species in this genus hybridize freely[95]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their permanent positions whilst still small[200]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1, 134]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible[1], it usually germinates in the autumn to spring. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This species produces flowering plants in 2 - 3 years from seed[200]. Division after flowering or in autumn. Take care since the plant resents disturbance[111, 200]."
