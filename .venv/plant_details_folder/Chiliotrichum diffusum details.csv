22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sheltered position in any well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[11, 200]. Tolerates dry soils[200]. A good plant for maritime gardens[260]. Succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of Britain but it is not very hardy in other parts of the country[11, 166, 200]. However, it is more cold tolerant than the closely related Olearia spp and can withstand temperatures down to about -5°c or lower when in a suitable position[11, 200]. Another report says that it will tolerate temperatures down to about -12°c[260]. A very variable species, the leaves can range from needle-like to fairly broad[166]. There are several named forms[166].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but would suggest surface sowing the seed in early spring in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame.",
