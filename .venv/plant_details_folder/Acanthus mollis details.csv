0,Acanthus mollis,Bear's Breeches,Acanthaceae,Coming soon,None known,Woodland scrub and stony hillsides[45].,South-western Europe - Portugal to the Balkans. Naturalized in Britain in W. Cornwall[17].,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AcanthusMollis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AcanthusMollis2.jpg",,"Acanthus mollis is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in).  It is in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",A. latifolius.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; Meadow;,,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Historic Staple: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Other Systems: FMAFS: Farmer-Managed Agroforestry Farming Systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Detergent: A cleansing agent, used on wounds etc. It removes dead and diseased matter.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Detergent  Emollient  Urinary  VulneraryThe leaves and roots are astringent, detergent, emollient and vulnerary[7, 61, 254]. The plant contains appreciable quantities of mucilage and tannin. Traditionally it was used as a treatment for dislocated joints and for burns. A paste made from the plant, when applied to a dislocated joint, tends to normalize the affected muscles and ligaments, simultaneously relaxing and tightening them to encourage the joint back into its proper place[254]. The crushed leaves have been used as a poultice to soothe burns and scalds[268]. For internal use, the plant's emollient properties are useful in treating irritated mucous membranes within the digestive and urinary tracts[254].",,The sub-species A. mollis latifolia makes a good ground cover plant[208]. Relatively slow to cover the ground at first but it can eventually become invasive[197].,,"Prefers a deep loamy soil in a sheltered position in full sun[1] but tolerates partial shade[31, 111]. Grows well in heavy clay soils if they are well-drained but dislikes heavy damp soils[111] and will not overwinter in wet soils[200]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190]. Hardy to about -15°c[187], though young plants may require protection in the winter[190] and even older ones may need protection in cold winters[111]. A very ornamental plant[1]. The leaves can wilt on hot summer days when plants are grown in full sun[190]. Plants can become invasive[197], spreading by suckers, and they are difficult to eradicate due to their deep roots[190]. Does well in the lawn or wild garden[111]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut in the autumn[233]. Members of this genus are not usually browsed by deer[233].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[133, 200] or outside as soon as the seed is ripe[133]. It usually germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 10°c[133]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for two years before planting out in late spring or early summer[200, K]. Division in spring or autumn[111, 200]. Very easy, they can be planted straight out into their permanent positions. Root cuttings - winter in a coldframe[111, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
