24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. It is closely related to R. arcticus, and is included in that species by some botanists[235]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].,
