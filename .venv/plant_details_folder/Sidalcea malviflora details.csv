24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep fertile well-drained but moisture-retentive soil in full sun or with some shade at the hottest part of the day[200]. This species thrives in climates with a relatively cool summer and mild winters and tolerates temperatures down to about -15°c[200]. However, where prolonged cold temperatures are experienced without snow cover, it is best to mulch the plants well in winter with material such as bracken litter[200]. If the plants are cut back immediately after flowering they will usually produce a second flush of bloom in late summer[200]. The flowers last well when they are cut for indoor use[200]. There are many named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in the spring.",
