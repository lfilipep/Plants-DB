See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw, roasted, fried or ground into a powder[63 , 418 ]. The seeds have a pleasant flavour resembling hazel nuts. After removal of the leathery testa, the kernels can be eaten raw, roasted, fried or ground for a drink or sweets[324 , 418 ]. Under dry conditions nuts will keep for around 30 days in the capsule; shell damage or a moist environment can initiate enzyme reaction leading to acidification and rancidity of the oil[324 ]. The nuts are easily separated from the thin shell and, when dried and roasted, they can be safely stored for a long time in sealed plastic bags The seed is about 25mm long and is surrounded by a thin shell that can easily be broken with the fingers[63 ]. The seeds are a source of an edible oil rich in linoleic acid (34.4%)[324 , 418 ]. Once extracted the oil can be safely stored for a long time without turning rancid[324 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Nuts and oil are an excellent cure for pulmonary complaints and dermatitis[324 ].,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","Agroforestry Uses: The tree is grown to provide shade tree in coffee and cacao plantations[418 ] Other Uses The oil extracted from the shells and seeds is used as an illuminant[324 , 418 ]. A latex obtained from the bark is used as an illuminant[324 ]. The wood is not regarded as valuable or durable. It is used for furniture[324 , 418 ]. The wood is used to make an excellent charcoal[324 , 418 ].","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Experimental Crop  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein-oilA plant of the semi-arid to moist tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,300 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 29c, but can tolerate 12 - 35c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 800 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a position in full sun[324 ]. Succeeds on a wide range of soils[324 ]. Tolerates a few months of mild drought and withstands brief waterlogging[324 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 6.5[418 ]. Plant growth is rapid, with fruiting usually beginning in the seventh year when trees are around 7 metres tall[324 , 418 ]. Occasional plants will commence fruiting when as young as 4 - 5 years old[324 ]. The average weight of a nut is 8.5 g, attaining 12.5 g or more in superior selections[324 ]. A 10 year old tree can yield 100 - 250 kg of nuts per annum, an old specimen has given about 800 kg[324 ]. There is the potential for an annual production of 3,500 - 5,000 kg of oil per ha from trees bearing nuts with an oil content of 57%[324 ]. Both monoecious and dioecious trees have been reported[324 ] - it is important to make sure you are either growing monoecious forms, or have both male and female dioecious forms if seed is required.","Seed - it has a short viability and so should preferably be sown within 10 days of harvesting[324 ]. It is reputed to fail to germinate if more than 35 days old[324 ]. Shade is required during the first year of growth, followed by full exposure to the sun on transplanting when around 50 cm high at the onset of the following rainy season[324 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
