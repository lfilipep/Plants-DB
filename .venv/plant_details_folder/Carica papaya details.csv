13,Summary,"Papaya or Carica papaya otherwise known as Mam'o or Melon Tree is one of the most popular trees cultivated for its tropical fruits. It grows up to 10 m tall with a non-woody, hollow bole of up to 30 cm in diameter. The fruit is consumed raw or cooked. It can be eaten fresh when ripe or as vegetable (immature fruits), processed, preserved, or dried. The seeds are used as spice; the male flowers and young leaves are also edible when cooked. Papaya is also valued for its medicinal uses. It is a source of the enzyme papain which is a digestive stimulant, and can be used in wounds. The fruit is used to treat diabetes, hypertension, warts, diarrhoea, high blood pressure, and painful womb. The leaves are applied externally to wounds to aid in the healing process. It is cooked and used against malaria, irregular bowel movement in children, and threadworms and roundworms. Latex obtained from the trunk is used in wounds as well, and in gums to relieve toothache. Young leaves are used as mulch.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Carica papaya is an evergreen Tree growing to 8 m (26ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender.

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antidiarrhoeal  Aphrodisiac  Appetizer  Astringent  Cancer  Digestive  Dysentery  Hypotensive  Kidney  Laxative  Malaria  Parasiticide  Purgative  Skin  VermifugeThe skin of the unripe fruit, the leaves, sap and seeds of the papaya are all a source of the enzyme papain, a digestive stimulant that facilitates the digestion of protein[ 200 , 238 ]. The unripe fruit is an especially good source[ 254 ]. Papain can be used internally, especially in the form of the extracted enzyme, to treat digestive disorders[ 238 ]. It is also applied externally to aid the healing of deep or slow-healing wounds[ 238 ]. An infusion of the young, latex-filled, green fruit is used as a children's vermifuge[ 348 ]. The juice of the fruit is used to treat diabetes and hypertension[ 348 ]. The immature fruit, sometimes combined with aspirin, is used as an abortifacient[ 348 ]. The fruit pulp is mixed with fat in a pomade to remedy abscesses[ 348 ]; The juice of the fruit is used to dissolve warts[ 348 ]. The leaves and the fruit, especially the unripe fruit, are taken internally in the treatment of a range of digestive disorders, diarrhoea, high blood pressure and painful womb[ 254 , 348 ]. The green leaves are cooked as a treatment for tertiary malaria and for irregular bowel movement in children[ 348 ]. Externally, the leaves are applied to wounds as a dressing that helps to speed the healing process[ 254 ]. The leaves and seeds are used locally to rid the body of threadworms and roundworms[ 238 ]. The seeds are used as a gentle purgative to rid the body of worms[ 254 ]. Immature seeds are swallowed to treat diarrhoea[ 311 ]. The seed is eaten as a children's vermifuge, and also to increase visual acuity[ 348 ]. The latex from the trunk of the tree has a strong purgative action when taken internally and is sometimes used to rid the body of worms[ 254 ]. The latex is applied externally to wounds, boils, ulcers, warts and cancerous tumours in order to speed their healing[ 254 ]. It is also applied to the gums to treat toothache[ 348 ]. The ripe fruit is a mild laxative[ 254 ]. A decoction of the ripe fruit is used to treat persistent diarrhoea and dysentery in children[ 254 ]. An infusion of the flowers is drunk in order to induce menstruation, and also to treat laryngitis, bronchitis and venereal diseases[ 254 , 348 ]. The flowers are used in combination with milk and butter as an appetite stimulant[ 348 ]. The bark is used to treat diarrhoea[ 348 ]. The inner bark is used to treat toothache[ 311 ]. The root is aphrodisiac, astringent and vermifuge[ 348 ]. The macerated root is used in the treatment of gonorrhoea[ 348 ]. An infusion of the root in alcohol is used to treat bladder and kidney problems[ 348 ]. A decoction is drunk to treat abdominal stricture, diarrhoea, malaria and intestinal worms[ 348 ]. Applied externally, an infusion of the root in alcohol is rubbed on the limbs to treat rickets[ 348 ]. A decoction of the root is used externally to treat abdominal stricture[ 348 ]. The latex contains the protein-degrading (proteolytic) and mucolytic enzymes papain and chymopapain[ 348 ]. The plant contains hydrocyanic acid, carpaine, terpene hydrocarbons, terpene alcohols, cyanogenic glycosides[ 348 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: Young leaves are used as mulch[ 418 ]. Other Uses The dried leaves can be beaten in water to form a soap substitute[ 298 ]. Papain, found in its greatest concentration in the latex in the skin of unripe fruits, has a multitude of uses. It is added to cosmetic skin creams, termite control, used in clarifying beer, degumming natural silk etc[ 200 , 418 ]. A fibre obtained from the plant can be up to 150cm long, but it is of questionable utility[ 454 ]. The whitish or pale yellow wood is very soft, very lightweight, and fleshy. There is a large white pith, and the centre of the trunk is hollow except at nodes. The wood is not used[ 447 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Papaya succeeds in tropical and subtropical areas, where it can be found between 32°N and S. It produces best at elevations below 900 metres, though it can also succeed as high as 2,100 metres near the equator[ 335 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 21 - 30°c, but can tolerate 12 - 44°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of -1°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a climate with well distributed rainfall and a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,500mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 3,000mm[ 200 , 335 , 418 ]. Low temperatures cause smaller fruit size and low quality. Prefers a sunny position in a deep, humus- rich soil[ 296 ]. Requires a well-drained, well-aerated soil, trees can die within a few days if the soil becomes waterlogged[ 200 ]. Grows best in a position sheltered from strong winds[ 200 ]. Plants produce masses of easily damaged feeding roots near the surface and so are best hand weeded when young and given a good organic mulch as they grow[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 8[ 418 ]. A very productive plant, it can start to crop when only 6 months old and can produce fruit all year round[ 296 ]. Yields of between 22 - 56 tonnes/ha of fresh fruit are obtained in Hawaii and yields up to 80 tones/ha have been reported. The yields are highest in the second and third year and they then decline rapidly[ 418 ]. The productive life of a tree is very short, yields have declined sharply by the time it is four years old[ 418 ]. There are many named varieties[ 46 , 200 , 296 ]. Individual plants can bear only male flowers, only female flowers or hermaphrodite flowers. One male plant will be enough to fertilize 6 or more females[ 296 ]. Hand pollinated fruits ripen after about 150 - 240 days[ 418 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a position in indirect light. Germination takes 2 - 6 weeks at 24 - 30°c[ 200 ]. Move to a sunny position about 2 weeks after germination. Greenwood cuttings. Grafting.,
