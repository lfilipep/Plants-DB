24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will succeed in Britain. This species does not appear in the 'Flora of New Zealand and there must be some doubts over the validity of its name[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. This species is nt in the IOPI list of accepted plant names. Succeeds in most soils in a sunny position.
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but it would probably succeed from an outdoor sowing in mid spring in situ. Only just cover the seed. If you only have a small quantity of seed then it would be safer to sow this in a cold frame in the winter. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. Division in spring."
