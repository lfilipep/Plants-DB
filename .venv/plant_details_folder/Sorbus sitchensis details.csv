4,Known Hazards,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Sorbus sitchensis is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.8 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked in pies, preserves etc[62, 105, 161, 183]. Of poor quality[256]. The fruit turns sweeter and so tastes best after a frost[101]. The fruit is produced in clusters, each fruit being about 6 - 12mm in diameter[229].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Enuresis: Treats bed wetting.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Enuresis  Kidney  Parasiticide  StomachicAn infusion of the branches has been given to young children with bed-wetting problems[257]. An infusion of the root and branch bark has been drunk in the treatment of stomach problems and rheumatism[257]. The infusion can also be used externally as a bath for treating rheumatism[257]. A decoction of the root and branch bark has been used as an eyewash[257]. The bark has been chewed in the treatment of colds[257]. An infusion of the branches has been used in the treatment of weak kidneys in order to stop the frequent urination[257].,
22,Other Uses,"Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"This species is capable of growing in exposed conditions in poor soils[229], and so could be used in re-afforestation as a pioneer plant to provide suitable conditions for other woodland trees to be established[K]. It is rather slow-growing, however, and would only be used in situations where faster species were not so suitable[K]. The berries have been rubbed onto the scalp in order to get rid of lice[257].  - moderately light with little strength, it is of no commercial value[229].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most reasonably good soils in an open sunny position[11]. Dislikes dry soils[188]. Tolerates light shade[188], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. This species is able to succeed in poor soils and to become established on exposed broken ground[229], it is thus suitable for use as a pioneer species in re-establishing woodland[K]. A slow-growing shrub in the wild, it can sometimes become a small tree up to 9 metres tall[229]. It usually produces abundant crops of fruit every year[229]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring.",
