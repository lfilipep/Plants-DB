24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[3, 11, 166, 200] but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. Prefers a soil that is dry in the summer[184]. Plants are not very wind-firm[11]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[184]. This species was growing well at Chelsea Physic garden after the harsh winter of 1985/86, showing no signs of damage[11]. Highly fire resistant[155], it can regenerate after a forest fire from a mallee-like base[166, 184]. Plants self-layer in nature[155]. A very ornamental plant[1], it grows well in Britain[3]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. The cuttings are very slow and can take a year to root[1, 78]. This species is very difficult from cuttings[166]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200].",
