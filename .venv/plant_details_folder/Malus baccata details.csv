0,Malus baccata,"Chinese Crab, Siberian crab apple",Rosaceae,2-7,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Open forested areas to elevations of 1800 - 3600 metres[51, 272].",E. Asia - N.

Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Spreading or horizontal.","Malus baccata is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Pyrus baccata.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[46, 105]. Fruit from the typical species is about 1cm in diameter, though there are sub-species and cultivated forms with considerably larger fruits[200]. A sour taste, but the fruit is palatable[2, K]. It is often dried for winter use[61] and also makes an excellent jelly[183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AnodyneA paste of the fruit is applied to the forehead to relieve headaches[272].,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,The plant can be used as a rootstock for apple cultivars. It produces a vigorous tree that has more cold tolerance and disease resistance[183]. It is commonly used as stock to graft Malus pumila and M. asiatica in N and NE China[266]. The sub-species M. baccata himalaica is more often used for this purpose. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Espalier, Pest tolerant, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils including heavy ones[1, 98], preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[200]. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -40°c[160]. The plants are very resistant to disease[34]. This species is cultivated for its edible fruit in China, there are several named varieties[22]. The sub-species M. baccata mandschurica. (Maxim.)Schneid. has slightly larger fruits which ripen earlier than the type[1, 200]. Trees can produce fruit in 4 years from seed[160]. A very ornamental tree[1], the fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year.
