Dislikes water-logged soils[200], it is liable to die out in heavy soils over winter[111]. Requires an open sunny position[188]. This species is not reliably hardy in cool temperate zones[200]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a cold frame or May outdoors[111]. Keep moist and in a shady position until germination takes place[175]. The seed has a limited viability so it should be stored in a sealed container at about 3°c[200]. Temperatures above 15°c inhibit germination[175]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 9 weeks at 15°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Cuttings of basal shoots in April/May, taken before they become hollow at the base, and planted in a cold frame[111]. Division in spring[111] or early autumn[200].",
