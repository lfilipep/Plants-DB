26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seedlings are subject to damping off[1] so water with care and make sure to give adequate ventilation. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",
