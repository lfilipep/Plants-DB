See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Convolvulus sepium.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedgerow;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",,"Stalks and root - cooked[2, 46, 128, 153]. Washed and steamed[179]. A pleasant sweet taste[178]. Rich in starch and sugars, it is very nutritious[179]. It should not be eaten regularly, however, due to its possible purgative effect[179]. Young shoots - cooked[46, 61, 105]. Some caution is advised since they are possibly purgative[179].","Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants for ropes may be included.,The stems are very flexible and can be used as an emergency string for tying[6]. It is fairly strong but not very long-lasting[K].,,"Easily grown in ordinary garden soil in a sunny position, but plants are apt to become invasive[1, 200]. Hedge bindweed is a troublesome garden weed, especially when growing on moist soils[1, 4]. The plant is a vigorous climber with annual shoots 3 metres or more long. These twine around other plants and can kill them by smothering them[4]. Once established, it is very difficult to eradicate the plant because it has very deep roots and is capable of re-growing from any part of the root left in the ground. The flowers open in sunny weather and remain closed during dull weather[4]. Nearly all taxa in Calystegia intergrade geographically into neighboring taxa with the exception of the widespread coastal species, C. soldanella (Linnaeus) R. Brown. It is impossible to draw clearly defined specific limits, and intermediate forms are always found where two taxa approximate geographically[266].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame in a free draining compost and only just cover. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring whilst dormant[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
