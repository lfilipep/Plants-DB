Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antiinflammatory  Expectorant  StomachicThe fruit and the spines contain a number of medically active constituents including saponins and flavonoids[279]. They are anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and expectorant, and have shown anti-HIV activity[279]. They are used in Korea in the treatment of coughs, constipation and liver diseases[279]. They should not be used by pregnant women since they have a stimulant effect upon the uterus and could induce a miscarriage[279]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. This species is not recognised as distinct in the International Lgume Database and is more geerally viewed as a sub-species of G. japonica[279]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in a loamy soil, requiring a sunny position[11]. Succeeds in most soils[200]. Tolerates drought once established[1] and atmospheric pollution[200]. Trees have a light canopy, they come into leaf late in the spring and drop their leaves in early autumn[200] making them an excellent top storey tree in a woodland garden. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in a greenhouse[78]. The seed should have swollen up, in which case it can be sown, if it has not swollen then soak it for another 24 hours in warm water. If this does not work then file away some of the seed coat but be careful not to damage the embryo[78]. Further soaking should then cause the seed to swell. One it has swollen, the seed should germinate within 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual deep pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors."
