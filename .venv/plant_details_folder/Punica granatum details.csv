18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[1, 2, 3, 4]. Juicy and refreshing with a sub-acid flavour[183], they are considered delicious by many people though others do not like the large number of seeds with relatively little fruit pulp[K]. The fruit juice can be used in soups, sauces, jellies, ice cream, cakes etc[183]. The fruit contains about 1.5% protein, 1.6% fat, 16.8% carbohydrate, 0.6% ash[149, 179]. Annual yields from wild trees in the Himalayas averaged 32kg per tree[194]. The fruit is about 12cm in diameter[200]. The fresh seed is soft and can be eaten raw[227]. When dried it is used as a seasoning in dal, fried samosa, stuffings and chutneys[183]. The boiled leaves are said to be eaten[183].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antiviral  Astringent  Cardiac  Demulcent  Dysentery  Emmenagogue  Refrigerant  Stomachic  VermifugeThe pomegranate has a long history of herbal use dating back more than 3,000 years[238]. All parts of the plant contain unusual alkaloids, known as 'pelletierines', which paralyse tapeworms so that they are easily expelled from the body by using a laxative[238]. The plant is also rich in tannin, which makes it an effective astringent. It is used externally in the treatment of vaginal discharges, mouth sores and throat infections[238].The whole plant, but in particular the bark, is antibacterial, antiviral and astringent[21, 46, 57, 89, 176, 194]. This remedy should be used with caution, overdoses can be toxic[21, 218].The flowers are used in the treatment of dysentery, stomach ache and cough[218]. Along with the leaves and seeds, they have been used to remove worms[4]. The juice of the flowers is used to treat nose bleeds[311].The seeds are demulcent and stomachic[4, 240]. A decoction of the seed is used to treat syphilis[311].The fruit is a mild astringent and refrigerant in some fevers and especially in biliousness[4]. It is also cardiac and stomachic[240]. The juice of the fruit is used to treat jaundice and diarrhoea[311]. Combined with the juice of Cynodon dactylon leaves, it is used for treating runny noses and colds[311].The dried rind of the fruit is used in the treatment of amoebic dysentery, diarrhoea etc[4, 238]. It is a specific remedy for tapeworm infestation[254]. The rind of the fruit is ground in water and drunk every morning by diabetics[311].The stem bark is emmenagogue[218]. Both the stem and the root barks are used to expel tapeworms[4]. Use this with caution, the root bark can cause serious poisoning[7]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238].The dried pericarp is decocted with other herbs and used in the treatment of colic, dysentery, leucorrhoea etc[218].An ethyl alcohol extract of the fruit has shown interesting oestrogenic properties. In addition, it has been shown to reduce cell death from oxidation. The plant has potential as an active ingredient in preparations for the treatment of skin-ageing in post-menopausal women[1574].",

23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Espalier, Foundation, , Massing, Superior hedge. Special Features: Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. Agroforestry Uses:A deep rooting tree, it is important in soil erosion control, and is planted along rivers to stabilize banks[303].A drought-tolerant tree, it is suitable for arid and semi-arid zone reforestation[303].The leaf litter decomposes slowly and is suitable for mulching[303].The plant is also used in water purification schemes[303].Plants are grown as hedges in Mediterranean climates[200]. Their wind firm stature makes them a good wind break[303]. They are also sometimes used for fencing[303].The plant is traditionally grown in living fences in the northwestern Himalayas, where it helps to exclude livestock and other animals; mark out land boundaries; whilst also providing a range of medicinal and other uses[1174]. Other Uses: A red dye is obtained from the flowers and also from the rind of unripened fruits[89, 100, 158, 168]. The dye can be red or black and it is also used as an ink[149]. It is coppery-brown in colour[168]. No mordant is required[168]. A fast yellow dye is obtained from the dried rind[194]. The dried peel of the fruit contains about 26% tannin[46, 223]. The bark can also be used as a source of tannin[146]. The root bark contains about 22% tannin, a jet-black ink can be made from it[194]. Plants are grown as hedges in Mediterranean climates[200].  - very hard, compact, close-grained, durable, yellow. Used for making agricultural implements. A possible substitute for box, Buxus spp[146, 149, 158, 194].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a well-drained fertile soil[1, 182, 260] and succeeds in a hot dry position[166]. Requires a sheltered sunny position[219]. Not very hardy in Britain, the pomegranate tolerates temperatures down to about -11°c[3], but it is best grown on a south facing wall even in the south of the country because it requires higher summer temperatures than are normally experienced in this country in order to ripen its fruit and its wood[11, 166]. The wood is also liable to be cut back by winter frosts when it is grown away from the protection of a wall[11]. Trees do not grow so well in the damper western part of Britain[182]. Most plants of this species grown in Britain are of the dwarf cultivar 'Nana'. This is hardier than the type but its fruit is not such good quality[11]. This sub-species fruited on an east-facing wall at Kew in the hot summer of 1989[K]. The pomegranate is often cultivated in warm temperate zones for its edible fruit, there are many named varieties[183]. In Britain fruits are only produced after very hot summers. Plants often sucker freely[7]. Flowers are produced on the tips of the current years growth[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1]. Heat zone: 12-7. Espalier: tree or other plant that is trained to grow flat against a support (such as a trellis or wall).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse, preferably at a temperature of 22°c[200, 238]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first 2 growing seasons. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 4 - 5cm with a heel, June/July in a frame[78, 113]. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 20 - 25cm long, November in a warm greenhouse[113]. Layering. Division of suckers in the dormant season[200]. They can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we prefer to pot them up first and plant them out when they are growing away well in late spring or early summer.",
