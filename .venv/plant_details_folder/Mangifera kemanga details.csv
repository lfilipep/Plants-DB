Presumably grafting on seedling stock would be possible, in particular through inarching potted, decapitated rootstocks into twigs of mother trees. Grafting on Mangifera indica L. has been attempted without success, probably because this species is not closely related[303 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
