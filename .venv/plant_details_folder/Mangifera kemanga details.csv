18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit. The very juicy, very fibrous, copious white pulp has a strong flavour that some find agreeable and others offensive[894 ]. Kemang fruit is eaten fresh when ripe, or used for home-made juice. It is used unripe to make 'rujak', a dish of sliced green fruit covered with a spicy sauce. A drink make from the juice with sugar, ice and a pinch of coffee powder is highly esteemed[894 ]. The yellowish-brown fruit is pear-shaped, containing a single, large seed[894 ]. Young leaves - raw or cooked. They are commonly eaten in 'lalab', a dish of fresh leafy vegetables to accompany rice[303 , 894 ]. Occasionally a dish is made from fresh, grated seeds, with fermented soya beans and spices[303 ]. The grated seed has been used to prepare the sambal kemang, with the addition of chili and salt[894 ].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the wet, tropical lowlands, where it is usually found at elevations below 400 metres, but rarely up to 800 metres[303 ]. It requires a rainfall which is evenly distributed through the year[303 ]. The plant stands inundation well and is commonly cultivated on periodically inundated riverbanks in East Kalimantan[303 ]. Mature trees require much space, 12 - 16 metres each way being typical[303 ]. Natural hybrids between Mangifera kemanga and Mangifera caesia, showing intermediate characteristics, are found in orchards in East Kalimantan[303 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - It is propagated from seed, an indication that the agronomy of the crops has received little attention. Presumably grafting on seedling stock would be possible, in particular through inarching potted, decapitated rootstocks into twigs of mother trees. Grafting on Mangifera indica L. has been attempted without success, probably because this species is not closely related[303 ].",
