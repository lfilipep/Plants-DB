17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[1, 50, 61, 177]. The seed ripens in the latter half of summer and, when harvested and dried, can store for several years. It has a floury texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour. It can be used as a staple food crop in either savoury or sweet dishes. The seed can be cooked whole, though it is more commonly ground into a flour and used as a cereal in all the ways that oats are used, especially as a porridge but also to make biscuits, sourdough bread etc. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw or cooked in salads, stews etc. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The straw has a wide range of uses such as for bio-mass, fibre, mulch, paper-making and thatching[171]. Some caution is advised in its use as a mulch since oat straw can infest strawberries with stem and bulb eelworm.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. Prefers a poor dry soil[134]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible seed, especially in wetter and cooler climates such as Wales, Scotland and Ireland[50, 61], it is lower yielding than A. sativa and considered to be no more than a weed in many areas[61]. The smallness of its grain renders it unfit for cultivation in any but poor mountainous soils[2]. It could, however, be of value in any breeding programme for the cultivated oats. Oats are in general easily grown plants but, especially when grown on a small scale, the seed is often completely eaten out by birds. Some sort of netting seems to be the best answer on a garden scale.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ in early spring or in the autumn. Only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.,
