4,Known Hazards,"No members of this genus are known to be poisonous, but when grown on nitrogen-rich soils they are known to concentrate nitrates in the leaves. This is especially noticeable on land where chemical fertilizers are used. Nitrates are implicated in stomach cancers, blue babies and some other health problems. It is inadvisable, therefore, to eat this plant if it is grown inorganically.",

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - cooked as a spinach or eaten raw[46, 58]. Seed - cooked. A cereal substitute. Very small, about 1mm in diameter[266], but easy to harvest and very nutritious. The seed can be cooked whole, and becomes very gelatinous like this, but it is rather difficult to crush all of the small seeds in the mouth and thus some of the seed will pass right through the digestive system without being assimilated[K]. The crisp interior of large stems makes a tasty cooked vegetable.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,Yellow and green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Requires a hot sheltered position if it is to do well[K]. Plants should not be given inorganic fertilizers, see notes above on toxicity. Cultivated for its edible seed and leaves[46, 58], there are many named varieties. It is an excellent hot weather substitute for spinach. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species with many botanists saying that it is no more than a synonym for A. tricolor[200, 266]. Most if not all members of this genus photosynthesize by a more efficient method than most plants. Called the 'C4 carbon-fixation pathway', this process is particularly efficient at high temperatures, in bright sunlight and under dry conditions[196].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow late spring in situ. An earlier sowing can be made in a greenhouse and the plants put out after the last expected frosts. Germination is usually rapid and good if the soil is warm[133]. A drop in temperature overnight aids germination[133]. Cuttings of growing plants root easily[206].,
