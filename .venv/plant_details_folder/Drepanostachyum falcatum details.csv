18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[25]. Used as a vegetable[272]. They are also fermented and preserved in Nepal to form a dish called tama[272]. Tama is sour and has a very strong flavour, it is sometimes mixed in vegetable curries[272]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"The canes are used for making hats, baskets, rods etc[46, 51, 61, 272]. The culms are not very straight, and they have rather swollen nodes, which make them not very suitable as a weaving material[220]. Nevertheless, they are still widely used for this purpose in the Himalayas[220]. They are also used in construction[195]. They are about 2cm in diameter[220]. The plant is used as a very effective soil stabilizer in Nepal[220]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers an open loam of reasonable quality and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1]. Requires a sheltered position[25]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is only reliably hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1, 11, 25, 162], tolerating temperatures down to about -6°c. In most parts of the country it is best grown in a conservatory. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants flower quite frequently in Britain and often produce viable seed[11]. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The rootstock is caespitose, new shoots are produced from late May[25]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings."
