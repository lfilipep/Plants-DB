The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,"Antianxiety: Helps relieve anxiety.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antianxiety  Antiarrhythmic  Cardiotonic  Diuretic  Sedative  VasoconstrictorMedicinal Parts: Roots and whole plant[301]. Pheasant's eye has a long history of medicinal use and is still retained in the Pharmacopoeias of several European countries[268]. The plant contains cardiac glycosides similar to those found in the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea)[254]. These substances improve the heart's efficiency, increasing its output at the same time as slowing its rate[254]. It also has a sedative action and so is generally prescribed for patients whose hearts are beating too fast or irregularly[254]. The herb is not often prescribed, however, due to irregular absorption[268]. The herb is cardiotonic, diuretic, sedative and vasoconstrictor[4, 7, 9, 13, 46, 238]. It has sometimes been used internally as a cardiotonic with success where the better known foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) has failed - especially where there is also kidney disease[4]. The herb is also used in the treatment of low blood pressure and its strong diuretic action can be used to counter water retention[254]. It is included in many proprietary medicines, especially since its effects are not cumulative[238]. The plants are harvested every third year as they come into flower[7], they are dried for use in tinctures and liquid extracts[238]. The herb does not store well so stocks should be replaced every year[238]. Use with great caution[9], see the notes above on toxicity. The plant is used in homeopathy as a treatment for angina[254]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine approve Adonis vernalis for arrhythmia, and nervous heart complaints (see [302] for critics of commission E)",,None known,,"Grows well in any ordinary garden soil that is not too heavy[1]. Prefers a moist well-drained soil in sun or semi-shade[4, 200]. Easily grown in a very well-drained rather dry soil in sun or part shade[187]. Plants flower better when growing in a sunny position[268]. This plant is adored by slugs and is therefore very difficult to grow in the open garden where slugs are common[187]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is rather rare in the wild so only cultivated plants should be harvested[7]. A greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe or else it can be slow and erratic to germinate[200, 238]. Sow the seed in partial shade in rich soil in September or March[111]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first season. Plant out when dormant in the autumn[K]. Division in early spring or in autumn. The divisions can be difficult to establish[200], so it is probably best to pot them up and keep them in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
