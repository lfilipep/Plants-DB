3,USDA hardiness,7-11,
4,Known Hazards,"No members of this genus are known to be poisonous, but when grown on nitrogen-rich soils they are known to concentrate nitrates in the leaves. This is especially noticeable on land where chemical fertilizers are used. Nitrates are implicated in stomach cancers, blue babies and some other health problems. It is inadvisable, therefore, to eat this plant if it is grown inorganically.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - cooked as a spinach[46, 61, 144, 177, 183]. A mild flavour[K]. The leafy stems and flower clusters are similarly used[183]. On a zero moisture basis, 100g of leaves contains 283 calories, 34.2g protein, 5.3g fat, 44.1g carbohydrate, 6.6g fibre, 16.4g ash, 2243mg calcium, 500mg phosphorus, 27mg iron, 336mg sodium, 2910mg potassium, 50mg vitamin A, 0.07mg thiamine, 2.43mg riboflavin, 11.8mg niacin and 790mg ascorbic acid[218]. Seed - cooked. Very small, about 1mm in diameter[266], but it is easy to harvest and very nutritious[K]. The seed can be cooked whole, and becomes very gelatinous like this, but it is rather difficult to crush all of the small seeds in the mouth and thus some of the seed will pass right through the digestive system without being assimilated[K]. The seed contains 14 - 16% protein and 4.7 - 7% fat[218]. The nutty edible seeds can be eaten as snacks or used in biscuits. A porridge can be made by boiling the seeds in water. In northeastern Indian it is known as Cheng-kruk and eaten traditionally as a vegetable. In South India it is known as Kuppacheera. It is also a common vegetable in Bengali cuisine and is called ""note shak.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Dysentery  VermifugeA decoction of the entire plant is used to stop dysentery and inflammation[218]. The plant is emollient and vermifuge[218, 240]. The root juice is used to treat inflammation during urination[272]. It is also taken to treat constipation[272].",
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,Yellow and green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Requires a hot sheltered position if it is to do well[K]. Plants should not be given inorganic fertilizers, see notes above on toxicity. Cultivated as a food plant in the tropics[46]. Should this plant be called A. caudatus. L. 'Viridis'[200]? Most if not all members of this genus photosynthesize by a more efficient method than most plants. Called the 'C4 carbon-fixation pathway', this process is particularly efficient at high temperatures, in bright sunlight and under dry conditions[196].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow late spring in situ. An earlier sowing can be made in a greenhouse and the plants put out after the last expected frosts. Germination is usually rapid and good if the soil is warm[133]. A drop in temperature overnight aids germination[133]. Cuttings of growing plants root easily[206].,
