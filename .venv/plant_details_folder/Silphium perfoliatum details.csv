Main Bloom Time: Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Upright or erect.","Silphium perfoliatum is a PERENNIAL growing to 2.5 m (8ft 2in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Wild Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  Emmenagogue  Febrifuge  Hepatic  Pectoral  Stimulant  Styptic  Tonic  Women's complaintsCup plant was employed medicinally by several native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a variety of complaints[257]. It is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. A decoction of the root has been used to treat the stoppage of periods, and also to treat morning sickness and to prevent the premature birth of a child[257]. In view of these conflicting uses, it is best that it is not used by pregnant women unless under the guidance of a qualified practitioner[257]. The root is alterative, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, febrifuge, hepatic, stimulant, styptic and tonic. It is used in the treatment of liver and spleen disorders and has also been used to treat morning sickness[4, 61, 257]. A decoction of the root has been used internally in the treatment of back and chest pain and lung haemorrhages[257]. A decoction of the root has been used as a face wash to treat paralysis[257]. A poultice of the moistened dried root has been applied to wounds to stop the bleeding[257].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Succeeds in any ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a deep moisture retentive moderately fertile soil that is not too nitrogen rich, in sun or dappled shade[200]. Hardy to at least -25°c[187]. Plants have a deep and extensive root system which makes transplanting difficult. An aromatic resin exudes from the crushed leaves and stems[245]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[188]. This is very difficult due to the deep and extensive root system.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
