19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves and young shoot tips - raw or cooked[2, 5, 12, 62, 172, 183]. They can be used in salads or cooked as a vegetable[9]. When boiled they make a wholesome vegetable and are a good source of vitamins A and C[2, 257]. Only use the leaves when they are young[85]. Although they are said to be edible, another report says that an infusion of them can stupefy[4]. Young shoots - cooked. They make a good asparagus substitute[2, 9, 183, 213]. Root - raw, cooked or dried and ground into a powder[74, 172]. Used in spring, it has a sweet taste[12, 74]. Flower stalks - raw or cooked[85, 106, 172, 183]. Added to salads, they are used when the flowers are in bud[183]. The pith of young or older stems - raw or cooked[62, 99, 183]. Slightly sweet, tender and pleasing to eat, though there is not much of it[85, 172]. Gelatinous[161], it can be used as a flavouring in soups[183]. The stems are said to be a good laxative, but are best not eaten on an empty stomach[256]. A tea is made from the dried leaves[9, 62, 85, 94, 183], it is sweet and pleasant[172]. Called 'kaporie' tea in Russia, it contains 10% tannin[222]. The leaves are also used as an adulterant of China tea[2].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Demulcent  Dysentery  Emollient  Hypnotic  Laxative  Poultice  TonicWillow herb is often used as a domestic herbal remedy, though it is little used in conventional herbalism. The herb is antispasmodic, astringent, demulcent, emollient, hypnotic, laxative and tonic[4, 7, 172, 192]. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, mucous colitis and irritable bowel syndrome[254]. The plant is used in Germany and Austria to treat prostate problems[254]. A poultice of the leaves is applied to mouth ulcers[222]. An extract of the leaves has anti-inflammatory activity[222]. An ointment made from the leaves has been used to soothe skin problems in children[254]. A tea made from the leaves and roots is a folk remedy for dysentery and abdominal cramps[222]. A poultice made from the peeled roots is applied to burns, skin sores, swellings, boils etc[222, 257].",
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.,Weather protection: Plants that can be used to give the body protection from severe weather.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre obtained from the outer stems is used to make cordage[99, 207, 256]. The 'cottony' seed hairs are used as a stuffing material[99, 118] or as a tinder[106, 172]. The powdered inner cortex is applied to the hands and face to give protection from the cold[99, 172, 257].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a well-drained but moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200], though it succeeds in most soils[1]. It prefers a moist soil[111], but also succeeds on dry banks[188]. It is best grown in open woodland[1]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. The rosebay willowherb spreads vigorously by means of a creeping rhizome, and often forms large patches[187]. It is apt to become a weed especially through its seed which is very light and capable of travelling long distances in the wind. It is often one of the first plants to colonize disturbed areas such as scenes of fires[1, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is the floral emblem of the Yukon[172]. A food plant for the caterpillars of several lepidoptera species[24], it is also a good bee plant[74, 94]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in situ or as soon as the seed is ripe[111]. This plant is more than capable of finding its own way into most gardens and does not usually require an invitation. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
