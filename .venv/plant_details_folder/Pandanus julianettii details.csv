Sometimes karukas develop young suckers or shoots near the ground.  When these are seen, they are broken off and replanted from these vegetative suckers.  Trees from cuttings produce after 5-8 years. Seedling trees are slower to produce and have a taller straighter trunk.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
