The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a moist humus-rich soil and semi-shade, growing well in a woodland garden[1, 130, 200]. This species is not in the IOPI list of accepted plant names.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[175]. The seed is very slow to germinate, usually taking a year or more[175]. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring.",
