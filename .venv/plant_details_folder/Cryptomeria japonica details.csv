17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Depurative  VDAn oil and/or a resin from the plant is depurative and also used in the treatment of gonorrhoea[218].
22,Other Uses,"Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are very aromatic and are used as incense sticks[46, 61, 272]. A fairly wind-tolerant tree, it can be used in shelterbelt plantings[200].  - light, fragrant, fine grained[46, 61]. The wood is strongly rot resistant, easily worked, and is used for buildings, bridges, ships, lamp posts, furniture, utensils, and paper manufacture[1, 46, 61, 266]. The wood can be used as a substitute for Deal[146]. Old wood that has been buried in the soil turns a dark green and is then much esteemed[46, 61]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Screen, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a deep rich moist alluvial soil and a sheltered position in full sun[1, 11, 164]. Tolerates very acid to somewhat alkaline soils, but becomes chlorotic on shallow soils over chalk[200]. Plants are fairly wind-tolerant[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it has been widely cultivated as a forestry tree for several centuries in Japan and there are many strains each adapted to the various local conditions[11]. Many forms, almost all of them dwarf, have also been selected for their ornamental value[185, 200]. A fast-growing tree on deep, well-drained soils in montane areas with a warm, moist climate, but intolerant of poor soils and cold, drier climates[266]. Occasionally planted for timber in Europe[50], trees do not generally do as well as could be expected in Britain, the best specimens are to be found in the west, especially in the south-west[11]. Trees can grow quite fast in the western part of the country with annual increases of 1 metre or more[185]. New growth takes place from early June to August[185]. Growth decreases rapidly with age, virtually ceasing when the tree reaches 25 metres[185]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Unlike most conifers, this species can be coppiced[81]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a cold frame. The seed germinates better if given a short cold stratification for 2 - 3 weeks at 4°c and is then placed in a warm position[164]. Germination usually takes place within 3 - 9 weeks at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. An alternative is to plant out the young trees into an outdoor nursery bed when they are about 8cm tall and grow them on for a couple of years before planting them into their permanent positions in late autumn or early spring[164]. Cuttings in the autumn in a sandy soil in a cold frame."
