17,Edible Parts,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 33, 34, 37, K]. The raw root is rather tough, but has a nice, aromatic, starchy flavour[K]. When cooked it becomes floury and sweet[27] with a peculiar flavour that is excellent and unlike any other vegetable[183]. Peeling the roots ruins the flavour[183]. The root is about the size of a small carrot[2]. It can be harvested when the foliage dies down, usually in July/August from an autumn sowing, and stored like potatoes for later use[1]. It is best harvested as required[164]. The roots contain about 20% starch and 4% protein[74]. Young stems - raw or cooked[74]. Some caution is advised, see notes at the top of the sheet."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in almost any soil[1], though it prefers a moist soil[27]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.6 to 7. The turnip-rooted chervil is occasionally cultivated for its edible root[46, 61], there is at least one named variety[183]. The sub-species C. bulbosum prescottii (synonym C. prescottii) is used in Russia[74]. The root of this sub-species contains about 17% starch[74]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in situ[33]. The seed has a very short viability[1] or, according to another report, the seed becomes dormant if allowed to dry out and will not germinate for a year[164]. If stored for a spring sowing it should be kept in damp sand in a cold but frost-free place and then sown in situ in March[1]. Another alternative is to sow the seed in the autumn in a seed tray in a cold frame and then to sow the seed, soil and all, in early April in situ[164]."
