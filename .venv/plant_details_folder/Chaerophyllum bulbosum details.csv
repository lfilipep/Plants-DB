0,Chaerophyllum bulbosum,Turnip-Rooted Chervil,Apiaceae or Umbelliferae,5-9,One report suggests that the leaves and roots are poisonous[1]. The same report says that this plant is cultivated for its edible root! The root is unlikely to be poisonous[K].,Fallow fields and water meadows from 1000 - 2100 metres in Turkey[93].,Europe to W.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Meadow; Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 33, 34, 37, K]. The raw root is rather tough, but has a nice, aromatic, starchy flavour[K]. When cooked it becomes floury and sweet[27] with a peculiar flavour that is excellent and unlike any other vegetable[183]. Peeling the roots ruins the flavour[183]. The root is about the size of a small carrot[2]. It can be harvested when the foliage dies down, usually in July/August from an autumn sowing, and stored like potatoes for later use[1]. It is best harvested as required[164]. The roots contain about 20% starch and 4% protein[74]. Young stems - raw or cooked[74]. Some caution is advised, see notes at the top of the sheet.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Tolerates a pH in the range 4.6 to 7. The turnip-rooted chervil is occasionally cultivated for its edible root[46, 61], there is at least one named variety[183]. The sub-species C. bulbosum prescottii (synonym C. prescottii) is used in Russia[74]. The root of this sub-species contains about 17% starch[74].","Seed - best sown in the autumn in situ[33]. The seed has a very short viability[1] or, according to another report, the seed becomes dormant if allowed to dry out and will not germinate for a year[164]. If stored for a spring sowing it should be kept in damp sand in a cold but frost-free place and then sown in situ in March[1]. Another alternative is to sow the seed in the autumn in a seed tray in a cold frame and then to sow the seed, soil and all, in early April in situ[164].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
