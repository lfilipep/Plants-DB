24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1]. Requires a sunny position[182] and a well-drained soil[200]. Not very hardy outdoors in Britain, plants tolerate temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c provided they are grown in a perfectly drained soil with the protection of a south or south-west facing wall[200]. Plants can regrow from buds low down on old wood if the are cut back by frosts[200]. There are tender and hardy forms of this species[166]. Flowers are produced on the previous seasons growth and also late in the season on the current seasons[200]. Cultivated in Chile for its young shoots, which are used to make a drink[11], and also for its medicinal properties[139]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in early to mid spring in a greenhouse[200]. as soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11].",
