P.V.Heath Sussex Cactus & Succ. Yearbook, 1987 (ed. P. Heath) 56. 1987","Sedum rupestre is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Sedum reflexum L.,Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall.

A slightly astringent sour taste makes this plant a useful addition to a green tossed salad and it can also be added to soups or used as a vegetable[9, 183]. Used in salads, it has a fine relish[2].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Agroforestry Uses:A good ground cover plant for a sunny position[188]. The somewhat open growth habit makes it suitable for growing with larger bulbs such as some lilies[K]. Place starter plants 20 - 30cm apart in order to obtain rapid massing as a ground cover[352].The plant is used on 'green roof' and 'green wall' systems in Korea. These systems are incorporated into the structure of the building, providing habitats for wildlife as well as insulating the building and helping to improve the environment. The cultivar 'Blue Spruce' has been specifically mentioned[1240, 1241]",,"Succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Requires a sunny position[188, 200]. The plant flowers best when grown in a sunny position, though it also succeeds in semi-shade[219]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200], they grow well in dry soils and can also be grown in a crevice on a wall[200, 219]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[200]. A mat forming plant, it spreads rapidly and it is not suitable for the rockery[83]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species, such as this one, that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2].","Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
