0,Lathyrus sylvestris,"Flat pea, Wood pea",Leguminosae,6-9,"All parts of the plant, but especially the seed, contain a toxic amino-acid. It is produced in the plant at about the same time that the seed starts to develop. In small quantities the amino acid is innocuous, and the seeds of several Lathyrus species are eaten as a nutritious part of the diet. However, in larger quantities (the seed should form less than 30% of a balanced diet), it can cause a very serious disease of the nervous system known as 'lathyrism'. Symptoms appear as a paralysis of the muscles below the knees, pains in the back, followed by weakness and stiffness of the legs and progressive locomotive incoordination[65 , 76 , 1309 ].",Thickets and woods[17].,"Eurasia - Norway through Britain to Spain, east to Western Siberia, the Caucasus and Greece",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Lathyrus_sylvestris1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Lathyrus_sylvestris2.JPEG",,"Lathyrus sylvestris is a deciduous Perennial Climber growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate.

Nitrogen Fixer.",,"Lathyrus sylvestris is a moderately cold-hardy plant, able to tolerate temperatures down to around -20?c when fully dormant[200 ]. Grows well in full sun and in light, dappled shade, succeeding in most moderately fertile, well-drained soils[200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[1309 ].
