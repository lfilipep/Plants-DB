13,Summary,"Pausinystalia johimbe or commonly known as Yohimbe is native to western and central Africa. It is evergreen and grows up to 30m tall with a straight bole that can be up to 60cm in diameter. The leaves are oval-shaped. The bark is gray to reddish-brown. Yohimbe is used medicinally as stimulant, anti-diuretic, hypotensive, and bitter herb. It has aphrodisiac effects and is hallucinogenic. In particular, it is used in the treatment of impotence, frigidity, and angina. The bark is also a source of tannins. The wood is used as firewood and construction material. There is no known edible use of this plant."

18,Medicinal Uses,"Anaesthetic: Numbs the feeling in a local or general area of the body.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Hallucinogenic: Causes the mind to hallucinate.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anaesthetic  Aphrodisiac  Cardiac  Hallucinogenic  Hypotensive  Stimulant  VasodilatorThe bark contains up to 6% of a mixture of indole alkaloids, the principle one being yohimbine (which is also known as aphrodine), plus pigments and tannins[254 , 418 ]. The alkaloids have a cerebral stimulant action at low doses, but are highly toxic in large doses[254 ]. Yohimbine has been shown to block the release of adrenalin and, in the correct dose, act as a sexual stimulant[238 ]. It is the source of the only clinically-proven cure for impotence and has long been used as a traditional stimulant in Africa[418 ]. Yohimbe is a bitter, warming, anti-diuretic, hypotensive and vasodilating herb with reputedly aphrodisiac effects[238 ]. It has a stimulant effect upon the heart, increasing heart rate and blood pressure; has a locally anaesthetic action similar to that of cocaine but without being mydriatic; is a mild stimulant that can help to prevent drowsiness; and is hallucinogenic. The vasodilating action of yohimbe is particularly strong on the sex organs, hence its aphrodisiac action[238 , 303 ]. The bark is taken internally, either as a powder or as a decoction. It is used particularly in the treatment of impotence, frigidity and angina[238 , 418 ]. It is also used as a performance enhancer for athletes, and as a remedy to increase the clarity of the voices of singers during long festivals[303 , 418 ]. The bark can be harvested at any time of the year[254 ]. The use of this herb is subject to legal restrictions in some countries[238 , 254 ]."
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The bark is a source of tannins[418 ]. The inner bark is utilized as straps for panniers[303 ]. The tree produces very little sap-wood, the major fraction being an ocreous-yellow heart-wood[332 ]. The wood is flexible, so is widely used as a snare-trap mechanism, whilst the young poles are used for construction purposes in traditional buildings[303 ]. The wood is used as fuel[303 , 418 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the humid, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 500 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature ranges between 22 - 28°c, but can succeed at 18 - 35°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range of 2,000 - 4,000mm, but tolerates from 1,500 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in partial shade[418 ]. Grows best in a fertile, moist but well-drained, medium to heavy soil with high humidity[238 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, but can tolerate 5 - 7.5[418 ]. A fast growing tree but the bole never reaches a great diameter[303 ]. The species coppices well, producing strong, highly phototrophic shoots[303 ]. The bark is harvested as the source of the alkaloid yohimbine. The main stem gives the best material but is not rich in alkaloids until the tree is 15 - 20 years of age, by which time it can contain 2 - 15% yohimbine. Bark exploitation is a seasonal activity as the yohimbine levels are highest during the rainy season[303 ]. Although the trees callus well after a small amount of bark removal, removal of large quantities of bark can lead to an attack by a small stem borer which penetrates the unprotected stem, killing the tree[303 ]."
