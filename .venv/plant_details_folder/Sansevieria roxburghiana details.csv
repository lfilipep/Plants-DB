The natural elasticity of the fibre makes it suitable for making bowstrings[454 ]. The fibre is used for the preparation of cordage and matting in the regions where it occurs, and is much valued in Europe for ropes used in deep-sea dredging[454 ]. It has been used for making paper, but is too expensive a fibre for this use[454 ]. The fibre is usually prepared by taking the fresh leaves and placing one of them on a smooth board which is raised at one end. The lower end of the leaf is then pressed down by the toe of the workman, who squats on the plank, and with a blunt knife, or piece of iron plate scrapes upward along the surface of the leaf and thus deprives it of its fleshy pulp by successive scrapings, turning the leaf over and over, as may be necessary. When the pulp is thoroughly removed, the fibre is washed for three or four minutes, and dried in the shade[454 ]. Washing in brackish or salt water, or continuous soaking in water is said to destroy the glossy white appearance of this fibre[454 ].
