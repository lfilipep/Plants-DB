20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"A good quality fibre is obtained from the leaves[454 ]. The fibre is pliant, soft, and silky[454 ]. The natural elasticity of the fibre makes it suitable for making bowstrings[454 ]. The fibre is used for the preparation of cordage and matting in the regions where it occurs, and is much valued in Europe for ropes used in deep-sea dredging[454 ]. It has been used for making paper, but is too expensive a fibre for this use[454 ]. The fibre is usually prepared by taking the fresh leaves and placing one of them on a smooth board which is raised at one end. The lower end of the leaf is then pressed down by the toe of the workman, who squats on the plank, and with a blunt knife, or piece of iron plate scrapes upward along the surface of the leaf and thus deprives it of its fleshy pulp by successive scrapings, turning the leaf over and over, as may be necessary. When the pulp is thoroughly removed, the fibre is washed for three or four minutes, and dried in the shade[454 ]. Washing in brackish or salt water, or continuous soaking in water is said to destroy the glossy white appearance of this fibre[454 ]. Industrial Crop: Fiber.",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropSubtropical to tropical climate in semi-arid to humid locations. Requires a sunny position in a well-drained soil[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7[200 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200 ]. The plant can spread freely at the roots.,
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - Division of the rootstock. Leaf cuttings. Cut the leaf into sections about 5cm long, place in a 2:1 mix of sand and peat in a propagating case with a bottom heat of 18°c[200 ].",
