24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile, well-drained, moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates semi-shade though fruit production will be reduced. A very vigorous plant, spreading by means of runners. Fruits have only been produced occasionally on our trial ground in Cornwall, possibly because all the plants are the same clone[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 4 weeks or more to germinate. The seedlings are very small and slow-growing at first, but then grow rapidly. Prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out during the summer. Division of runners, preferably done in July/August in order to allow the plants to become established for the following years crop[200]. They can also be moved in the following spring if required, though should not then be allowed to fruit in their first year. The runners can be planted out direct into their permanent positions."
