See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",L. divaricata. L. mexicana.

The stems and leaves are a tea substitute[183]. The twigs are chewed to alleviate thirst[2, 183]. A resin is obtained from the leaves and twigs, it delays or prevents oils and fats from becoming rancid[183].","Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Expectorant  Odontalgic  UrinaryCreosote bush was widely used by various North American Indian tribes. A decoction of the leaves was used to treat diarrhoea and stomach troubles whilst the young twigs were used to treat toothache and a poultice of the leaves was used to treat chest complaints and as a wash for skin problems[254]. It continued to be widely used as a treatment for rheumatic disease, venereal infections, urinary infections and certain types of cancer, especially leukaemia until its sale was banned in North America due to concern over its potential toxic effect upon the liver[254]. There have been a number of cases of acute or sub-acute hepatitis attributed to the use of this herb and so its internal use is not recommended until further research has been carried out[254]. A tea made from the leaves is used as an expectorant and pulmonary antiseptic[213]. Some N. American Indian tribes heated the shoot tips of this plant and dripped the sap (probably the resin[K]) into tooth cavities to treat toothache[213].",,Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon.,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.","Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: CoppiceRequires a moderately fertile moisture-retentive soil in full sun or light shade[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. The plant is resinous and aromatic[200]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: experimental. Management: coppice.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.
