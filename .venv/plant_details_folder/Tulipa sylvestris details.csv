22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a well-drained soil[90]. It can be naturalized in short grass[90]. The plant is often found growing in chalk pits in the wild and so should do well on alkaline soils[245]. The plant can increase quite rapidly by means of underground stolons and can be difficult to eradicate[245]. Bulbs can be harvested after the plants have died down in July, stored in a cool dry place and then replanted in October[1]. The flowers have a most pronounced perfume[245]. This species is in cultivation in Britain under the name 'Tabriz'[90].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a shady part of the cold frame as soon as it is ripe in early summer[1], or in the early autumn[200]. A spring sowing of stored seed in the greenhouse also succeeds[K]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be grown on without disturbance for their first growing season - apply liquid feeds to the pot if necessary. Divide the bulbs once the plants have become dormant, putting 3 - 4 bulbs in each pot. Grow the on in the greenhouse for at least the next year, planting them out when dormant. Division of offsets in July. Larger bulbs can be planted out straight into their permanent positions, or can be stored in a cool place and then be planted out in late autumn. It is best to pot up smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out when they are dormant in late summer to the middle of autumn.",
