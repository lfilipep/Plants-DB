The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.,,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[257]. An agreeable acid flavour but the fruit is dry and mealy[95]. Hard to digest, the fruit should be eaten in moderation[95]. It can be dried and ground into a powder and then used as mush or as a flavouring in soups etc[257]. A cooling drink can be made from the fruit[161, 257].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  SkinAn infusion of the leaves is used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257]. An infusion is also used in the treatment of the rash caused by poison oak, Toxicodendron diversiloba[257].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. The wood makes a good fuel, producing a long-lasting hot fire[257]. The hard wood has been used for making small tools, awl handles etc[257].",,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[3, 11, 166, 200], but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. This species is closely related to A. manzanita[11]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. The cuttings are very slow and can take a year to root[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
