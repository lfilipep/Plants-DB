22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. The wood makes a good fuel, producing a long-lasting hot fire[257]. The hard wood has been used for making small tools, awl handles etc[257]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[3, 11, 166, 200], but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. This species is closely related to A. manzanita[11]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. The cuttings are very slow and can take a year to root[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200]."
