23,Other Uses Description,"The bark is thick and corky[200]. Can this be used as a source of cork[K]? The following uses are for the closely related P. amurense. They almost certainly also apply to this tree. A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark[178]. An oil obtained from the seed has insecticidal properties similar to pyrethrum[57].  - heavy, hard, strong, close grained. Used for furniture[74].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moisture retentive well-drained deep rich loam in an open position in full sun[11, 200]. Grows best in areas with long hot summers[200]. Plants are gross feeders and require a rich soil if they are to perform well[11]. Dormant plants are hardy to at least -20°c, but the young growth is liable to damage from late spring frosts[11, 200]. This species is occasionally cultivated for timber in S.E. Europe[50]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. The fruit is produced copiously on trees in Britain[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification, sow in late winter in a cold frame[78, 113]. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in autumn and over winter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Root cuttings - obtain in December and store in leafmold in a warm place for 3 weeks. Cut into 4cm lengths and plant horizontally in pots. Grow on in a warm greenhouse. Good percentage[78].",
