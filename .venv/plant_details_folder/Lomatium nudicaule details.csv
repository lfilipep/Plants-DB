Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Root - raw or cooked[207]. The taste is rather like a hot spicy parsnip[207]. The root can be roasted and used as a vegetable, or can be dried and ground into a powder then used as a flavouring in soups etc[105, 161]. Leaves and young shoots - eaten as a vegetable or used as a celery-like flavouring in soups etc[177, 183, 257]. The leaves, stems and flowers are infused and used as a beverage[161, 183, 257]. Seed - raw or cooked[257]. The immature seed is chewed as a refreshing snack and can be used as a flavouring in soups etc[257]. The vitamin C content of young plants is remarkably high, one cup providing more than the recommended daily allowance[183]. (the part of the plant is not referred to, it is probably the leaves)","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  Laxative  Pectoral  Poultice  Vitamin CThe seeds are analgesic, diaphoretic, febrifuge, laxative and pectoral[257]. They have been chewed in the treatment of fevers, colds and sore throats[257]. An infusion has been used by pregnant women to ensure an easy delivery[257]. A poultice of the crushed seeds has been applied to the head to relieve the pain of headaches[257]. The poultice has also been applied to sore places, pains and itches[257].","Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The seed is spicy and aromatic, it is used as a house fumigant and deodorant. It also repels mosquitoes[99].",,"Requires a sunny position in a fertile well-drained soil[188]. Plants are frost hardy[188]. This is a taxonomically very difficult genus, many of the species now included in it have at times been included in other genera[60]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[188]. Stored seed can be rather slow to germinate, when sown in the spring it usually takes at least 12 months to germinate. Giving it a period of cold stratification might reduce this time. The seedlings need to be pricked out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and should be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer. Fresh seed can be sown immediately in situ[188]. Division may be possible in spring or autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
