24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position in a fertile well-drained soil[188]. Plants are frost hardy[188]. This is a taxonomically very difficult genus, many of the species now included in it have at times been included in other genera[60]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[188]. Stored seed can be rather slow to germinate, when sown in the spring it usually takes at least 12 months to germinate. Giving it a period of cold stratification might reduce this time. The seedlings need to be pricked out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and should be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer. Fresh seed can be sown immediately in situ[188]. Division may be possible in spring or autumn.",
