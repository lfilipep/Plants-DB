23,Other Uses Description,Carbon Farming Solutions - Agroforestry Services: living fence (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland).
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropClimate: cold temperate to tropical. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. Sandy to gravelly soils[228]. Requires a sandy or very well-drained soil[160]. Dry situations. In the harsher areas of the North American deserts, a Cholla may be the only cactus present where only creosote bush (Larrea tridentada) grows as its companion. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a very well-drained compost. Cuttings of leaf pads at any time in the growing season. Remove a pad from the plant and then leave it in a dry sunny place for a couple of days to ensure that the base is thoroughly dry and has begun to callous. Pot up into a sandy compost. Very easy, rooting quickly."
