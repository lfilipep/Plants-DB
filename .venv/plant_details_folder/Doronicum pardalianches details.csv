22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in sun or semi-shade in ordinary garden soil[1, 200]. Prefers a moist soil[187]. Requires some protection from the strongest sun in summer[200]. Succeeds in the shade of trees[200]. Plants spread freely at the roots[188]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. This plant used to be commonly cultivated as a medicinal plant[17]. It has a somewhat invasive tuberous root system and will colonize thin woodland, it can also be grown in coarse grass that is cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse from April to June and make sure the compost does not dry out[175]. A diurnal temperature difference is beneficial to germination[175]. The seed usually germinates in 10 - 20 days at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in autumn[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
