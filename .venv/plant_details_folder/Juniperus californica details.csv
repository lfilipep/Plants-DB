See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from February to April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A thick, sweet, dry, fibrous and non-resinous flesh[82, 229]. It can also be dried and ground into a powder then used as a flavouring in various dishes or eaten as a mush[36, 61, 82, 105, 257]. The fruit is produced abundantly in the wild, though it is unlikely to be freely produced in Britain[K]. The cones are about 10 - 20mm in diameter[200].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antispasmodic  Birthing aid  Diaphoretic  HypotensiveThe scorched twigs have been rubbed on the body in the treatment of fits[257]. The leaves are analgesic, diaphoretic and hypotensive[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of high blood pressure, coughs and colds and to bring relief from a hangover (the bark was also used in this case)[257]. It has also been taken by pregnant women just prior to childbirth in order to relax the muscles[257].","Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","- soft, close grained, durable in contact with the soil. It is used for fencing and fuel[82].",,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Rock garden, Screen, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[1, 11, 200]. Established plants are drought tolerant, succeeding in hot dry positions[200]. A slow-growing and generally long-lived tree[229], all introductions to Britain up to now (1990) have proved tender, this plant is only really suitable for hot dry climates[81]. Grows better in dry areas with hot summers, W. Britain is generally to cool and wet for this species to thrive[200]. The seed takes two summers to ripen[229]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Fragrant foliage, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
