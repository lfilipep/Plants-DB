26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if they are large enough. Otherwise, grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year.",
