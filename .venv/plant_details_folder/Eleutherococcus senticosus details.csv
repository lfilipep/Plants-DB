Unlike many herbs with a medicinal use, it is more useful for maintaining good health rather than treating ill health. Research has shown that it stimulates resistance to stress and so it is now widely used as a tonic in times of stress and pressure[254]. This plant is a very commonly used folk treatment in China and Russia where it is used as a ginseng substitute[218]. It is a pungent bitter-sweet warming herb that is said to be stronger in its action than ginseng[238]. Regular use is said to restore vigour, improve the memory and increase longevity[218]. The root and the root bark are adaptogen, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycaemic, tonic and vasodilator. It is taken internally during convalescence and in the treatment of menopausal problems, geriatric debility, physical and mental stress etc[238]. It works by strengthening the bodies natural immune system[140, 165, 176, 238]. It has also been used to combat radiation sickness and exposure to toxic chemicals[200, 218, 238].

Stored seed requires 6 months warm followed by 3 months cold stratification[113] and can be very slow to germinate[133].
