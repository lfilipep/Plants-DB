22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained sandy loam in a sunny position[1, 200]. Does not do well on wet clay soils but succeeds in most other soils[115]. This species is possibly more tolerant of poor soils than P. rhoeas[17]. Plants usually self-sow freely when growing in suitable conditions so long as the soil surface is disturbed[238]. When growing in cereal fields, poppies decrease the yields of nearby cereal plants[18, 20]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ[200].,
