Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Bach  Haemostatic  OphthalmicThe leaves are haemostatic[7]. They are used in external compresses to stop bleeding and heal wounds[7]. A distilled water made from the leaves is an effective eye lotion[7]. The leaves are harvested in August and dried for later use[7]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Tiredness', 'Weariness' and 'Mental and physical exhaustion'[209].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Plants can be grown as a medium to tall hedge, they retain their dead leaves throughout the winter if clipped at least once a year in late summer[11, 29, 186]. They should not be clipped in spring since they will bleed profusely[200].

Thrives in any good loam, including chalk[1, 11], it does not demand much light[186]. Prefers a deep open loam[1] and does well on damp clays[186]. Succeeds in all but the most acid soils[186]. Dormant trees are very cold tolerant, the young growth is not usually damaged by late spring frosts[186]. The trees cast a deep shade[98, 186]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Trees are shallow-rooted[7]. The hornbeam has 28 species of associated insects[24]. Trees take 10 - 20 years from seed before they produce seed[98] and about 100 years to reach maturity[186]. At one time this tree was commonly pollarded or coppiced for its wood and for fuel[11, 13, 186]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown in an outdoors seedbed as soon as it is ripe[78]. Germination is usually good, though it may take 18 months[80]. If collected whilst still 'green' (after the seed is ripe but before it has dried fully on the plant) and sown immediately it should germinate in the following spring[80]. Grow the plants on for two years in the seedbed and then plant them out into their permanent positions in the winter. The average seed viability is around 65%[98]. Pre-treat stored seed with 4 weeks warm and 12 weeks cold stratification and sow in a cold frame[98]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 15cm tall before planting them into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
