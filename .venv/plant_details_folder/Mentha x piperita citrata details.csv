Form: Spreading or horizontal.","Mentha x piperita citrata is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",M. aquatica citrata.

Used as a flavouring in salads or cooked foods[5]. A very pungent flavour, the leaves of the true eau-de-cologne mint are too aromatic for most tastes, though the cultivar 'Basil' has an excellent flavour and makes a very good substitute for basil in pesto[K]. A herb tea is made from the fresh or dried leaves[21, 183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Carminative  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Refrigerant  Stomachic  Tonic  VasodilatorEau de Cologne mint, like many other members of this genus, is often used as a domestic herbal remedy, being valued especially for its antiseptic properties and its beneficial effect on the digestion. Like other members of the genus, it is best not used by pregnant women because large doses can cause an abortion. The leaves and flowering plant are anodyne, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, cholagogue, diaphoretic, refrigerant, stomachic, tonic, vasodilator[4, 9, 21, 165]. A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, digestive disorders and various minor ailments[222]. The medicinal uses of this herb are more akin to lavender (Lavandula spp) than the mints. It is used to treat infertility, rapid heartbeat, nervous exhaustion etc[238]. The leaves are harvested as the plant comes into flower and can be dried for later use[238]. The essential oil in the leaves is antiseptic, though it is toxic in large doses[222].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc.","Landscape Uses: Container, Ground cover, Woodland garden. An essential oil obtained from the whole plant is a source of lavender oil which is used in perfumery[46, 105, 238]. It is also used in oral hygiene preparations, toiletries etc[238]. Formerly used as a strewing herb[14], the plant repels insects, rats etc[14, 18, 20]. Rats and mice intensely dislike the smell of mint. The plant was therefore used in homes as a strewing herb and has also been spread in granaries to keep the rodents off the grain[244]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils and situations so long as the soil is not too dry[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A sunny position is best for the production of essential oils, but the plant also succeeds in partial shade. Prefers a slightly acid soil[16]. Plants are very tolerant of neglect, succeeding in long grass[K]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Most mints have fairly aggressive spreading roots and, unless you have the space to let them roam, they need to be restrained by some means such as planting them in containers that are buried in the soil[K]. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[24]. A good companion for growing near cabbages and tomatoes, helping to keep them free of insect pests[14, 20]. The mint will need to be grown in containers to prevent it spreading too aggressively into the other plants. The whole plant has a strong minty aroma with a hint of ginger[245]. The plant produces a better quality essential oil if the plant is grown in dry ground[115]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Mentha species are very prone to hybridisation and so the seed cannot be relied on to breed true. Even without hybridisation, seedlings will not be uniform and so the content of medicinal oils etc will vary. When growing plants with a particular aroma it is best to propagate them by division[K]. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame. They will quickly become established and can be planted out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
