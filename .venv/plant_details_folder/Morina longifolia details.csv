22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a fertile, humus-rich, moisture retentive but well-drained sandy or gritty soil in a sunny position[1, 111, 200]. It grows best with a little shade and shelter from high winds[1]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[175]. A very ornamental plant[1], the leaves are spicily aromatic[187]. A fairly easy plant to grow, though it tends to be short-lived[187]. It is hardy to about -17°c when growing in a perfectly drained soil[187, 200]. It grows best in the western side of Britain, sometimes succumbing to cold in the south-east of the country[233]. Requires protection from slugs[K]. The flowers open in the evening and are pollinated by moths. If pollination does not take place by morning then the top of the pistil curves over and effects self-pollination[211]. Resents root disturbance[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual pots to minimize disturbance to the tap root. Overwinter in a well ventilated cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame[111]. Plant out into their permanent positions in the summer when the plants are at least 15cm tall. Division in spring is possible but very difficult. Divided plants are often extremely slow to re-establish[200]. It is best carried out immediately after the plant flowers[188]. Root cuttings in individual pots in November. Plants are quick to produce foliage but slow to form roots. They are best left in pots for 12 months before planting out[175].,
