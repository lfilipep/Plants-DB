A light roasting brings out more of the flavour[206]. The seed is an ingredient of the famous Chinese 'five spice' mixture[206]. The fruit is rather small but is produced in clusters which makes harvesting easy[K]. Each fruit contains a single seed. Young leaves are used as a condiment[105, 158, 183]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good deep well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. This species is closely related to Z. planispinum[200]. Flowers are formed on the old wood[206]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Stored seed may requires up to 3 months cold stratification, though scarification may also help[113]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. Germination should take place in late spring, though it might take another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Root cuttings, 3cm long, planted horizontally in pots in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78]. Suckers, removed in late winter and planted into their permanent positions[113]."
