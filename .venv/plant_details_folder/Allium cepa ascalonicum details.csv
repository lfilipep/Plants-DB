0,Allium cepa ascalonicum,Shallot,Alliaceae,4-8,"There have been cases of poisoning caused by the consumption, in large quantities and by some mammals, of this plant. Dogs seem to be particularly susceptible[76].",Not known in the wild.,Original habitat is obscure.,(5 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumAscalonicum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumCepaAscalonicum.jpg",,"Allium cepa ascalonicum is a BULB growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. ascalonicum.,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Bulb - raw or cooked. A mild onion flavour, the bulbs can be up to 6cm in diameter. They can be added to salads etc, cooked as a vegetable or used as a flavouring in soups etc[1, 2, 16, 37]. Leaves - raw or cooked. A pleasant onion flavour, though they should not be harvested in quantity since this would reduce production of the bulbs[K]. Flowers - raw. Used as a garnish on salads. The flowers are somewhat dry and are less pleasant than many other species[K].","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Nutritive: A food for convalescents to help restore strength.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stings: Used in the treatment of stings and insect bites.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health.

The bulb is anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic, hypotensive, lithontripic, stomachic and tonic[4, 7, 21]. When used regularly in the diet it offsets tendencies towards angina, arteriosclerosis and heart attack[254]. It is also useful in preventing oral infection and tooth decay[254]. Baked onions can be used as a poultice to remove pus from sores[254]. Fresh onion juice is a very useful first aid treatment for bee and wasp stings, bites, grazes or fungal skin complaints[7, 201]. When warmed the juice can be dropped into the ear to treat earache[254]. It also aids the formation of scar tissue on wounds, thus speeding up the healing process, and has been used as a cosmetic to remove freckles[7].","Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Polish: Plants used to give a shine to metals, wood etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Rust: Plants that can be used to prevent or treat rust.","The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent and can also be rubbed onto the skin to repel insects[7]. The plant juice can be used as a rust preventative on metals and as a polish for copper and glass[7]. A yellow-brown dye is obtained from the skins of the bulbs[141, 168]. Onion juice rubbed into the skin is said to promote the growth of hair and to be a remedy for baldness[7]. It is also used as a cosmetic to get rid of freckles[7]. The growing plant is said to repel insects and moles[201]. A spray made by pouring enough boiling water to cover 1kg of chopped unpeeled onions is said to increase the resistance of other plants to diseases and parasites[201].",,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil but tolerates most soils.[1, 200]. Does not grow well on heavy clays[200]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 to 7[200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.5 to 8.3. We are using the name A. cepa ascalonicum for this plant in order to differentiate it from the potato onion, A. cepa aggregatum, though it should really be included in A. cepa aggregatum[K]. This is a genuinely perennial form of A. cepa that is widely grown in temperate and tropical areas for its edible bulbs[200]. These are milder but smaller than the onion. There are several named forms[200]. The plant is easier to grow than onions, matures faster and keeps better[200], though yields are lower. Plants are very tolerant of high temperatures up to 30°c and bulbing only occurs at temperatures above 20°c[200]. Plants rarely produce viable seed in temperate areas, they are usually propagated by means of their bulbs, each one dividing up in the growing season to produce from 2 to more than 12 new bulbs[200]. Bulbs can become infected with virus, it is important to only plant clean stock[200]. Closely related to A. oschanini. O.Fedsch., a wild species found in C. Asia. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Plant out bulbs in late winter or very early spring. Plant firmly to half the bulbs depth and protect from birds until the bulbs have rooted[200]. (Birds seem to have a fascination for pulling the bulbs out of the ground and then leaving them lying on the surface[K].) Traditionally, bulbs were planted on the shortest day and harvested on the longest. Smaller bulbs are less likely to bolt as a result of exposure to cold conditions[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
