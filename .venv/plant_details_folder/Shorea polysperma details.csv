21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The heartwood is red-brown; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 6cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain interlocked with a visible silver figure and the presence of white lines (resin canals); there is a slight lustre. The wood ranges from soft to fairly hard; it is of medium weight; moderately durable, being fairly resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. The drying rate is normal to slow, there is a slight risk of distortion or checking, but once dry it is stable in service. The wood works well with normal tools; there is a tendency to tear in planing if tools are not kept sharp; pre-boring is necessary when screwing or nailing; it glues correct. The wood is used in a wide range of applications including interior and exterior panelling, joinery, furniture, cabinetwork, carpentry, flooring, stairs, ship building, boxes and crates, veneer[848 ]."

24,Plant Propagation,"We have no specific information for this species - the information below is a general guide for the genus. Seed - best sown as soon as possible. It does not require pre-treatment, but it is recommended to soak the seed for 12 hours prior to sowing[325 ]. The seeds are sown in seedbeds, where they are covered with a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) or with a thin layer of sawdust[325 ]. Germination of fresh seeds is usually good and rapid. About two weeks after germination, when the seedlings are 5 - 6cm tall, they are potted up into individual containers about 15 x 23cm with good drainage holes at their base[325 ]. It is normally recommended to use a mixture of forest soil and sand (at a ratio of 3:1) as the potting medium in order to introduce the appropriate mycorrhiza to the roots. The seedlings are placed in 50 - 60% sunlight and watered twice daily[325 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 30 - 40cm tall - harden the seedlings off in full sunlight for one month prior to planting[325 ]."
