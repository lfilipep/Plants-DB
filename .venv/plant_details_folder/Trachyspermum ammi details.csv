24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist soil in a sunny position[238]. This species is not frost tolerant[238], but it might be possible to grow it outdoors in Britain as a spring sown annual[K]. The plant is extensively cultivated as a spice in S. W. Asia."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species, but suggest that you try sowing the seed in situ in April. If this is not successful, then an earlier sowing in the greenhouse in March, planting out after the last expected frosts might be better[K]. It is quite possible that this species will not like to be transplanted, so either sow 4 - 5 seeds per pot, or sow in a tray and transplant to individual pots as soon as the seedlings are big enough to handle[K]."
