If this is not successful, then an earlier sowing in the greenhouse in March, planting out after the last expected frosts might be better[K]. It is quite possible that this species will not like to be transplanted, so either sow 4 - 5 seeds per pot, or sow in a tray and transplant to individual pots as soon as the seedlings are big enough to handle[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
