18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[183]. They are usually boiled in at least one change of water. The shoots are 3 - 8cm in diameter[266], they are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level.",

23,Other Uses Description,"The culms are tough and compact,they are used for building, papermaking and in making furniture, umbrellas, containers and agriculture implements[266]. The canes are a very important source of material for scaffolding and construction in Taiwan[195].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. It dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring.",
