13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Paeonia mascula is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Antitussive  TonicThe root is antispasmodic and tonic[4, 46, 61]. A tea made from the dried crushed petals of various peony species has been used as a cough remedy, and as a treatment for haemorrhoids and varicose veins[250].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep rich soil, preferably neutral or slightly alkaline[1], doing quite well in sun or light shade[1, 200]. Plants are tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions, but will not survive if the soil becomes waterlogged or is too dry[250]. This species is lime tolerant[200]. Plants grown on sandy soils tend to produce more leaves and less flowers, whilst those growing on clay take longer to become established but produce better blooms[250]. The sub-species P. mascula mascula succeeds in dry soils, its roots are subject to slug damage in moist soils[187]. The sub-species P. mascula hellenica. Tzanoudakis. comes into growth early in the year and may require protection from late frosts[187]. Plants are generally hardy to about -15°c[187], though some forms, especially the sub-species P. mascula hellenica, might need frost protection[250]. A very ornamental[1] and long-lived plant, living for 50 years or more in the garden[200]. A polymorphic species, there are at least 5 recognised sub-species[200, 250]. This species was cultivated as a medicinal plant in the Middle Ages[250]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A very greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes. A polymorphic species, there are a number of sub-species[187]. Strongly resents root disturbance, taking some time to recover after being divided[1]. Peony species are usually self-fertile, though they will also hybridise with other species if these flower nearby at the same time[250]. Plants take 4 - 5 years to flower from seed[200]. They generally breed true from seed[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[250]. When sown fresh, the seed produces a root about 6 weeks after sowing with shoots formed in the spring[200]. Stored seed is much slower, it should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame but may take 18 months or more to germinate[200]. The roots are very sensitive to disturbance, so many growers allow the seedlings to remain in their pots for 2 growing seasons before potting them up. This allows a better root system to develop that is more resilient to disturbance[250]. If following this practice, make sure you sow the seed thinly, and give regular liquid feeds in the growing season to ensure the plants are well fed. We usually prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and then grow them on in a cold frame for at least two growing seasons before planting them out when they are in growth in the spring[K]. Division with great care in spring or autumn. Each portion must have a leaf bud. If the lifted root is stood in shade for several hours it becomes less brittle and easier to divide[200]. Divisions that have several buds will usually flower in the second year, but those that only have one or two buds will take a number of years before they have grown sufficiently to flower[250].",
