22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a position in full sun in a fertile moisture retentive well-drained soil[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], in Britain it is only reliably hardy in the Scilly Isles[1]. Plants in Australian gardens tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. Seed can remain viable on the plant for 3 - 4 years[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring or autumn in a greenhouse and keep the compost moist until germination takes place. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].",
