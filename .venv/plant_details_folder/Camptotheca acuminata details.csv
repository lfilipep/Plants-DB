Cephalanthus esquirolii H.Lév.,,None Known,,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Used in traditional Chinese medicine to provide treatments for psoriasis, liver and stomach ailments, and common colds. Also used to treat leukemia. This latter use led to scientific study to determine if there actually was an anti-cancer compound in C. acuminata. The cancer-fighting properties were first verified in 1958 by Dr. Monroe E. Wall of the USDA and Jonathon Hartwell of the National Cancer Institute in the United States. The bark and stems of Camptotheca acuminata contain the alkaloid camptothecin. Several chemical derivatives of camptothecin are under investigation for or used as drugs for cancer treatment, including irinotecan, topotecan, rubitecan. Camptotheca acuminata also contains the chemical compounds trifolin and hyperoside.",,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: medicinal (Crops grown for non-food uses.
