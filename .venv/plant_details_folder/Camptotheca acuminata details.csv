19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Used in traditional Chinese medicine to provide treatments for psoriasis, liver and stomach ailments, and common colds. Also used to treat leukemia. This latter use led to scientific study to determine if there actually was an anti-cancer compound in C. acuminata. The cancer-fighting properties were first verified in 1958 by Dr. Monroe E. Wall of the USDA and Jonathon Hartwell of the National Cancer Institute in the United States. The bark and stems of Camptotheca acuminata contain the alkaloid camptothecin. Several chemical derivatives of camptothecin are under investigation for or used as drugs for cancer treatment, including irinotecan, topotecan, rubitecan. Camptotheca acuminata also contains the chemical compounds trifolin and hyperoside.",

21,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: medicinal (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. It is used as a street tree in some cities in China",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal  Management: Coppice  New CropClimate: warm temperate. Humidity: humid. Camptotheca acuminata grows very fast during the first ten years and then slows down in subsequent years. Light: Full sun/Light shade. Require deep, moist soil and shelter from strong winds. It can be pruned back without damage so is useful as a coppiced tree. Flowering Time in the Southern Hemisphere is in December to February. Flowers are small white and inconspicuous. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
