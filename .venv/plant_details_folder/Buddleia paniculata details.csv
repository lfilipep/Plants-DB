13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Buddleia paniculata is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Dysentery  FebrifugeA decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery[272], A decoction of the leaves, combined with the leaves of Crotalaria alata, is used in the treatment of fevers[272].",
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Plants are fairly fast growing and have an extensive root system, they are useful as pioneer species for restocking bare hillsides and preventing soil erosion on the slopes[158].  - moderately hard, close grained. Used only as a fuel[146, 158].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position[1, 11]. Succeeds in most well-drained garden soils but it prefers a rich loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. It resprouts freely from the base if cut back by severe weather[200]. Probably not in cultivation[11], this species is much confused with B. crispa. Benth[158]. A very ornamental plant[1], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. An excellent plant for bees and butterflies[30]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - cold stratify for 4 weeks at 4°c[138] and surface sow the seed in February/March in a greenhouse[78, 113] (the pre-chilling might not be required for this species). Germination usually takes place within 3 - 4 weeks at 21°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are inclined to damp off and so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Use short side-shoots[78]. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long, October/November in a frame[200].",
