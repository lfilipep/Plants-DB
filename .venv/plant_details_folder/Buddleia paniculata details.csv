India.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BuddlejaPaniculata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Buddleia paniculata is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",B. variabilis.

Used only as a fuel[146, 158].",,"Requires a sunny position[1, 11]. Succeeds in most well-drained garden soils but it prefers a rich loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. It resprouts freely from the base if cut back by severe weather[200]. Probably not in cultivation[11], this species is much confused with B. crispa. Benth[158]. A very ornamental plant[1], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. An excellent plant for bees and butterflies[30]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - cold stratify for 4 weeks at 4°c[138] and surface sow the seed in February/March in a greenhouse[78, 113] (the pre-chilling might not be required for this species). Germination usually takes place within 3 - 4 weeks at 21°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are inclined to damp off and so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Use short side-shoots[78]. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long, October/November in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
