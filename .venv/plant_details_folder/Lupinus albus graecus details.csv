Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65].","Disturbed ground on acid soils[45, 50].",S.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,Nitrogen fixer. Dynamic accumulator.,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any moderately good soil. Prefers a light acid soil but tolerates adverse conditions[87]. Requires a sunny position[200]. A form of L. albus with smaller seeds than the type. A deep rooting plant[87]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in mid spring in situ[1, 200]. You may need to protect the seed from mice. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
