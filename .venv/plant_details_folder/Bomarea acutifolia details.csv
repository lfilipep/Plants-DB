Plants are possibly hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1]. They prefer a minimum night temperature of 10°c[138]. Keep the plants almost dry in winter[138] and apply a good thick organic mulch to the roots[200]. The mulch should be removed as growth commences in the spring because the young shoots are very susceptible to slug damage[K]. This genus is closely related to Alstroemeria species[200]. The plant is closely related to B. shuttleworthi[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse, it will germinate in a few weeks[1]. Stratify stored seed for 3 weeks at 20°c, then 3 weeks at 5°c[138]. It usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c[138]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring, with care since the roots are brittle. Each portion must have some roots and a growth bud[1]. Pot up the divisions, grow them on in the greenhouse until they are well established and then plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer or late spring of the following year.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
