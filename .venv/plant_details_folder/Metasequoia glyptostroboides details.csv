Form: Pyramidal.","Metasequoia glyptostroboides is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from February to March, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can grow in water.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Hedge; Pond; Bog Garden;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants have an extensive root system and so they are used to stabilize river banks and paddy field walls[200].,,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most soils and situations[11], even in shallow standing water[81]. It is slow growing in dry soils or shallow chalk but grows rapidly in moist or wet soils[11, 29, 81]. Succeeds in most pH's down to 3.5[200]. Requires a sunny position but likes as much side shelter as possible[200]. A very hardy plant when dormant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[200]. The fresh spring growth, however, is subject to damage by late frosts[11, 200]. It grows best in south-eastern England and poorly in Scotland where it suffers from the lack of summer warmth[185, 200]. Growth can be very rapid when young with annual increases of 1 metre common. However, unless the tree is in a sheltered position and a moist soil the growth rate reduces dramatically once it is 6 metres tall[185]. New growth takes place from May to August[185]. This plant was only known from fossil records until it was discovered growing wild in China in 1941.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn in a frame. Very easy[81].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
