21,Other Uses Description,Plants can be grown as a tall hedge[29]. Plants have an extensive root system and so they are used to stabilize river banks and paddy field walls[200].
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most soils and situations[11], even in shallow standing water[81]. It is slow growing in dry soils or shallow chalk but grows rapidly in moist or wet soils[11, 29, 81]. Succeeds in most pH's down to 3.5[200]. Requires a sunny position but likes as much side shelter as possible[200]. A very hardy plant when dormant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[200]. The fresh spring growth, however, is subject to damage by late frosts[11, 200]. It grows best in south-eastern England and poorly in Scotland where it suffers from the lack of summer warmth[185, 200]. Growth can be very rapid when young with annual increases of 1 metre common. However, unless the tree is in a sheltered position and a moist soil the growth rate reduces dramatically once it is 6 metres tall[185]. New growth takes place from May to August[185]. This plant was only known from fossil records until it was discovered growing wild in China in 1941.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn in a frame. Very easy[81]."
