The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",R. commersonii illecebrosus. R. rosaefolius coronarius. R. sorbifolius.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Fairly large and sweet but insipid raw[11, K]. The fruit is said to develop more flavour when it is cooked[183]. Another report says that the fruit is sour, bitter and unpalatable raw[3, 183], though this does not agree with the plants we are growing[K]. The fruit is about 30mm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. A good ground cover plant for a sunny position or light shade[3]. It spreads freely once established, but dies down over the winter and thus can allow other species to invade[K].",,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit and occasionally naturalized in Europe[50]. Plants spread freely when in a suitable site and are apt to become invasive[182]. The plant adopts an almost herbaceous habit and is botanically a sub-shrub, only a small amount of woody stem persists overwinter[K]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
