18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Fairly large and sweet but insipid raw[11, K]. The fruit is said to develop more flavour when it is cooked[183]. Another report says that the fruit is sour, bitter and unpalatable raw[3, 183], though this does not agree with the plants we are growing[K]. The fruit is about 30mm in diameter[200].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,"A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. A good ground cover plant for a sunny position or light shade[3]. It spreads freely once established, but dies down over the winter and thus can allow other species to invade[K].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit and occasionally naturalized in Europe[50]. Plants spread freely when in a suitable site and are apt to become invasive[182]. The plant adopts an almost herbaceous habit and is botanically a sub-shrub, only a small amount of woody stem persists overwinter[K]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",
