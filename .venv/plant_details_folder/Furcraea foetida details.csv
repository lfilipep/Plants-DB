18,Medicinal Uses,
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The root has been used as blood purifying remedy[317 ]. An infusion with sweet oil is drunk as a treatment for syphilis[348 ]. The root is mixed with gin and used as a treatment for back pain[348 ]. The leaves are febrifuge[348 ]. They are used in a preparation with molasses or honey to treat children's obstinate colds[348 ].
20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Used as a hedge plant in desert gardens[317 , 418 ]. Other Uses: A strong, good quality fibre is obtained from the leaves[46 , 317 ]. It is thinner and softer than sisal[317 ]. The fibre is usable for ropes and sacks[317 ]. The long, soft fibre is used alone or with other fibres in twine, sacks, hammocks, and other products[418 ]. It breaks down in salt water but withstands fresh water[418 ]. The macerated young leaves are used as a hair shampoo and a soap[348 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 30?c, but can tolerate 16 - 34?c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,100mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Requires a well-drained, medium to light soil and a sunny position[200 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5.5 - 8[418 ]. Very drought tolerant, the plant is able to withstand a dry season of 8 months[418 ]. The plant has escaped from cultivation in some areas - in New Caledonia it has become a noxious weed[317 ]. The plants inflorescences produce bulblets in large quantities; these disperse naturally and form dense impenetrable stands which exclude native vegetation[413 ]. The plant takes 3 - 4 years before its first harvest, and thereafter it can be harvested every 2 - 3 years[418 ]. It has a total life span of 7 - 10 years[418 ]. Yields of between 60 - 90 tonnes/ha of green leaf can be obtained every other year, which compares to 2 - 3 tonnes of dry fibre[418 ]. Plants are monocarpic - they live for a number of years without flowering, then put all their energy into flowering and die afterwards[200 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - rarely produced[200 ]. Plants frequently produce large numbers of bulbils, which root and grow into new plants when they fall to the ground[200 ]. These bulbils have the capacity to remain viable for a number of years, even in unfavourable conditions[200 ]."
