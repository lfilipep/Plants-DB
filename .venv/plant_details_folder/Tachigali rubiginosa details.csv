It has a rounded crown and it grows about 5-10 m in height. Its bole is usually crooked and around 30-50 cm in diameter. No plant part is edible nor of medicinal importance. However, the tree is used as a pioneer species in reforestation projects. It also produces a good quality timber which makes an excellent fuel and charcoal.","Tachigali rubiginosa is a deciduous Tree growing to 7.5 m (24ft) by 7.5 m (24ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Sclerolobium paniculatum rubiginosum (Mart. ex Tul.) Benth.

Other Uses The wood is thick-textured, very heavy, hard, with high mechanical resistance and very durable. It is used locally for carpentry, but mainly for external purposes such as railway sleepers, fence posts and stakes[420 ]. The wood is an excellent fuel with a high calorific value, it is also used to make a very high quality charcoal[420 ]. The trees of many members of this genus yield a wood suitable for light construction, known in the trade as 'tachi'[848 ]. We do not have any more specific information for the wood of this species, but a general description of tachi wood is as follows:- The wood is light brown; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 6cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight or slightly interlocked. The wood is light to moderately heavy; soft to moderately hard; not very durable in one report[848 ], durable in another[420 ]. It seasons at a nornal rate with only a slight risk of distortion, but a high risk of checking; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It is fairly easy to work, but sawn surfaces can be somewhat fuzzy - stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring. The wood is used for purposes such as interior panelling and joinery, furniture components, light carpentry, crates and boxes[316 , 420 , 848 ].",,"Grows best in a sunny position[420 ]. Requires a well-drained soil[420 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[420 ]. A fast-growing tree, especially when young[420 ]. There are conflicting reports on whether or not this tree has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, so it is unclear as to whether this tree fixes atmospheric nitrogen.","Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the treated seed in a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. A low germination rate can be expected even if the seed is treated, with the seed sprouting within 28 - 35 days[420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
