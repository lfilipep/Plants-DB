24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a warm sunny and sheltered position in a rich well-drained soil. Plants are not very cold hardy in Britain and so are normally grown in a greenhouse. However, if they are started in a greenhouse in the spring and grown on well it is possible to get reasonable yields in most years outdoors in this country. Plants have been seen outdoors in an open sunny position at Kew on several occasions with ripe fruit[K]. Plants tolerate more cold than many cucurbits[196]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow mid spring in a rich compost in a warm greenhouse. Put 2 or 3 seeds in a pot and thin the seedlings to the strongest plant. Plant out after the last expected frost and give the plants some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well.
