17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Edible leaves - raw in salads or used as a flavouring in cooked foods such as soups and stews[2, 14, 21, 27, 46, 61, 100, 244]. A mild aromatic flavour[183] that is suggestive of aniseed[238]. The leaves are often used as a flavouring, they form the basis of the seasoning 'fines herbes'[200] and are an essential ingredient of 'bouquet garni'[244]. The leaves should always be used fresh because the delicate flavour does not withstand drying or prolonged cooking[238, 244]. The leaves are ready for harvesting in about 8 weeks from sowing, the plant responds well to cut and come again harvesting[200]. The flowers are used as a seasoning[183]. The root is said to be edible[177, 183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Digestive: Aids digestion.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Digestive  Diuretic  Expectorant  Ophthalmic  Poultice  StimulantChervil is not widely used as a medicinal herb, though it is sometimes employed as a 'spring tonic' for cleansing the liver and kidneys, is a good remedy for settling the digestion and is said to be of value in treating poor memory and mental depression[238, 244, 254]. The fresh plant, harvested just before flowering, is digestive, diuretic, expectorant, poultice and stimulant[9, 21, 201]. The juice is used in the treatment of dropsy, arthritis and chronic skin ailments[9]. The bruised leaves are used as a poultice for slow-healing wounds[9] and a warm poultice is applied to painful joints[268]. An infusion of the fresh leaves is also used as an eyewash to treat sore or inflamed eyes[244].",

23,Other Uses Description,The growing plant is said to repel slugs[238].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained moisture retentive soil[200]. Plants dislike hot dry summers[200], it is best to give summer crops a cool shady position but winter crops require a sunny position[14, 18, 37, 52]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.8 to 7.6. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[200]. Chervil is occasionally cultivated as a salad plant, especially in France[268]. There are some named varieties[183]. It can supply fresh leaves all year round from successional sowings, especially if given some protection in winter[238]. Although a biennial, it is usually cultivated as an annual[238]. It often self-sows when grown in a suitable position[18, 200]. Be careful if harvesting this plant from the wild because it is superficially similar to some poisonous species such as young plants of hemlock, Conium maculatum[244]. Chervil is an aromatic plant with pleasantly scented leaves[245]. It is said to be a good companion plant for growing with carrots and radishes[18, 201], the radishes becoming hotter and crisper[201]. It also grows well with dill and coriander[201]. When grown with lettuces it is said to protect them from aphids and ants, the plant is also said to repel slugs[238].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ in succession from February to October. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks[200]. The February, September and October sowings should be made in a very sheltered warm and sunny position outdoors or under some protection such as a frame. Other sowings can be made in a position that has at least some shade from the midday sun since the plant runs to seed quickly if it gets too hot or the soil is dry[238]. The seed only remains viable for about a year[238].",
