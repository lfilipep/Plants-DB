See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from August to September, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas.

Hard, heavy and durable according to another report[229]. Used for general construction and fuel[61].",,"Thrives in a well-drained loamy or peaty soil[11]. Established plants are very tolerant of hot dry conditions and of drought[81]. Tolerates poor sandy soils[81] but is then more subject to insect damage in a succession of dry seasons[11]. Requires a sunny position[81]. A fast-growing and long-lived tree in the wild[229], this species is the hardiest member of the genus[11], though it is still somewhat tender in Britain, at least in the north of the country[11]. It succeeds in most of Britain once it is established[81]. The sub-species A. arizonica glabra. (Sudw.)Little. is a very hardy form, thriving in any soil from chalk to acid sands, this is the form most commonly grown in Britain[200]. Trees are fairly fast-growing in Britain, new growth takes place from late May until mid-September and can reach 60cm per year on young trees[185]. Cultivated as a timber tree in Italy and occasionally in other parts of Europe[50]. The young tree has an attractive pyramidal shape and is widely grown as a Christmas tree in its native range[229]. The seed takes two summers to develop[229]. Mature cones often remain closed on the tree[81], only opening after the heat of a forest fire[200]. Plants are subject to injury by the wind[11, 81]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Three weeks cold stratification can improve germination rates[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c. The seedlings are very subject to damping off so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can store for several years[113]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, September in a frost-proof frame[1]. April/May is the best time to take cuttings[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
