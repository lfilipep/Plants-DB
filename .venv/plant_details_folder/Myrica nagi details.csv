0,Myrica nagi,Box Myrtle,Myricaceae,Coming soon,"Although no reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, there is a report for some members of this genus that some of the constituents of the wax might be carcinogenic[222].","Drier aspects to 1800 metres[146]. Open, mixed forests on mountain slopes at elevations of 300 - 2500 metres[266].",E. Asia - Himalayas.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Myrica nagi is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft 4in). It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",M. integrifolia. M. sapida.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2]. Sweet with a pleasant blend of acid, they are very pleasant eating[193]. About 13mm in diameter[194]. The fruit contains about 12.6% sugar, 1% protein, 0.4% ash[194]. Low in vitamin C, about 4.1mg per 100ml[194]. The fruit does not keep well, only lasting in good condition for 2 - 3 days after picking[194]. Yields from mature trees can be as high as 25kg per year, but are more often around 15.5kg[194].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antirheumatic  Antiseptic  Aromatic  Astringent  Carminative  Cholera  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Ophthalmic  Rubefacient  Stimulant  Vitamin CThe bark is antirheumatic, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, carminative, ophthalmic and stimulant[146, 158, 194, 240, 272]. It has proved useful in the treatment of fevers, asthma and coughs[240]. The juice is applied to treat rheumatism[272]. Mixed with ginger, it is used as a rubefacient in the treatment of cholera[240]. The juice of the bark is taken internally in the treatment of catarrh and headaches, and is applied externally to cuts and wounds[272]. A decoction of the bark is used in the treatment of fevers, asthma and diarrhoea[272]. This decoction is boiled to form a gelatinous mass that is applied as a poultice on sprains[272]. Combined with the bark of Quercus lanata, it is used as a decoction in the treatmnt of dysentery[272]. The juice of the unripe fruit is used as an anthelmintic[272].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wax: Used for making candles etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A wax covering on the fruit is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water and immersing them for a few minutes, the wax floats to the surface and is then skimmed off. The fruit is then boiled in water to extract the wax from the pulp and once more the wax is skimmed off. It is then strained through a muslin cloth and can be used to make aromatic candles. Candles made from this wax are quite brittle but are less greasy in warm weather[213]. They are slightly aromatic and do not smoke when put out, making them much more pleasant to use that wax or tallow candles[213]. The wax is also used in making soaps[213]. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark[146, 272]. The plant is a source of tannin[146]. (Probably the bark or the leaves[K].) The bark is said to contain 60 - 80% tannin[272].  - hard, close-grained. a good fuel[158]. Used mainly for fuel, though it is sometimes used for making poles for construction[272].",,"Prefers a moist soil. Grows well in an open position in a well-drained soil in sun or light shade[200]. Thrives in any ordinary garden soil. Prefers a lime-free loamy or peaty soil[1]. We are not sure how hardy this plant will be in Britain, it is unlikely to succeed outside the very mildest areas of the country. There is also some confusion between this species and M. rubra, it is possible that they are the same. The fruit is sold in local markets in the Himalayas[194]. It ripens over a fairly long period, so is not suitable for commercial cultivation[194]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Many species in this genus have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Barely cover the seed and keep it moist. Stored seed germinates more freely if given a 3 month cold stratification and then sown in a cold frame. Germination is usually good[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in the cold frame for the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up and overwinter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in November/December in a frame. Layering in spring[200]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
