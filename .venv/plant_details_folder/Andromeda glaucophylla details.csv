19,Edible Uses Description,"The tender leaves and shoot-tips are boiled as an aromatic tea[161, 177]. A delicious drink[183]. Some caution is advised since boiling the plant or infusing it in hot water is said to release a toxic chemical[183]. It is safer to soak the leaves in a jar of water in direct sunlight to make 'sun tea'[183]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained, moisture-retentive, lime-free, humus- rich soil and a shady position[133, 182, 200]. Plants spread slowly by means of suckers when they are grown in a suitable position[182]. This plant is considered to be no more than a sub-species of A. polifolia, but with a more southerly range[235], by some botanists[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in an acid compost in the greenhouse. Surface sow or only just cover the seed and place in a lightly shaded position[78, 133]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 12°c[133]. Prick out the young seedlings into individual pots as soon as possible, they are prone to damp-off and so should be kept well ventilated[78]. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out in early summer once they are 15cm or more tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame in a shady position. Takes 15 months[78]. Layering in August in a semi-shady position. Takes 18 months[78]. Division in early spring. The plants should be 'dropped' beforehand[78]. This entails digging up the plant 6 to 12 months earlier and replanting it somewhat more deeply. The buried branches will then root and form new plants when divided."
