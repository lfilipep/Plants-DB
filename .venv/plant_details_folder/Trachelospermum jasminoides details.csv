Requires the protection of a wall[11]. Plants are not very hardy outside the milder areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c when grown against a wall[200]. They tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c according to other reports[202, 260]. Plants are slow-growing when they are young and they are then more susceptible to damage by frost and cold winds[11, 202]. They may put on no new growth for the first 2 - 3 years after planting out[202]. A twining plant[182]. Plants are self-clinging on walls according to other reports[166, 200].

24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Ensure that the milky sap, which is excreted from the heel when the cutting is taken, has dried out before the cutting is inserted in the soil. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in summer[188]. The plant self-layers, sending out roots from leaf nodes and stem tips wherever they touch the ground[245]."
