13,Summary,"Spreading Hogweed or Boerhavia diffusa is a flowering plant used in Ayurveda. It is herbaceous and perennial. It grows up 70cm high and spreads up to 200 cm wide. It has slender, creeping and twinning stems. It is found throughout Asia, India, the Pacific, and southern United States. Its small, very sticky fruits that latch on to small migratory birds are considered to be of main factor for the wide dispersal of this species. It is used in traditional medicine as bitter, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant, laxative and stomachic. It is also used as against snake bite and decoction of leaves is used against jaundice. Aborigines eat the roots of B. diffusa. Leaves and seeds are edible as well when cooked. The plant is drought and frost tolerant and can be grown from seed sowing. Other common names are red spiderling, wineflower, punarnava, and tarvine."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Dysentery  Emetic  Expectorant  Laxative  StomachicSpreading hogweed is used in traditional medicine in several parts of its range, but is especially popular in India where it is a part of the Ayurvedic tradition. The whole herb, including the root, is used and it is said to be bitter, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant, laxative and stomachic[ 46 , 304 ]. Research has shown the presence of an alkaloid, beta sitosterol and various other compounds in the roots[ 304 ] An alcohol extract of the whole plant has shown significant antiinflammatory activity, a cardiotonic effect, an increase in blood pressure, a relaxant effect and promising diuretic activity[ 304 ]. The plant is emetic and purgative[ 348 ]. It is used in the treatment of various conditions including gastric disturbances, asthma, jaundice, anascara, anaemia and internal inflammation[ 46 , 304 , 348 ]. It has also been used as an antidote to snake venom[ 304 ]. A decoction of the leaves is used to treat jaundice[ 46 , 348 ]. The leaves are used in a cataplasm for treating indurated liver[ 348 ]. The root can be used as an ipecacuanha (Carapichea ipecacuanha) substitute[ 348 ]. Antispasmodic, very astringent, diuretic, emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and sudorific herb, it can be used in a decoction to treat dysentery and a range of other conditions[ 348 ]. The boiled roots are applied to ulcers, abscesses and to assist in the extraction of Guinea worm[ 299 ]."
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
23,Other Uses Description,"Boerhavia diffusa is recorded as a host for the virus causing aubergine mosaic disease (EMV); as a host of zucchini yellow mosaic polyvirus (ZYMV); and as an alternative host for the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii)[299]. Yield losses attributed to these factors are difficult to determine. /animal feed, Forage."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors at least in the milder parts of this country. It is hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to the British climate because our summers are cooler and our winters longer, colder and wetter. If the plant is capable of surviving our winters it is likely to need a sheltered very sunny position in a well-drained soil. Most if not all members of this genus have the same edible uses[193]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings"
