24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Dislikes wet or heavy clay soils[16, 37]. Prefers a slightly acid soil, the tubers are subject to scab on limy soils or those deficient in humus. Yields best on a fertile soil rich in organic matter. This plant is one of the S. American species of potatoes. It is not frost hardy but can probably be grown in much the same way as potatoes are grown by planting out the tubers in spring and harvesting in the autumn[K]. It is cultivated for its tubers in the Andes, there are many named varieties[196]. Plants might have strict daylength requirements and may yield poorly in temperate zones because they need short-days in order to induce tuber-formation[196]. Tubers can be harvested in 3 - 4 months from planting out[200]. Tubers from this species lack a period of dormancy, a useful trait in warmer climates than Britain where 2 - 3 crops can be grown but it makes the plant very problematic for temperate areas[196]. This potato has become popular in the Netherlands because of its resistance to disease[196]. (The report does not say if it is grown there or imported[K].) A diploid species, it probably arose from S. stenotomum through selection for short dormancy[196]. It has been hybridized with the common potato to impart greater heat tolerance to that species[196].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into a fairly rich compost as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on fast. Plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division. Harvest the tubers in autumn after the top-growth has been cut back by frost. Store the tubers in a cool frost-free place overwinter and replant in April.,
