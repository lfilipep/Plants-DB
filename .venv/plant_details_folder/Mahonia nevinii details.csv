13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Mahonia nevinii is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2.4 m (7ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3]. The red fruit has an acid lemony flavour with a firm but juicy texture, it is rather nice raw, especially when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. The fruit can be up to about 6mm in diameter[200], though on specimens we have seen fruiting in Britain the fruit is only 3mm in diameter[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Dysentery  TonicBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,"A green dye is obtained from the roots[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Unlike most members of the genus, this species requires a dry, perfectly drained position in full sun[184], a gritty slightly acid soil is best[200]. It does well in a hot, dry position[166]. Succeeds in a good garden soil[11]. It grows best by a sunny south-facing wall[182]. Plants are not fully hardy in all parts of Britain, they probably tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c when fully dormant[184], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. This species is closely allied to M. haematocarpa and M. fremontii[182]. It hybridizes freely with other members of the genus. Grows and flowers well at the University Botanical Gardens in Oxford[67]. A plant on a south-facing wall at Kew produced a good crop of fruit in 1999[K]. Plants are resistant to honey fungus[88].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11]. Leaf cuttings in the autumn.",
