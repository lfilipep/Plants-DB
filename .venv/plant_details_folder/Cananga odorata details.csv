Other Uses Two types of essential oil are obtained from the flowers, both of which are used to supply the dominant odour note of many perfumes:- Cv. Group 'Ylang-ylang' produces ylang-ylang oil, which has a more subtle perfume. 'Extra' quality ylang-ylang oil is much used in high-class perfumery[ 303 ]. Third grade ylang ylang oil has a harsher, more tenacious odour and, like cananga oil, is mainly used in soaps and toiletries for men[ 303 ]. Cv. Group 'Cananga' yields cananga oil which has a harsher, more tenacious odour[ 303 ]. It can be mixed with coconut oil and used as a hair oil named Macassar oil[ 303 ].

The heartwood is pinkish-buff, yellowish to light gray; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain straight; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is light in weight; not very durable, being vulnerable to termite attack. It is easy to season with little or no degrade. It is said to be easy to work and finishes smoothly. The wood is used locally for general construction, turnery and making canoes, and is also used for making boxes, tea chests and plywood[ 303 , 307 , 316 , 339 ]. It has potential for making small drums and matchsticks[ 303 ]. The wood is sometimes used for fuel[ 339 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"The tree thrives in the more humid lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations below 1,200 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30c, but can tolerate 16 - 34c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 5c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,800mm[ 418 ]. Prefers a fertile, moist but well-drained soil in a sunny position[ 302 , 307 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8[ 418 ]. Trees have escaped from cultivation to become naturalised in some areas[ 307 ]. At sea-level, saplings of cultivated trees flower when 1.5 - 2 years old and 2 metres tall, though at an elevation of 500 metres flowering may start only after 7 years[ 303 ]. Trees can reach full production of essential oils when they are about 10 years old[ 418 ]. Individual trees can produce about 120 kilos of flowers a year, yielding about 350g of essential oil[ 238 ]. A dwarf variety of C. Odorata known as var. Fruticosa (Craib) Sinclair, is a bush 1 - 1.5 metres tall, with frequently supernumerary, very curly petals. It flowers throughout the year, but never sets fruits[ 303 ]. There are two main groups that can be distinguished in cultivated ylang ylang plants:- cv. Group Cananga (forma macrophylla Steenis), flowers are the source of cananga oil; branches perpendicular to the stem; leaves 20 cm x 10 cm; cultivated in Java, Fiji and Samoa[ 303 ]. Cv. Group Ylang-ylang (forma genuina Steenis), the source of ylang-ylang oil; branches more drooping; leaves smaller; probably originating from the Philippines and cultivated throughout the tropics[ 303 ]. When the buds open, the flowers are not yet fragrant and the petals are green and covered with white hairs; the petals enlarge, become glabrous and turn from green to yellow after 15 - 20 days and then the flowers emit their powerful and agreeable odour, discernible at a distance[ 303 ]. Both cultivated and wild trees flower throughout the year, but with marked seasonal peaks after periods of dry weather[ 303 ]. The tree is often pruned to 3 m height to make oil harvesting more easy. Flowers all year round. The flowers are picked early in the morning then the oil is extracted by steam distillation . Ylang-ylang has been cultivated in temperate climates under conservatory conditions.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - Fresh seed germinates erratically, however, after 6-12 months storage the germination rate is higher [303]. Pre-soaking the seed in hot water can increase germination rates[ 303 ]. Plants may be raised in nursery beds, but should be handled with great care during transplanting to avoid damage to the long taproot[ 303 ]. Direct sowing is common and seed is placed 5cm deep in well-cultivated and fertilized planting pits of at least 50cm depth[ 303 ]. Cuttings",
