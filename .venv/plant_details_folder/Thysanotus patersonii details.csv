It tolerates temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. A twining plant, it often trails on the ground if there is no support for it to climb[193]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a fertile well-drained sandy loan in a sunny position[1, 200].",Seed - sow thinly in spring in a sandy compost in a greenhouse[200].
