13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Celastrus angulatus is a deciduous Climber growing to 7.3 m (24ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from November to February. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil[1] but succeeds in most soils so long as they are not too shallow[202]. Succeeds in full or partial shade[188]. Plants flower more freely if their top-growth is in the sun[182]. Requires a humus-rich soil if it is to be at its best[219]. A rampant climber, it requires ample space and is best grown into an old tree[1, 200. It climbs by means of twining and also by the young stems having prickles[182]. Plants do not normally require pruning[219]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants are dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - gather when ripe, store in dry sand and sow February in a warm greenhouse[78]. Three months cold stratification leads to a higher germination rate[113]. Remove the flesh of the fruit since this inhibits germination[113]. Germination rates are usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[188]. Layering in August of the current seasons growth. Takes 12 months[78]. Root cuttings, 6mm thick 25mm long in December. Plant horizontally in pots in a frame[78]."
