24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. One report says that it is possibly worthy of cultivation as an edible plant in cold countries[173]. The plant is likely to be very wind tolerant, probably of maritime exposure, but we do not know what other cultivation requirements it might have.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting out in late spring or early summer. Division can be tried in spring.",
