Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Pyramidal.","Picea glehnii is an evergreen Tree growing to 30 m (98ft 5in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Bog Garden;,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ","Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","catkins - raw or cooked. Used as a flavouring[172]. Immature female cones - cooked. The central portion, when roasted, is sweet and syrupy[172]. Inner bark - dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereals when making bread[172]. An emergency food, it is only used when all else fails. Seed - raw. Too small and fiddly to be worthwhile unless you are desperate[172]. A refreshing tea, rich in vitamin C, can be made from the young shoot tips[172].",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Used for pianos, violins, interiors of buildings etc[46, 61]. It is also valued for its use in the pulp industry to make paper[171].",,"Landscape Uses:Screen, Specimen. Likes abundant moisture at the roots, if grown in drier areas it must be given a deep moist soil[11]. Tolerates poor peaty soils[200]. Succeeds in wet cold and shallow soils but is not very wind-firm in shallow soils[1]. Prefers a pH between 4 to 6[200]. Another report says that it grows wild on very alkaline soils so it might be suitable for cultivation on alkaline soils. Dislikes shade[200]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[11]. Resists wind exposure to some degree[200]. In some upland areas, especially over granitic or other base-poor soils, growth rate and health have been seriously affected by aluminium poisoning induced by acid rain[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Fairly fast growing in Britain, able to average 30cm a year for at least the first 50 years[185]. Another report says that it is not a good grower in Britain[1]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Special Features:Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - stratification will probably improve germination so sow fresh seed in the autumn in a cold frame if possible[80]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[78]. A position in light shade is probably best[78]. Seed should not be allowed to dry out and should be stored in a cool place[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, or be placed in an outdoor nursery bed for a year or so to increase in size. They might need protection from spring frosts. Cuttings of semi-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 8cm long, August in a frame. Protect from frost. Forms roots in the spring[78]. Cuttings of mature terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, September/October in a cold frame. Takes 12 months[78]. Cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, early summer in a frame.
