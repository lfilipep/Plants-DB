22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows well in a sandy freely draining loam[11] . Succeeds in dry soils[11]. Plants tolerate partial shade if they are grown in a perfectly draining lean soil[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is not very hardy in Britain, succeeding outdoors only in the milder areas of the country and tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. It succeeds outdoors at Kew but is shy to flower there[11]. It only flowers well after very hot summers[11, 200]. The plants do not have leaves, but they have very sharp spines which are used instead of the leaves in the function of photosynthesis[188]. The flowers are fragrant[188]. A very slow growing plant[75].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing fresh seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse and stored seed as early in the year as it is received. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Cuttings of mature side shoots of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, early winter in a cold frame. Leave for 18 months before potting up. Good percentage[78].",
