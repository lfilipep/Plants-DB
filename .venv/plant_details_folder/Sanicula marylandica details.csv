0,Sanicula marylandica,Maryland Sanicle,Apiaceae or Umbelliferae,Coming soon,"Although no mention has been seen for this species, the leaves of at least two other members of the genus contain saponins[179]. Although toxic, saponins are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm, they are also destroyed by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Rich woods, meadows and shores[21, 43].","North-eastern and Central N.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Emetic  Expectorant  Miscellany  NervineThe root is astringent, nervine and expectorant[21, 61]. A tea made from the thick root has been used to treat menstrual irregularities, pain, kidney ailments, rheumatism and fevers[222]. A decoction of the root has been used to cause vomiting in order to counteract a poison[257]. It makes a useful gargle for treating sore mouths and throats[21]. The powdered root has also been popularly used to treat intermittent fever and chorea (St. Vitus' Dance)[21]. The root is also poulticed and applied to snakebites[222].",Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Strongly dislikes poor thin soils[31]. Prefers a loamy or calcareous soil[9, 17].","Seed - we have no information for this species but the following notes are for the related S. europaea. Stratification improves the germination rate. If possible sow the seed in the autumn, sow stored seed as early in the year as possible. It is best to sow the seed in situ in a woodland soil under trees If seed is in short supply it is probably wise to sow it in pots of woodland soil in a shady place in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
