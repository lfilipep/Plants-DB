17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it tolerates most soils[200], but prefers a good loamy soil, abundant moisture and full sunlight[11, 200]. Hardy to about -20°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[11]. Plants flower on the previous years wood and any pruning is best done soon after the plant has flowered, aiming to remove the dead flower heads and encourage strong growth from below the flowered portion of the stem[182]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if possible. It is likely to require stratification before it germinates, so stored seed should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as you receive it. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a light sandy soil a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15cm long, October/November in an outdoor frame[200]. Another report says that September is a good time to do this[11]. Division of suckers in early spring[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
