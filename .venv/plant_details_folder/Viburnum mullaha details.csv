13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Viburnum mullaha is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105, 146]. Acid tasting[145, 158, 272].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.",

22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A dye is obtained from the fruit[272].  - moderately hard. The straight branches are used for walking sticks[146, 158, 272].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils but ill-adapted for poor soils and dry situations[1]. Prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. Plants are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200]. Plants are given a hardiness zone of 9 (only tolerating light frosts) in [200], this is a bit surprising since they are found at elevations of up to 3000 metres in the Himalayas. This species is closely related to V. wilsonii[11].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78].",
