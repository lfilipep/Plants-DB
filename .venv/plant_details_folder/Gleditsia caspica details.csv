18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,The seed of several species can be eaten raw or cooked. This species often crops well in this country and so some research into its potential edibility would be desirable[K].,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,
23,Other Uses Description,"The closely related G. sinensis has a saponaceous pulp inside the seed pod that can be used as a soap substitute[11]. It is quite probable that this species can be similarly used[K]. Wood - strong, durable, coarse-grained[82].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Rock garden, Specimen. Easily grown in a loamy soil, requiring a sunny position[11]. Succeeds in most soils[200] including sandy ones[188]. Established plants tolerate drought[1] and atmospheric pollution[200]. This species is often confused in cultivation with the closely related G. sinensis, many of the trees grown under that name are this species[11]. This tree is remarkable for the number and length of the spines growing on its trunk, which makes it the most formidably armed of temperate trees[11]. Trees have a light canopy, they come into leaf late in the spring and drop their leaves in early autumn[200] making them an excellent top storey tree in a woodland garden. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in a greenhouse[78]. The seed should have swollen up, in which case it can be sown, if it has not swollen then soak it for another 24 hours in warm water. If this does not work then file away some of the seed coat but be careful not to damage the embryo[78]. Further soaking should then cause the seed to swell. One it has swollen, the seed should germinate within 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual deep pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors.",
