21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.No specific medicinal uses are reported for this species, but it tree probably has medicinal properties similar to the breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis)[ 303 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Agroforestry Uses: Breadnut can be interplanted with a wide range of crops and plants, such as yam, banana (Musa spp.), coconut (Cocos nucifera), sugarcane, medicinal plants, aroids, ginger, Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia, noni), small fruit trees, and field and vegetable crops such as corn, beans, peanut, tomato, and eggplant[ 303 ]. The large leaves of breadnut provide abundant mulch for the tree and other plants growing beneath the canopy[ 303 ]. Breadnut naturally occurs on frequently flooded river banks, where it helps to stabilize the soil[ 303 ]. The tree is planted in home gardens to provide beneficial shade to other plants. It could also be used as a trellis tree for yam (Dioscorea species)[ 303 ]. Other Uses A sticky, white, milky latex is present in all parts of the tree[ 303 ]. Dried male flowers can be burned to repel mosquitoes and other flying insects[ 303 ]. The wood is light in weight, flexible, and easy to work and carve[ 303 ] It is made into statues, bowls, fishing floats, and other objects[ 303 ]. The wood is fast burning, but generally only older, less productive trees are used for fuel[ 303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Homegarden: Tropical multistrata agroforestry (multi-story combinations of trees, crops, domestic animals in the homestead).,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: Homegarden  Other Systems: Multistrata  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA plant of low to moderate elevations in the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations from sea level to 1,550 metres[ 303 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean maximum temperature of the hottest month is no more than 32 - 38c and the mean minimum temperature of the coolest month is no less than 16 - 18c[ 303 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,300 - 3,800mm with no distinct dry season[ 303 ]. Established plants can grow in full sun, but young plants need 20 - 50% shade[ 303 ]. Grows best in a deep, light, fertile, well drained soil[ 303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.1 - 7.4[ 303 ]. Plants can tolerate waterlogged soils and also periodic inundation of the soil for brief periods[ 303 ]. Plants can withstand strong winds and will re-sprout after sustaining wind damage[ 303 ]. Once established, breadnut trees can withstand a dry season of 3 - 4 months, although they prefer moist conditions. A moderately fast growing tree[ 303 ]. Trees can start producing fruit when 8 - 10 years old[ 303 ]. The tree has a shallow-rooting system, with roots often growing along the ground[ 303 ]. Trees can produce 600-800 fruits in a season."
