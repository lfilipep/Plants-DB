24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained friable sandy loam with leaf mold[1]. Intolerant of heavy clay[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. This species deeply resents root disturbance and cannot be transplanted[60]. Most species are short-lived, dying out after 2 - 3 years, though they usually produce seed prolifically[200]. However, they are very apt to hybridize with other members of the genus and so it becomes difficult to keep a species true to type if more than one is grown in the garden[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. The seed can be slow to germinate[200]. Stored seed can be sown in late winter in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring[200].",
