See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",Salix amplifolia Coville,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,"- raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - raw or cooked. They are not very palatable[172]. The leaves have been used as a flavouring in cooked foods[257].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antidote  Febrifuge  MiscellanyThe leaves have been used as an antidote to shellfish poisoning[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs.

Tolerates maritime exposure[11, 200]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The bark has been used extensively in basket making[257]. s from the inner bark can be twisted into long ropes[226]. The soft roots have been used as a towel to rub down after bathing[257]. An infusion of the roots has been used as a hair wash[257].  - light, soft, close grained[82].

Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[11, 200]. A fast-growing but short-lived species[229]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.
