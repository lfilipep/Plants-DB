24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile moisture retentive soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A rather greedy plant, it is apt to impoverish the soil[1]. There is some confusion over the correct identity of this plant. According to [200] it is a native of Western N. America and grows 50cm tall. According to [72] it is a native of South-eastern N. America and grows 120cm tall. [105] lists this species as a synonym of S. odora. It is quite possible that two species are involved, one of which is a synonym for S. odora. The plant attracts various beneficial insects such as ladybirds, lacewings and hoverflies to the garden, these insects will help to control insect pests in the garden[201, 238]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
