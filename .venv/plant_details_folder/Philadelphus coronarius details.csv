This soap is a very gentle cleaner that does not remove the body's natural oils, but does remove dirt. It is not very effective against oil[K]. The leaves can also be used as a duster and a wood polish[6]. Plants can be grown as a hedge[29].",

The flowers are very aromatic[182] with a strong orange aroma[245]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning, one third of the stems can be cut down to the ground each year in order to promote fresh growth and heavier flowering[202]. Fast growing[202]. Plants are inclined to send up suckers and can form thickets[182]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants can harbour blackfly[202]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best if given 1 months cold stratification[113]. Sow February in a light position in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long side-shoots, July/August in a shaded frame. Plant out in spring. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 15 - 25cm with a heel, December in a sheltered bed outdoors. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in summer. Very easy.",
