18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"eaLeaves - raw or cooked. Used as a flavouring in salads or cooked foods. The sweetly scented leaves can be used in the same ways as spearmint[238]. A good culinary mint, the leaves have an attractive red tinge[244]. A herb tea is made from the fresh or dried leaves[238]. It has a very pleasant and refreshing taste of spearmint, leaving the mouth and digestive system feeling clean[K]. An essential oil from the leaves and flowers is used as a flavouring in sweets, ice cream, drinks etc[[238]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Febrifuge  StomachicRed raripila mint, like many other members of this genus, is often used as a domestic herbal remedy, being valued especially for its antiseptic properties and its beneficial effect on the digestion. Like other members of the genus, it is best not used by pregnant women because large doses can cause an abortion. A tea made from the leaves of most mint species has traditionally been used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, digestive disorders and various minor ailments[222]. The leaves are harvested as the plant comes into flower and can be dried for later use[238]. The essential oil in the leaves is antiseptic, though it is toxic in large doses[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,An essential oil is obtained from the whole plant. Rats and mice intensely dislike the smell of mint. The plant was therefore used in homes as a strewing herb and has also been spread in granaries to keep the rodents off the grain[244].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils and situations so long as the soil is not too dry[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A sunny position is best for production of essential oils, but it also succeeds in partial shade[4]. Prefers partial shade and a slightly acid soil[4, 16]. This species is a hybrid involving M. aquatica x M. arvensis x M. spicata[200]. It has sweetly mint-scented leaves with similar culinary uses to M. spicata. Most mints have fairly aggressive spreading roots and, unless you have the space to let them roam, they need to be restrained by some means such as planting them in containers that are buried in the soil[K]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[24]. A good companion plant for growing near cabbages and tomatoes, helping to keep them free of insect pests[14, 20]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - this hybrid is usually sterile, and even if seed is produced it will not breed true[200]. If you do obtain seed, then it can be sown in spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame. They will quickly become established and can be planted out in the summer."
