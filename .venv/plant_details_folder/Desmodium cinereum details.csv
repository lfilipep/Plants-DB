Used as nitrogen-rich mulch in alley-cropping systems and in contour hedgerows. It is a good carbon farming plant.","Desmodium cinereum is an evergreen Perennial growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Desmodium luteocanescens M.E.Jones. Hedysarum cinereum Kunth. Hedysarum sericeum Mill.

Leaf meal of  D. cinereum gave similar benefits to Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal when fed as a protein supplement to poultryand pigs, and also gave incremental improvements in LWG of sheep when fed as hay.  Nutrient analysis results for  D. cinereum leaf were similar to those for Medicago sativa. Regular cutting stimulates multiple stems and increases yields of leaf.  Nitrogen-rich mulch. Carbon Farming Solutions - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, contour hedgerow, understory legume (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland). : bank [1-1].","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Bank  Management: Fodder  Minor Global CropClimate: tropical highlands. Humidity: humid. Adapted to the wet tropics with more than 1500 mm average annual rainfall and a short, or no dry season. Lowland species found at altitudes between 0-1000m. Requires a mean annual temperature in excess of 20°C and has no frost tolerance. Found on moderately fertile, neutral or slightly acid soils. Becomes chlorotic in alkaline soil [415] . Fast growing but short lived. Regular cutting stimulates multiple stems and increases yields of leaf.  If seed production is required, defoliation must be timed to avoid destroying the developing seed crop. Reported to be a high quality feed supplement for ruminants in southeast Asia [415].
