See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",G. epiphyta.

A peat and moisture loving species, it requires a lime-free soil[11, 182]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, they are only likely to succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. A polymorphic species, it is very variable in leaf size and shape[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. Pre-chill for 4 - 10 weeks and then surface sow in a lime-free compost in a shady part of the greenhouse and keep the compost moist[78]. The seed usually germinates well, usually within 1 - 2 months at 20°c, but the seedlings are liable to damp off. It is important to water them with care and to ensure that they get plenty of ventilation. Watering them with a garlic infusion can also help to prevent damping of[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are about 25mm tall and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. The seedlings are susceptible to spring frosts so might need some protection for their first few years outdoors. The leaves remain very small for the first few years[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 3 - 6cm long, July/August in a frame in a shady position. They form roots in late summer or spring[78]. A good percentage usually take. Division in spring just before new growth begins[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Layering.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
