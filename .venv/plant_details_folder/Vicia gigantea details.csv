They are eaten, when young, like green peas[2, 105, 118, 161], the flavour even of young seeds is rather strong, like old garden peas[256]. Some native North American Indian tribes regarded the seeds as poisonous, though other tribes would eat them as a snack. The pods were harvested when green and then roasted in an open fire until the pods started to split open. The seeds were then removed and eaten[256].",

25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a fairly heavy loam but succeeds in a sunny position in most soils that are well-drained[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils.",
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in spring or autumn.,
