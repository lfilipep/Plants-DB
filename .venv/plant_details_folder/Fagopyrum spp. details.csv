See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",See individual species.,,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[105, 160, 272]. Boiled or steamed and used like spinach[183]. Of excellent quality according to one report[2], but we have been less than impressed by the flavour, which has a distinct bitterness especially when eaten raw[K]. The leaves are rich in rutin (see below for details of its uses) and so they do make a healthy addition to the diet[K]. Seed - it can be sprouted and eaten raw, or cooked and used as a cereal[4]. Dried and ground into a powder, it can serve as a thickening agent in soups etc. The seed is rich in vitamin B6. Unfortunately, it is not freely produced in Britain[2].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The whole plant is anodyne, anthelmintic, antiphlogistic, carminative, depurative and febrifuge. It stimulates blood circulation[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of traumatic injuries, lumbago, menstrual irregularities, purulent infections, snake and insect bites[147]. A decoction of the roots is used in the treatment of insect bites, dysmenorrhoea, inflammation, lumbago, snakebite and traumatic injuries[218]. The leaves are rich in rutin which is a capillary tonic, antioedemic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic and hypotensive[218]. Rutin also inhibits carcinogenesis and protects against radiation[218].",,"Animal feed, An ornamental plant.","Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",Hypothetical Crop  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carbClimate: boreal to cold temperate.

Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division is very easy at almost any time in the growing season, though it is best avoided in early spring because the young growth can be damaged by late frosts. The divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
