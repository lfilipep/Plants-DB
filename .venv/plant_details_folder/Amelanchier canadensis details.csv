13,Summary,"Bloom Color: White.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Amelanchier canadensis is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Edible fruit - raw or cooked[3, 55, 101, 159]. The fruit contains a few small seeds at the centre, it has a sweet flavour with a hint of apple[1, 2]. It can be eaten out of hand, used in pies, preserves etc or dried and used like raisins[183]. We have found the fruit to be of variable quality, with some forms having a distinct bitterness in the flavour whilst others are sweet, juicy and delicious[K]. When the fruit is thoroughly cooked in puddings or pies the seed imparts an almond flavour to the food[183]. The fruit is rich in iron and copper[226]. It is about 10mm in diameter[200]. Trees can yield 7 to 15 tonnes per hectare[160].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Disinfectant  Women's complaintsA tea made from the root bark (mixed with other unspecified herbs) was used as a tonic in the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding and also to treat diarrhoea[222, 257]. A bath of the bark tea was used on children with worms[222, 257]. An infusion of the root was used to prevent miscarriage after an injury[257]. A compound concoction of the inner bark was used as a disinfectant wash[257].",
22,Other Uses,"Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"This species can be used as a dwarfing rootstock for Malus spp. (the apples) and Pyrus spp. (the pears)[160]. Plants can be grown as an informal hedge[200]. Any trimming is best done after flowering[200]. A fairly wind-tolerant species, it can be used to give protection from the wind as part of a mixed shelterbelt[200].  - hard, strong, close grained. Used for tool handles, small implements etc[46, 61].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a rich loamy soil in a sunny position or semi-shade[1, 200] but thrives in any soil that is not water-logged, too dry or poor[11], though it is more wet-tolerant than other members of this genus[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers an acid soil[17, 43]. Trees produce more and better quality fruits better when growing in a sunny position[1]. All members of this genus have edible fruits and, whilst this is dry and uninteresting in some species, in many others it is sweet and juicy. Many of the species have potential for use in the garden as edible ornamentals. The main draw-back to this genus is that birds adore the fruit and will often completely strip a tree before it is fully ripe[K]. There is at least one named variety of this species with superior fruits. 'Prince William' is a large multi-stemmed shrub to 3 metres tall and 2 metres across[183, 200]. It crops heavily and its good quality fruit is about 12mm in diameter[183]. Considerable confusion has existed between this species and A. arborea, A. laevis and A. lamarckii, see [11] for the most recent (1991) classification. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Grafting onto seedlings of A. lamarckii or Sorbus aucuparia is sometimes practised in order to avoid the potential problem of hybridizing[1].  Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Attracts butterflies, Blooms are very showy. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it is best harvested 'green', when the seed is fully formed but before the seed coat has hardened, and then sown immediately in pots outdoors or in a cold frame. If stored seed is obtained early enough in the autumn, it can be given 4 weeks warm stratification before being left out in the winter and it should then germinate in the spring. Otherwise seed can be very slow to germinate, perhaps taking 18 months or more. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a sheltered outdoor position, planting them out once they are 20cm or more tall. If there is sufficient seed it is best to sow it thinly in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Grow the seedlings on for two years in the seedbed before planting them out into their permanent positions during the winter. Layering in spring - takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in late winter. The suckers need to have been growing for 2 years before you dig them up, otherwise they will not have formed roots. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions if required.",
