0,Borago officinalis,"Borage, Common borage,Cool-tankard, Tailwort",Boraginaceae,6-9,"The plant, but not the oil obtained from the seeds, contains small amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can cause liver damage and liver cancer[238]. These alkaloids are present in too small a quantity to be harmful unless you make borage a major part of your diet, though people with liver problems would be wise to avoid using the leaves or flowers of this plant[K].",Waste ground near houses in Britain[17].,C.

Form: Irregular or sprawling.","Borago officinalis is a ANNUAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to October, and the seeds ripen from July to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.","Borago advena, Borago aspera, Borago hortensis",Hedgerow; Cultivated Beds; South Wall. In. West Wall.

They can be used as a pot-herb or be added to salads[4]. They are also added whole as a flavouring to various drinks such as Pimms and wine-based drinks[238]. The leaves are rich in potassium and calcium, they have a salty cucumber flavour[200]. Very hairy, the whole leaves have an unpleasant feeling in the mouth and so they are best chopped up finely and added to other leaves when eaten in a salad[K]. The leaves should always be used fresh, because they lose their flavour and colour if dried[244]. Flowers - raw. They are used as a decorative garnish on salads and summer fruit drinks[2, 5, 7, 14, 183]. The flowers are very nice, both to look at and to taste with a sweet slightly cucumber-like flavour[K]. A refreshing tea is made from the leaves and/or the flowers[21, 183]. The dried stems are used for flavouring beverages[183]. The seed yields 30% oil, 20% of which is gamma-linolenic acid[141]. Total yields are 0.35 - 0.65 tonnes per hectare[141]. Unfortunately, the seed ripens intermittently over a period of time and falls from the plant when it is ripe, this makes harvesting the seeds in quantity very difficult[K]. An edible blue dye can be obtained from the flowers. It is used to colour vinegar[183].","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Lenitive: Soothing, palliative.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It has a particularly good reputation for its beneficial affect on the mind, being used to dispel melancholy and induce euphoria[244]. It is a soothing saline, diuretic herb that soothes damaged or irritated tissues[238]. The leaves, and to a lesser extent the flowers, are demulcent, diaphoretic, depurative, mildly diuretic, emollient, expectorant, febrifuge, lenitive and mildly sedative[4, 7, 9, 14, 201, 238]. An infusion is taken internally in the treatment of a range of ailments including fevers, chest problems and kidney problems[4], though it should not be prescribed to people with liver problems. Externally it is used as a poultice for inflammatory swellings[4, 7]. The leaves are harvested in late spring and the summer as the plant comes into flower. They can be used fresh or dried but should not be stored for more than one year because they soon lose their medicinal properties[238]. The seeds are a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid, this oil helps to regulate the hormonal systems and lowers blood pressure[238]. It is used both internally and externally, helping to relieve skin complaints and pre-menstrual tension[238]. Used for the treatment of phlebitis (inflammation of the veins) [301].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The growing plant is said to repel insects[14]. A blue dye is obtained from the flowers[7]. This turns pink on contact with acids[238].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Massing. A very easily grown plant, succeeding in ordinary garden soil[1], preferring a dry soil[37] and a sunny position[138]. It grows particularly well in loose, stony soils with some chalk and sand[244]. Plants are tolerant of poor dry soils, though much bigger specimens are produced when the plants are growing in better conditions[238]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.8 to 8.3. Borage is often grown as a culinary plant in the herb garden[1, 7]. Although an annual, it usually maintains itself by self-sowing, sometimes in quite a prolific manner, as long as the soil is disturbed by hoeing etc[14, 188]. Plants often develop mildew when growing in dry conditions or towards the end of the growing season[238]. Flowers are a deeper blue when grown in poorer soils[138]. The flowers are rich in a sweet nectar and are very attractive to bees[7, 14, 20, 108, 244]. The growing plant is a good companion for strawberries, tomatoes, courgettes and most other plants[14, 201, 238]. It is said to deter Japanese beetle and tomato hornworms[238].  Special Features:Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Suitable for dried flowers, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. A self-seeding annual [1-2].","Seed - sow April/May in situ. The plants quickly develop a stout tap-root and do not transplant successfully[238]. The seed can also be sown in situ in the autumn, this will produce larger plants and earlier flowering[4].
