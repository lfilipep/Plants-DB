22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most well-drained soils, including dry ones, preferring a sunny position[111, 200]. Dislikes shade and wet soils[124, 200]. Plants only really thrive when they are grown on chalky soils[200]. Prefers a light soil[200]. This species is fairly reliably perennial[200], but only when grown on light or medium soils[111]. A very ornamental plant, it often self-sows[1, 111]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus, though the progeny are usually sterile[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late spring to early summer in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in late summer. The seed has a long viability[200]. Division in spring. This plant is a short-lived perennial that grows away very well from seed, so we do not try and divide it.",
