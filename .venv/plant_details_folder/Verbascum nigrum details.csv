Dislikes shade and wet soils[124, 200]. Plants only really thrive when they are grown on chalky soils[200]. Prefers a light soil[200]. This species is fairly reliably perennial[200], but only when grown on light or medium soils[111]. A very ornamental plant, it often self-sows[1, 111]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus, though the progeny are usually sterile[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow late spring to early summer in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in late summer. The seed has a long viability[200]. Division in spring. This plant is a short-lived perennial that grows away very well from seed, so we do not try and divide it.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
