See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Cultivated Beds;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","eaThe rootstock is used as a flavouring[102], it is a substitute for sarsaparilla[43] and is also used for making 'root beer'[183]. It is also used as an emergency food[177] (usually mixed with oil[257]), having a sweet spicy taste and a pleasant aromatic smell[4]. A nutritious food[207], it was used by the Indians during wars or when they were hunting since it is very sustaining[213]. Young shoots - cooked as a potherb[207]. A refreshing herbal tea is made from the root[183]. Pleasantly flavoured[222, 238]. The roots are boiled in water until the water is reddish-brown[256]. A jelly is made from the fruit[207]. The fruit is also used to make wine[257]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200]. The fruit is a round, purplish-black berry.","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Homeopathy  Pectoral  StimulantWild sarsaparilla is a sweet pungent tonic herb that acts as an alterative. It had a wide range of traditional uses amongst the North American Indians and was at one time widely used as a substitute for the tropical medicinal herb sarsaparilla[222, 257]. The root is alterative, diaphoretic, diuretic, pectoral and stimulant[4, 21, 213, 222]. The herb encourages sweating, is stimulating and detoxifying and so is used internally in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, asthma, rheumatism, stomach aches etc[4, 213, 238, 254, 257]. Externally it is used as a poultice in treating rheumatism, sores, burns, itchy skin, ulcers and skin problems such as eczema[4, 222, 254]. The root is collected in late summer and the autumn and dried for later use[4, 213]. A drink made from the pulverised roots is used as a cough treatment[213]. A poultice made from the roots and/or the fruit is applied to sores, burns, itchy skin, ulcers, swellings etc[213, 222]. A homeopathic remedy made from the roots is important in the treatment of cystitis[238].",,Groundcover. Wildlife - food source. A specialist nectary plant [1-2].,,"Prefers a good deep loam and a semi-shady position[1, 134]. Requires a sheltered position[1]. Plants are hardier when grown in poorer soils[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 4 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are 25cm or more tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, late spring or early summer being the best time to do this. Root cuttings 8cm long, December in a cold frame[11, 78]. Store the roots upside down in sand and pot up in March/April. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in late winter[11]. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
