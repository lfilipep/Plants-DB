25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200]. Prefers a pH of 5.5 to 7[200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 7.5. Prefers a cool moist reasonably fertile soil[52]. The plant is shallow rooted and intolerant of drought, it needs to be grown in a moist fertile soil for the best quality leaves[206]. Plants are not tremendously cold-hardy, though they will withstand light frosts[133]. Pak choi is widely cultivated, especially in China, for its edible leaves which are produced mainly in the summer and autumn. A fast-growing plant, there are many named varieties and some can be ready in as little as five weeks from sowing the seed[88, 206, 264]. Forms with green stems tend to stand up better to adverse conditions than white-stemmed forms[206].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ May to August. Spring sown crops are prone to run quickly to seed if there is a spell of cold weather[206]. Some varieties can also be sown in a cold greenhouse in autumn or early spring to provide leaves overwinter and in late spring.,
