18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Industrial Crop: Pesticide: Many plants provide natural pesticides.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."

20,Medicinal Uses,"Adaptogen: Helps the body ,Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Stings: Used in the treatment of stings and insect bites.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI)."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Adaptogen  Alterative  Antiseptic  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Digestive  Sialagogue  Stings  UrinaryEchinacea is one of the world's most important medicinal herbs. Research shows that it has the ability to raise the body's resistance to bacterial and viral infections by stimulating the immune system[254]. It is also antibiotic and helps to relieve allergies[254]. Plants in this genus were probably the most frequently used of all North American Indian herbal remedies. They had a very wide range of applications and many of these uses have been confirmed by modern science. The plant has a general stimulatory effect on the immune system and is widely used in modern herbal treatments[222]. There has been some doubt over the ability of the body to absorb the medicinally active ingredients orally (intravenous injections being considered the only effective way to administer the plant), but recent research has demonstrated significant absorption from orally administered applications[222]. In Germany over 200 pharmaceutical preparations are made from Echinacea[222]. The roots and the whole plant are considered particularly beneficial in the treatment of sores, wounds, burns etc, possessing cortisone-like and antibacterial activity[222]. The plant was used by North American Indians as a universal application to treat the bites and stings of all types of insects[213]. An infusion of the plant was also used to treat snakebites[213]. The root is adaptogen, alterative, antiseptic, depurative, digestive, sialagogue[4, 21, 61, 165]. It is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238]. The plant has been used as a diaphoretic[213]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Echinacea for common cold, cough and bronchitis, fevers and cold, urinary tract infections, inflammation of the mouth and pharynx, increase resistance to infection, wounds and burns (see [302] for critics of commission E)."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,Attracts butterflies and beneficial insects including parasitic Wasps. General insect (especially bees) nectar plant. Butterfly nectar plant. Shelter plant for beneficial insects.  Wildlife Food – seed-eating birds - a favorite of the American Goldfinch). Pioneer Plant – helps reestablish overused or damaged land. Drought Plant – this species can tolerate prolonged dry conditions once established.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep rich loam with plenty of leafmold[1] and a sunny position[175]. Closely related to E. pallida and included in that species by some botanists[274]. Slugs love this plant[K]. USDA Hardiness Zone: Zone 3-8. AHS Heat Zone: 9-1 In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[175, K]. Diurnal temperature fluctuations aid germination[175]. The seed usually germinates in 10 - 21 days at 25°c[175]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for the first summer. Plant them out in the late spring or early summer of the following year and give them some protection from slugs at least until they are established[K]. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings, October in a frame[200]."
