22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most fertile soils but they must be perfectly drained and the plant requires a very sunny position[200]. Very intolerant of winter wet, especially when grown on its own roots[200]. It can be grafted onto Caragana or Laburnum species[200]. Plants are well adapted to maritime situations, growing well on alkaline, sandy and saline soils[200]. Another report says that the plant is unable to thrive in any soil that contains lime[245]. The flowers have a delicate sweet almond perfume[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in a greenhouse. Use a very well drained compost and be very careful not to overwater, the seedlings are very susceptible to a wet soil[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very difficult. Layering[200]"
