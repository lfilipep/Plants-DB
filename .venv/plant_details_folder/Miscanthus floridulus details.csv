24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Erosion control, Seashore, Specimen, Winter interest. Prefers a deep fertile loamy soil that does not dry out in summer[200] but it also succeeds in any ordinary soil that is not too dry[1, 162], in sun or light shade[200]. Plants can be grown as a focal point in lawns, they also succeed in quite coarse grass[233]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. This species is closely related to M. sacchariflorus[233]. The leaves have saw-toothed edges that can cut the unwary gardener, it is best to wear gloves when working with the plant[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a greenhouse and keep moist. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or early autumn[200]. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
