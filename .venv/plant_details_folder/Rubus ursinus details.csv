25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. This species is the parent of many hybrid cultivated forms[71], including the loganberry and the primus berry[183]. Some botanists include the cultivated loganberry (treated here as a separate species, R. loganobaccus) under this species[200]. This species is a blackberry with biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification, is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed as early as possible in the year in a cold frame and stratify for a month at 3°c if sowing later than February. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring."
