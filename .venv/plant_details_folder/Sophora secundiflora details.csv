22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Rather slow-growing and difficult to transplant[227]. A very ornamental plant[274]. This species has not been tried outdoors in Britain, it is possibly hardy if grown in the sunniest mildest areas of the country, or against a sunny wall in less mild areas[11]. It grows best in the warmer areas of the country where the wood will be more readily ripened and better able to withstand winter cold[219]. Plants should be container-grown and planted out whilst young, older plants do not transplant well[219]. The flowers have a powerful and delicious fragrance[82, 200], though some people find them offensive[227]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in hot (not boiling) water and sow in late winter in a greenhouse[78]. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into individual pots in the greenhouse, and grow them on for 2 years under protected conditions. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their third year. Cuttings of young shoots with a heel, July/August in a frame[11]. Air-layering[200]."
