The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.

Virgilia secundiflora.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,None known,"Hallucinogenic: Causes the mind to hallucinate.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Hallucinogenic  NarcoticHallucinogenic, narcotic[82, 161, 192]. An infusion of the seeds is used[192, 200], half a seed is enough to produce intoxication[192]. An infusion of the ground up seed has also been applied to ears in the treatment of earaches[213, 257]. The seeds contain the highly poisonous alkaloid cytosine (or sophorine) - this substance is related to nicotine and acts violently in the human system[213].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Landscape Uses: Border, Espalier, Pest tolerant, Massing, Standard, Specimen, Street tree.

Succeeds in a hot dry position. Rather slow-growing and difficult to transplant[227]. A very ornamental plant[274]. This species has not been tried outdoors in Britain, it is possibly hardy if grown in the sunniest mildest areas of the country, or against a sunny wall in less mild areas[11]. It grows best in the warmer areas of the country where the wood will be more readily ripened and better able to withstand winter cold[219]. Plants should be container-grown and planted out whilst young, older plants do not transplant well[219]. The flowers have a powerful and delicious fragrance[82, 200], though some people find them offensive[227]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in hot (not boiling) water and sow in late winter in a greenhouse[78]. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into individual pots in the greenhouse, and grow them on for 2 years under protected conditions. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their third year. Cuttings of young shoots with a heel, July/August in a frame[11].
