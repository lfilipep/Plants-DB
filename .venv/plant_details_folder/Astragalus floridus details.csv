0,Astragalus floridus,Duo Hua Huang Qi,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,Coming soon,Many members of this genus contain toxic glycosides[65]. All species with edible seedpods can be distinguished by their fleshy round or oval seedpod that looks somewhat like a greengage[85]. A number of species can also accumulate toxic levels of selenium when grown in soils that are relatively rich in that element[65].,Forests and alpine meadows at elevations of 3800-4400 metres in the Himalayan regions of Sikkim and western China[266].,E. Asia - Himalayas.,(0 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Well drained soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Astragalus floridus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,"Antihydrotic: Reduces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antihydrotic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  TonicThe entire plant is used in Tibetan medicine, it is said to have a sweet taste and a heating potency[241]. Antihydrotic, diuretic, emmenagogue and tonic, it is used in the treatment of body weakness from prolonged illness, renal inflammation from lack of exercise, lack of appetite, excessive perspiration (especially when asleep), diabetes, boils/sores, diarrhoea, irregular menses and vaginal/seminal discharge[241].",,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. Whilst it is likely to tolerate low temperatures it may not be so happy with a wet winter. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a dry well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. Succeeds in poor soils[200]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and are best planted in their final positions whilst still small[200]. This plant is a sub-shrub and although it produces woody stems these tend to die back almost to the base each winter. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Many members of this genus can be difficult to grow, this may be due partly to a lack of their specific bacterial associations in the soil[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate[200]. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed[134, 200]. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours[134, 200]. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh[134]. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
