22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils[11], and growing well on chalk[200]. It succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[188]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], but it is slow to become established[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it normally germinates in spring. The germination rate is variable but usually good[78]. 'Green' seed, harvested when the embryo has fully formed but before the outer coat has dried, sown immediately in a cold frame germinates very well. Stored seed requires stratification, 3 months warm then 5 months cold usually works well but germination can take 18 months[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
