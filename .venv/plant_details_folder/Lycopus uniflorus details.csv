This species might be no more than a synonym for L. virginicus, a species known to be hardy in Britain. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Tolerates most soil types so long as they are wet. Succeeds in damp meadows or in wet places by ponds or streams[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].","Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame[238]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring or autumn[238]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
