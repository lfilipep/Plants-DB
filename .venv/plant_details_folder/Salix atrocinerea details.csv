See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",S. oleifera.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,None known,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Dysentery  FebrifugeThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226]. The bark of this species is used interchangeably with S. alba. It is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, gout, inflammatory stages of auto-immune diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, feverish illnesses, neuralgia and headache[238]. The bark is removed during the summer and dried for later use[238]. The leaves are used internally in the treatment of minor feverish illnesses and colic[238]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238].","Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.","Plants have an extensive root system and are used to stabilize waste tips and old slag heaps[199]. Plants are very hardy and wind-resistant, they form an excellent wind-break without any tendency to die back[199].",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A relatively slow-growing but extremely durable plant when growing in very exposed positions[199]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
