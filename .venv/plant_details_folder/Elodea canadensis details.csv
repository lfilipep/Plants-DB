22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A floating, submerged plant, growing well in slowly-moving water and also succeeding in ponds[257]. Plants grow more vigorously when able to root into the mud of the pond[200]. This species, when first introduced into British waterways in the mid nineteenth century, spread rapidly to become a great peat, blocking many waterways[17]. It then seemed to lose its vigour and is now widespread but seldom abundant[17]. Most of the plants grown in Britain are a female clone[17]. Plants perennate by means of overwintering buds that sink to the bottom of the pond in the autumn and then commence growing in the spring."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - seldom produced in Britain, if it is obtained it should not be allowed to dry out and is best sown immediately in water. Division can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season. Simply break off a bit of plant and place in water - it will soon produce roots. The stem can be weighted with something like a stone and then thrown into a pond to allow the stems to root into the mud."
