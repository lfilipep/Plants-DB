21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antidote  Antitussive  Dysentery  Febrifuge  StomachicThe leaves are antidiarrhoeal, febrifuge and stomachic[ 310 ]. An infusion is used as a remedy for stomach problems, dysentery and coughs[ 310 , 345 ]. The root is considered an antidote against plant-based poisoning and an alterative in cachexia and syphilis[ 310 , 345 ]. Furthermore, it is traditionally used to stop the haemorrhaging resulting from the bite of the viper Echis carinatus[ 310 ] The roots are reported to be ingested to clean the body after childbirth[ 310 ]. The plant has been shown to contain a range of medically active constituents. The leaves contain rosmarinic acid, flavonoid glycosides and triterpenoids[ 310 ]. Rosmarinic acid, a phenylacrylic acid derivative, is a known inhibitor of histamine release and a methanol extract of the leaves has shown strong antihistamine release properties[ 310 ]. In an experiment in the Philippines, tablets from the dried leaves reduced the formation of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induced by mitomycin C, tetracycline, and dimethylnitrosamine. This suggests that these tablets possess antimutagenic activity[ 310 ] The root bark contains ehretianone, microphyllone and ehretianone[ 310 ]. Ehretianone, a quinonoid xanthene, has been shown to give protection against the action of snake venom[ 310 ]. Microphyllone and ehretianone have shown antibacterial activity against a panel of bacteria[ 310 ]. Many membes of this genus contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids and quinoid or phenolic compounds[ 310 ].",
