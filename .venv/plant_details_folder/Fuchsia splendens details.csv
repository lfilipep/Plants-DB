19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[105, 166]. A juicy berry[K], it is tart with a peppery after-taste[104]. This is the nicest fuchsia fruit we have eaten as yet, its flavour is somewhat lemon-like with no noticed aftertaste, our 12 month old child was ecstatic about them, eating them in quantity[K]. A very agreeable flavour[104]. The fruit can be up to 40mm long and 8mm wide[200].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil[200]. Succeeds in a good loam if sand and leafmold are added[1]. A very adaptable plant, it tolerates the heavy shade of a north-facing wall and also a position in full sun, though the foliage is apt to be somewhat pale when plants grow in full sun[104]. This species is only hardy in the mildest parts of Britain, doing well in Cornwall and S. Devon[104, 166]. A plant at Trengwainton in Cornwall growing out of a shady wall was about 2 metres tall and fruiting heavily in early August 1995[K]. Plants can be cut back to the ground by even quite light frosts but they usually recover well, resprouting from the base in late spring[K]. Plants require greenhouse protection in most parts of Britain[1]. Plants are very susceptible to whitefly[188]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K].",
