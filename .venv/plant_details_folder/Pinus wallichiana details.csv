Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Pyramidal.","Pinus wallichiana is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",P. chylla. P. excelsa. non Lamb. P. griffithii. non Parl.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","- raw or cooked[183]. It has a very resinous flavour and so is not much relished[158]. The seed is quite small, to 7mm long[200]. The honeydew from aphid infested leaves is eaten as a manna[51, 146, 158]. Another report says that a manna-like substance that exudes from the leaves and twigs is eaten or used like honey[183]. A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Rubefacient  Stimulant  VermifugeThe turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. The wood is diaphoretic and stimulant[240]. It is useful in treating burning of the body, cough, fainting and ulcers[240].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Pitch: Used for waterproofing, in paints etc.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A commercial source of turpentine and tar. It is said to be superior to P. roxburghii but not produced so freely[64, 146, 158]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4].  can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc. The leaves are used as a stuffing for pillows etc[158]. A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201].  - moderately hard, durable, highly resinous. Used in construction, carpentry etc[46, 51, 146, 158, 272]. A good firewood but it gives off a pungent resinous smoke[51]. The wood is rich in resin. It can be splintered and used as a torch[145, 158].","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional CropLandscape Uses:Specimen. Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils or shade[1, 11]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. Prefers sandy or clay soils rather than limestone[146]. A very hardy but relatively short-lived tree in cultivation[11]. The Himalayan blue pine succeeds in exposed positions but it looks much better when grown in a sheltered position[11, 81]. It is a very fast growing tree when young, with new shoots up to 1metre long per year[11] and 30 year old trees 20 metres tall. New growth takes place from April to mid-July[185]. Growth in height diminishes rapidly when trees are 25 metres tall, probably due to their dislike of exposure at that height[185]. Cultivated for timber in Italy[50]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Cones open and shed their seed whilst still on the tree[1]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
