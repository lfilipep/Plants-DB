24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in most soils[167]. Succeeds in dry soils[200]. Resists maritime exposure[154]. This species is not very hardy in mainland Britain, it succeeds outdoors on the Scilly Isles but usually requires greenhouse protection elsewhere. A polymorphic species[1]. Planted for shelter in Portugal, especially by the coast, and it is locally naturalized there[50]. There is some confusion over this name. Most of the entries on this record were listed under M. serratum, which is listed here as a synonym of this species. However, [154] says that M. serratum is a synonym of M. insulare, which has been treated here as a separate and distinct species."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn. Good percentage[78]."
