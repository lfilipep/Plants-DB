22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a fertile well-drained soil in full sun or part-day shade[200]. Plants flower in their first year from seed and, although they are not very hardy in Britain, they can either be grown as half-hardy annuals or the tubers can be harvested in the autumn and stored overwinter in a cool frost-free place in much the same manner as dahlias[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed remains viable for several years[196]. Division in spring as the plant comes into growth[200]."
