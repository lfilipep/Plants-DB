See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - cooked. We were supplied this plant by a friend who said that the root is edible. We have not seen any reports on its edibility. The raw root is crisp and pleasant when first put in the mouth, but soon degenerates into a mucilaginous mass described by some people as 'like eating catarrh' and in rather less flattering terms by others![K]. When well baked, the root loses this quality and is quite pleasant to eat[K]. Leaves cooked. Used as a spinach[264].","Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. This plant seldom, if ever, produces seeds[266]. We have very little information on this plant. The top growth is almost certainly not frost-hardy, though plants have continued growing in a polyhouse when other sensitive plants have died back as a result of frost damage[K]. The tubers have also survived outdoors in a sunny sheltered position for three winters outdoors (as of May 2004), the plant coming back into growth in late spring[K]. )The roots are likely to be hardier and, especially if well mulched, should survive most winters outdoors in the milder areas of the country. They are unlikely to survive sharp or persistent frosts. It should be possible to harvest the roots in the autumn after the top growth has been killed by frost and then store them in a cool but frost-free place for the winter, planting out in late spring (perhaps starting them off in a greenhouse beforehand)[K]. A climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around the thin branches of other plants[K].","Seed - we have no information on this plant, but, if seed can be obtained, suggest sowing it in a greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings. Division. Dig up the tubers at any time from late autumn to early spring. Store them in a cool but frost-free place and either pot them up in the greenhouse in early spring or plant them directly outside in late spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
