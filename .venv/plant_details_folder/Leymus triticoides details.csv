The plant has extensively creeping rhizomes and often forms large clumps in the wild[236]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most soils, preferring a sandy soil and a sunny position[1, 162].","Seed - sow mid spring in situ and only just cover the seed[162]. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If the supply of seed is limited, it can also be sown in mid spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in summer[K] Division in spring or summer[162]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
