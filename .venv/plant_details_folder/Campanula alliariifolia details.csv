23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown for ground cover when planted about 45cm apart each way, they form spreading clumps[208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained fertile soil[233], but prefers a moist well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun, though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. When grown in exposed and windy positions, plants tend to grow better when in a poor soil[271]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. If the plant is cut back as the flowers fade, it will usually produce a second flush of flowers later in the season[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. This species tends to produce seed abundantly in cultivation and will often self-sow[221, 271]. Plants can be naturalized in the light dappled shade of a woodland[200]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. The plant has a thick fleshy root with a number of crowns. Whilst this can be divided if great care is taken not to damage the root, it is not really recommended because the divisions take a long time to become established[221].",
