0,Campanula alliariifolia,Cornish Bellflower,Campanulaceae,3-7,None known,"Open scrub and conifer forests, occasionally on cliffs but frequently on steep banks[271]. Naturalized on banks and rough ground, especially by railways, in southern England.","E. Europe to W. Asia. Naturalized in Britain, in Cornwall.",(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CampanulaAlliariifolia.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CampanulaAlliariifolia2.jpg",,"Campanula alliariifolia is a deciduous Perennial growing to 0.7 m (2ft 4in) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf from April to November, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[K]. The leaves are rather hairy and, especially as they age, have a slightly unpleasant bitterness. They are acceptable as a minor ingredient in mixed salads, but are generally less than pleasant to eat on their own[K]. Flowers - a pleasant taste and texture with a slight sweetness[208].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Plants can be grown for ground cover when planted about 45cm apart each way, they form spreading clumps[208].",,"Succeeds in any well-drained fertile soil[233], but prefers a moist well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun, though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. When grown in exposed and windy positions, plants tend to grow better when in a poor soil[271]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. If the plant is cut back as the flowers fade, it will usually produce a second flush of flowers later in the season[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. This species tends to produce seed abundantly in cultivation and will often self-sow[221, 271]. Plants can be naturalized in the light dappled shade of a woodland[200]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. The plant has a thick fleshy root with a number of crowns. Whilst this can be divided if great care is taken not to damage the root, it is not really recommended because the divisions take a long time to become established[221].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
