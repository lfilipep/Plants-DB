13,Summary,"Indigofera suffruticosa,commonly known in various names such as Guatemala indigo, small-leaved indigo, West Indian indigo, wild indigo, anil indigo, and anil de pasto, is a flowering plant growing up to 1 m tall which can be found in South America. it is an erect and branching shrub with pinnate leaves. The rootstock are woody while the stems are often woody but can also be herbaceous. It has been known as 'the king of dyes' due to its fascinating deep blue color. Medicinally, Anil indigo is applied to the bee and other insects stings to reduce pain and inflammation. Root decoction is used against stomach pain. The leaves are used for fever, and scrofula when combined with the bark of Philodendron chinense. Plant juice is used as a treatment for diarrhea."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Indigofera suffruticosa is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

18,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.

19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antiinflammatory  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  VermifugeThe plant finds some use in domestic medicine in Guatemala. Indigo is often applied to the stings of bees and other insects to reduce pain and inflammation, although its efficacy is somewhat doubtful[331 ]. A decoction of the roots is taken against stomach-ache[310 ]. A tincture of the roots and seeds in rum is used as a vermifuge[310 ]. The leaves are resolutive and sudorific[348 ]. An infusion of bruised leaves is used as a treatment for fever[310 ]. Combined with the leaves of Indigofera tinctoria and the bark of Phellodendron chinense, it is used as a medicine against scrofula[310 ]. The fresh leaves are used in a warm bath to act as a calmative[348 ]. The plant juice is used as a treatment for diarrhoea[310 ]."
20,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil."
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Grown as a cover crop and green manure in coffee, rubber and tea plantations[310 ]. In South America it is one of the components of natural pastures developing after clearing rain forest[310 ]. A good cover of the plant can increase the nitrogen content of the soil considerably. In Sri Lanka for example, an increase from 3.7% to 5.3% in 4 years was found[310 ]. Other Uses: The plant is a major source of the blue dye indigo[331 ]. Plants contain the glucoside indican, which transforms into indoxyl (indigo-white) and glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis[310 ]. Indoxyl can then be oxidized to the dye indigo-blue[310 ]. It is perhaps just as well for Central America that the cultivation of indigo has largely been abandoned, since preparation of the dye was injurious to the health of persons employed in the industry. The freshly cut plants were immersed in large vats lined with bricks, such as may sometimes be discovered even now about Central American fincas. After fermentation had proceeded for some time, the plants were trampled by men in the tanks, after which the dye settled to the bottom of the water and was formed into small cakes that were later dried[331 ]. Indigo was formerly much planted in some parts of Guatemala, especially in the Oriente and along the Pacific foothills and plains, and some is grown even today, for dyeing native textiles. The indigo-coloured coats and trousers forming the costumes of the men of certain highland towns are most distinctive. As late as 1883 it was reported that 135 quintales (hundredweight) of indigo were exported from Guatemala."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Industrial Crop: Dye: Botanical dyes replacing synthetic dyes (known as heavy polluters).,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Industrial Crop: Dye  Management: Coppice  Minor Global CropSucceeds in tropical and subtropical climates. Plants are not frost resistant[375 ]. Well adapted to fertile silty-sandy soils[375 ]. Succeeds in soils with low fertility[375 ]. Grows well in soils with a low pH[375 ]. Established plants are drought resistant[375 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring Mid Spring Mid Winter. Bloom Color: Purple. Spacing: 6-8 ft. (1.8-2.4 m)."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sowing is done either in seed-beds or directly into the field[310 ]. Seed Collecting: Allow pods to dry on plant; break open to collect seeds. Pre-soak the seed in warm water overnight for optimal germination[310 ]. Germination takes 4 - 6 days[310 ]. Seedlings quickly develop a deep root system and so, when a seed-bed is used the seedlings should be transplanted into their permanent positions within 4 - 6 weeks after sowing[310 ]. Stem cuttings are taken from well developed branches divided into 30 cm long pieces[310 ]. They are kept for 2 - 3 days in a cool place before planting out, 2 - 3 per hole. Rooting starts in the second week[310 ]."
