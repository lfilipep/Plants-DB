It requires a well-drained soil and should succeed in sun or shade. A fully parasitic plant lacking in chlorophyll, it is entirely dependant upon its host plant for obtaining nutrient[200]. Its natural hosts are coniferous trees[60]. Modern research shows that the plant is not parasitic on coniferous plants but uses Holodiscus discolor as its host (personal communication from M. Ellis )",Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in a pot containing a host plant. The seed is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. It might also be possible to sow the seed in situ around a host plant.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
