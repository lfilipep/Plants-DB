It reaches up to 4 m in height. It has thin papery bark, thorny branches, simple or trifoliate leaves, red to pink flowers, and small round fruits. The plant's bark yields gummy resin that is commonly used in perfumery and in incense. C. wightii is used in Ayurvedic medicine. In fact, its extensive use in India has resulted to scarcity in Gujarat and Rajastan and it has been enlisted as endangered species. The gum extract is believed to decrease cholesterol synthesis in the liver. It is used to treat muscular rheumatism. Young branches are used as a toothbrush.","Commiphora wightii is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Commiphora roxburghii (Stocks) Engl.,,,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.",pungent gum is obtained from the bark[ 301 ].,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow.

It is used in the treatment of muscular rheumatism[ 46 ]. The gum resin has been used extensively by Ayurvedic physicians for centuries to treat a wide variety of disorders[ 303 ]. It is a natural health product, used primarily to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels[ 303 ]. It has been used for many years as a hypocholesterolemic agent in India, where it is has received prescription drug status, due to its high level of efficacy as determined by clinical trials[ 303 ].","Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.","Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes grown as a barrier hedge[ 303 ]. Other Uses The tree is the source of Guggul or Indian Bdellium, a gum-resin that exudes from the branches. It is largely used as an incense and in perfumery[ 287 ]. The thick branches are selected in winter and their bark incised to extract the oleo resin gum[ 299 ]. The commercial product of the oleo-gum resin contains 58% resin along with mineral matter, 32.3% gum, 4.65% foreign organic matter and 1.45% aromatic essential oil[ 303 ]. Young branches are used as a toothbrush to clean the teeth and maintain dental hygiene[ 303 ].",,"A plant of arid and semi-arid areas in the tropics where it can be found at elevations from 250 - 1,800 metres. It is found in areas where the mean annual rainfall is within the range 225 - 500mm and the temperature ranges from 20 - 35c[ 303 ]. Requires a sunny position[ 303 ]. Found in the wild in sandy and rocky soils[ 303 ]. A slow growing plant, it takes 8 to 10 years to reach a height of 3 - 3.5 metres. Pruning or the removal of branches in the early stages of the plant's growth helps to achieve better growth, increases the girth of growing branches and thereby leads to better gum yield[ 303 ]. The plant generally takes ten years to reach tapping maturity under the dry climatic conditions of its native environment[ 303 ]. The yields are in the order of 200 - 500 gm of dry guggul per tree per season[ 303 ]. Plants are dimorphic, one form having bisexual and male flowers, whilst the other has female flowers with staminodes[ 287 ]. It is inferred that pollen grains from bisexual or male flowers, present on the first form of plants are needed for the production of normal fruits on plants with only female flowers[ 287 ]. It has become so scarce in its two habitats in India - Gujarat and Rajasthan - that the World Conservation Union (IUCN) has enlisted it in its Red Data List of endangered species.",From seed; stratify if sowing indoors.
