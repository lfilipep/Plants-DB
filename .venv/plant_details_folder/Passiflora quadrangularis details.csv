24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in the hot, wet, lowlands to moderate elevations in tropical to subtropical climates[262 , 335 ]. Plants require a temperature no lower than around 16°c when they are flowering in order to ensure fruit set[200 ]. They can be damaged if temperatures fall much below 10°c[262 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade where it can grow up towards the sun[262 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Seedling plants can commence fruiting when only 1 - 2 years old, whilst cuttings have been known to fruit in their first year of growth[335 ]. Plants can flower and fruit all year round[262 ]. A self-sterile species[200 ]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. Flowering Time: Blooms repeatedly. Bloom Color: Red Violet/Lavender White/Near White. Spacing: 24-36 in. (60-90 cm).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262 ]. Cuttings of fully mature wood taken at a node. They can take 3 months, but there is usually a high percentage[3 ]. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering.",
