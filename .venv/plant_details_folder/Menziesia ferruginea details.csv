Prefers moderate shade, especially on the roots[1, 200], but it can also succeed in full sun[11]. Grows well in a woodland garden[200]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[200]. The young growth in spring is susceptible to damage by late frosts but the plants are otherwise of easy cultivation[182]. Flowers are produced on the previous years wood[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in a shady position in a cold frame in the autumn[200] but it can also be sown in late winter [78]. Surface sow and do not allow the compost to become dry. Germination is variable and can take 1 - 2 months at 15°c[78]. Keep the seedlings heavily shaded and prick them out into individual pots when they are 12 months old[78]. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer once they are more than 15cm tall. Cuttings of semi-ripe wood, 2 - 5cm with a heel, May/June in a frame. Keep them shaded. The cuttings are very slow to root but usually a good percentage will succeed[78]. Division in early spring just before active growth begins[78].
