Because of its toxicity, it is a remedy that is seldom used in modern herbalism[238], but the leaves have been used externally in herbal medicine and are a good remedy for many skin diseases and inflammation[4]. The leaves are analgesic, astringent, disinfectant, narcotic, salve and sedative[257]. An infusion of the leaves is used as a disinfectant wash and liniment to treat pain, scratches, rheumatism, inflammations and to get rid of body parasites[257]. Used internally, the leaves have a splendid effect in the treatment of active haemorrhages, diarrhoea and flux[4, 21, 61]. They are also used in the treatment of syphilis, inflammatory fevers, neuralgia, paralytic conditions, tinnitus and angina[238]. The leaves should be used with great caution however, and only under the guidance of a qualified practitioner[238]. Excess doses cause vertigo, headache, loss of sight, salivation, thirst, nausea, palpitations, slow pulse and difficulty in breathing[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Antifungal [303].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Rock garden, Specimen. Requires an acid humus-rich soil, succeeding in part shade[182] or in full sun in cooler areas. Prefers almost full sun[11]. Dislikes dry soils[182], requiring cool, permanently moist conditions at the roots[21]. Succeeds in open woodland or along the woodland edge[200]. Plants are very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[11], there are many named varieties[182]. This species is not very easy to grow well in Britain, it probably prefers a more continental climate[11]. This species is the state flower of Connecticut[238]. Slow to rejuvenate if the plant is cut back[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Blooms are very showy.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in late winter in a cool greenhouse in light shade[78, 113]. Prick out the young seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. The seedlings are rather sensitive to damping off, so water them with care, keep them well-ventilated and perhaps apply a fungicide such as garlic as a preventative. Grow the young plants on in light shade and overwinter them in the greenhouse for their first winter[78]. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. The seed is dust-like and remains viable for many years[113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, August in a frame. Very poor results unless the cuttings are taken from very young plants[11, 78]. Layering in August/September. Takes 18 months[78]. The plants can also be dug up and replanted about 30cm deeper in the soil to cover up some of the branches. The plant can then be dug up about 12 months later when the branches will have formed roots and can be separated to make new plants[200].",
