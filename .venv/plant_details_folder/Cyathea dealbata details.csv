0,Cyathea dealbata,Tree Fern,Cyatheaceae,8-11,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].","Lowland to montane forests and shrubland on North, South and Chatham Islands[44].",New Zealand.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Half Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CyatheaDealbata.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CyatheaDealbata2.gif",,"Cyathea dealbata is an evergreen Fern growing to 9 m (29ft) by 2 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Bog Garden;,"Leaves: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Pith of the stem[2, 46, 61, 105]. Rich in starch, it is normally roasted but can be eaten raw[193]. Descriptions of the taste vary from bitter, sweet, astringent and like a bad turnip[193]. The core of the plant near the growing tip is used[193], do not confuse this with the trunk of the plant, which is made up of a peaty substance from the decaying roots[K]. Harvesting the stem kills the plant so this use cannot normally be condoned[193]. Young leaves - cooked. Harvested just before they unfurl, they are juicy and slimy, tasting like bitter celery[193].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It grows well in light woodland. Requires shelter from winds, an abundance of moisture at its roots and its trunk kept wet[1, 49, 200]. A very ornamental plant, it succeeds outdoors in woodland conditions in the mildest areas of the country, but it is tender in most parts of Britain[49]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",Spores - can be surface sown at any time of the year in a light position in a warm greenhouse[164]. Keep moist by standing the pot in shallow water or by enclosing it in a plastic bag. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 25°c. Prick out patches of the young plants into small pots and stand the pots in shallow water until the plants are well established[164]. Grow on in a shady position in a greenhouse for at least the first two winters and plant out in late spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
