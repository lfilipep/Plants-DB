24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds a sheltered position in full sun in any fertile well-drained soil[166, 182, 188]. Plants usually require protection outside the mildest areas of Britain[11], they are hardy to about -5°c, though the sub-species O. schwerinii microphylla. Rehder.&Wils. is hardier, to about -10°c[184]. This sub-species is often mistakenly sold under the name O. subrotunda[219]. They can be grown on a sunny wall[11]. Seed is seldom set in Britain[219]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification and can be sown in late autumn in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn and overwinter in a greenhouse. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering."
