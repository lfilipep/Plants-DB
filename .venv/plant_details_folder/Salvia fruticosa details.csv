The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"eaThe leaves are used as a spice or as an adulterant of sage (S. officinalis)[183]. Somewhat inferior in quality to sage but it is easier to grow indoors[183]. The leaves make up 50 - 95% of commercially dried sage leaves[238]. A fragrant tea, called 'fascomiglia' is made by infusing the leaves[148, 200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antihydrotic: Reduces perspiration.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antihydrotic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Carminative  Cholagogue  Depurative  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Stimulant  Tonic  VasodilatorThe leaves are antihydrotic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, carminative, cholagogue, depurative, expectorant, febrifuge, stimulant, tonic and vasodilator[4, 9, 13, 21, 165, 238]. They are used internally in the treatment of digestive and respiratory complaints, menstrual problems, infertility, nervous tension and depression[238]. This remedy should not be prescribed to pregnant women[238]. The leaves can be harvested as required and used fresh, or they can be harvested before the flowers open and dried or distilled for their essential oil[238]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
23,Other Uses Description,An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used to adulterate spike lavender oil (obtained from Lavandula latifolia)[238].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very well-drained light sandy soil in a sunny position[200]. Prefers a rich soil[1]. Soils rich in nitrogen encourage excessive leaf growth at the expense of flowering[11]. Plants are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, though they should succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, but perhaps even there needing the protection of a south-facing wall. Plants can be killed by excessive winter wet[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees, providing a good source of nectar[148]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200]."
