24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on the needs of this plant, and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. Judging by its native range, however, it is likely to succeed in most areas of this country. Growing in a variety of habitats in the wild, though usually in dry soils, it is likely to be quite adaptable here so long as the ground is well-drained[K]. This is a very variable plant in the wild, it is erect and rather stout when growing in dry open ground, but weak with a lax panicle when growing in the shade[236]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow outdoors in a seedbed in spring and only just cover the seed[133]. It usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks so long as the soil does not dry out.
