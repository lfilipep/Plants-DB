14,Physical Characteristics,"Dioscorea alata is an evergreen Perennial Climber growing to 15 m (49ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind, Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc."
18,Edible Uses,Colouring: edible dyes
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - cooked[ 300 ]. Usually boiled or baked and used as a vegetable[ 300 , 301 ]. An average of 3 roots are produced by the plants, these usually each weigh in the range of 5 - 10kg, though exceptionally they can weigh up to 60 kg[ 300 ]. The root needs to be properly cooked, it can be toxic if eaten raw[ 332 ]. The plant produces aerial tubers and these can be eaten in the same way as the tubers[ 301 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The tuber is grated, mixed with brown stout vinegar, then spread onto paper and placed on the small of a woman's back to prevent or forestall a threatened miscarriage[ 348 ]. Although available as a dietary supplement and used in folk medicine, there is no clinical evidence that D. alata has any therapeutic properties. D. alata supplements may have adverse effects in people taking estrogens, anticoagulant drugs or during pregnancy and breast-feeding. D. alata has relatively high levels of oxalates (486–781 mg/100 g dry matter)."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves."
23,Other Uses Description,/animal feed. Agroforestry. Ornamental. Medicinal:Traditional/folklore. Purple variety colour is due to various water-soluble anthocyanin pigments and is used as a food colouring agent.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Plants grow best in lowland tropical areas up to an elevation of 1,000 metres with a temperature around 26 - 34°c; a well-defined dry season of 4 - 5 months; and a total rainfall of 1,000 - 1,500mm evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the year[ 300 ]. Plants are not frost tolerant[ 418 ]. Amongst the many cultivars of this species, there are forms that are tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions[ 300 ]. For best yields, this species requires a deep, well-drained, sandy loam that is not liable to water-logging[ 300 ]. It also grows well in medium to clay loams[ 300 ]. Although more tolerant of poor soils than most other members of this genus, plants respond well to the application of organic matter[ 300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.8 - 8.5[ 418 ]. Daylengths of more than 12 hours are preferred during the early growing season since this encourages vegetative growth; daylengths of less than 12 hours towards the end of the growing season will encourage tuber formation and development[ 300 ]. Plants take 7 - 10 months to mature a crop[ 300 ]. Yields of 20 - 25 tonnes per hectare have been obtained[ 300 ]. There are some named varieties[ 300 , 301 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female plants need to be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - rarely produced in cultivation, they are not normally used to propagate this species. Cuttings of tubers. Small tubers can be cut into 2 - 4 sections, larger ones into 6 - 8 sections. Each section should have 2 - 3 dormant buds. The cut tuber is often left in the sun for several hours to promote wound healing and reduce the risk of fungal infection[ 300 ]. Aerial tubers can also be used, they usually produce vigorous plants[ 300 ]."
