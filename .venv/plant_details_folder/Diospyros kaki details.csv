13,Summary,"Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Diospyros kaki is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 7 m (23ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen in November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: ,
18,Edible Uses,"Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"enerFruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 3, 7, 46, 61]. The fruit has an exquisitely rich flavour when it is very soft and fully ripe (almost at the point of going bad), but the fruit of many cultivars is very harsh and astringent before then[K]. In Britain, the fruit needs to be harvested whilst it is still very hard. This is done very late in the season (in December or even January if possible), it is then stored in a cool but frost-free place until very soft and fully ripe[K]. The fruit can also be used in pies, cakes, bread, desserts etc[183]. It contains 25% sugars[74]. A fuller nutritional analysis is available[218]. The fruit can also be dried for later use[183]. The fruit is about 7.5cm in diameter[200]. The peel of the fruit can be powdered and used as a sweetener[183]. The leaves are used to improve the flavour of pickled radishes[183]. The roasted seeds are a coffee substitute[183, 240].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antitussive  Antivinous  Appetizer  Astringent  Demulcent  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Hypotensive  Laxative  Sialagogue  Stomachic  StypticAppetizer, sialagogue[116, 176, 178]. The stem bark is astringent and styptic[218]. The fruit is said to have different properties depending on its stage of ripeness, though it is generally antitussive, astringent, laxative, nutritive and stomachic[218, 238]. The fresh fully ripe fruit is used raw in the treatment of constipation and haemorrhoids[238] and when cooked is used to treat diarrhoea[238].. The dried ripe fruit is used in the treatment of bronchial complaints[238], whilst when ground into a powder it is used to treat dry coughs[238]. Juice from the unripe fruit is used in the treatment of hypertension[218, 238]. The fruits, picked green and ripened in containers with the leaves, become very sweet and are considered to be antifebrile, antivinous and demulcent[218]. The fruits are also peeled and then exposed to sunlight by day and dew by night. They become encrusted with a white powder and are then considered to be anthelmintic, antihaemorrhagic, antivinous, expectorant, febrifuge and restorative[218]. The peduncle is used to treat coughs and hiccups[218]. The calyx is used to treat hiccups[176].",
22,Other Uses,"Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,The pulp of unripe fruits is used in cosmetics to make face-packs because of its firming qualities[7].  - hard and durable with a beautiful grain. Used for making fine furniture[266].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses: Pest tolerant. Prefers a good deep loamy soil in sun or light shade but succeeds in most soils[11, 132, 200]. Dislikes very acid or wet and poorly drained soils[200]. Requires a sheltered position[200]. Dormant plants are quite hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -14°c[74], but they require warmer summers than are normally experienced in Britain in order to ripen their fruit and wood[3]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A warm sunny wall improves the chance of producing ripe fruit[3] and trees fruit freely when grown under glass[1]. Fruits are frequently produced outdoors at Kew[11, K]. A tree seen in a open position with afternoon shade at Kew in November 1993 (after a cool summer) had about 200 almost ripe fruits around 8cm in diameter[K]. The same tree, after a fairly warm summer in 1996, had a large quantity of fruit just about ready for harvesting in the middle of December[K]. Trees produce a long taproot and should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. The young trees require some winter protection for their first winter or two[K]. The persimmon is widely cultivated for its edible fruit in warm temperate areas of the world, especially in Japan and China, there are many named varieties[183]. Some cultivars, such as 'Fuyu', lack the usual astringency and can be eaten whilst still firm, though they develop a richer flavour if allowed to become soft[183, 200]. These non-astringent forms require a warmer climate and do not ripen in cooler areas[183]. The astringent cultivars are somewhat hardier and ripen well in cooler climates than the non-astringent forms[183]. The fruit colours better and is sweeter in warmer areas but in hot conditions has a poor texture and deep black spots develop[183]. If allowed to become very ripe (almost to the point of going rotten), they develop a better flavour than non-astringent forms[183]. Dioecious, but the female tree can produce seedless fruits in the absence of a pollinator. However, unfertilized fruit tends to be smaller and more astringent[200]. This astringency is due to the high content of tannin but once the fruit is fully ripe it loses this astringency and becomes sweet[132]. If fertilized fruit is required, then growing one male for every 8 - 10 females is usually adequate[238]. Special Features:Edible, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 10 through 7. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[113, 200]. Stored seed requires a period of cold-stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible[78]. It usually germinates in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[175]. Pot up the young seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into fairly deep pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Give them some protection from winter cold for their first year or two outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Layering in spring[200].",
