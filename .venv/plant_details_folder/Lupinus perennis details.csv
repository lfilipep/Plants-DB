1,Common Name,Sundial Lupine,
2,Family,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,
3,USDA hardiness,4-8,
4,Known Hazards,"The seed of many lupin species contain bitter-tasting toxic alkaloids, though there are often sweet varieties within that species that are completely wholesome[65, 76]. Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65].",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Lupinus perennis is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[105]. Used as a protein-rich vegetable or savoury dish in any of the ways that cooked beans are used, they can also be roasted or ground into a powder. The seed has a bitter flavour due to the presence of toxic alkaloids, it should be thoroughly leached before being cooked[2, 105]. Seedpods - cooked[105].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  HaemostaticA cold tea made from the leaves has been used to treat nausea and internal haemorrhages[222, 257].",
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,Nitrogen fixer. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good soil in a sunny position[200]. Grows well in a poor sandy soil[187]. Requires an acid to neutral soil[200]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. This species is very susceptible to slug damage. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.) For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a greenhouse. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. It should also be possible to sow the seed outdoors in situ in the middle of spring. It might be necessary to protect this sowing from mice. Division in early March[1]. Difficult. Basal cuttings in April[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
