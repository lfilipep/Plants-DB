21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  Bitter  Febrifuge  Malaria  ParasiticideJamaican quassia bark contains several medically active constituents including quassinoid bitter principles (including quassin); alkaloids; a coumarin, scopoletin; and vitamin B1[254 ]. It is an intensely bitter, non-astringent, odourless herb that lowers fever, stimulates appetite and improves digestion[238 ]. It is an effective parasiticide and is reputedly antileukaemic[238 ]. Some of the quassinoids have been shown to have cytotoxic and antileukaemic actions[254 ]. The strongly bitter principle in the bark supports and strengthens weak digestive systems, increasing bile flow plus the secretion of salivary juices and stomach acids[254 ]. It is used internally in the treatment of a wide range of illnesses where digestion is a contributory factor, particularly convalescent debility, poor appetite and anorexia[238 , 254 ]. Its bitterness has led to it being used in the treatment of malaria and other fevers[238 , 254 ]. It is also used to rid the body of nematode worms[238 ]. Used externally, it is a good lotion to get rid of parasites such as lice[238 ]. It is also used in an enema to rid the body of threadworms and other parasites[238 , 254 ]. The bark can be harvested as required throughout the year, and can be dried for later use[254 ]."
