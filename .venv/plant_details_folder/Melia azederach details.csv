A sweetish flavour, it is eaten by children though some people believe it to be poisonous[2]. The fruit is between 1 and 5cm in diameter[200] and contains a single seed[219]. Both these reports, of edible leaves and fruits, should be treated with some caution. The fruit is poisonous according to one report where it says that the ripe fruit is more poisonous than the green fruit and that they have sometimes caused human fatalities[218]. A cooling drink is made from the sap[2] - it is actually a gum[64]. This gum is tasteless, clear to dark amber and of good solubility[64]. The sap is obtained from incisions that are made near the base of the trunk in the spring[2].",

An aqueous extract reduces the intensity of asthmatic attacks[240]. (This report does not specify the part of the plant that is used[K].) The leaf juice is anthelmintic, antilithic, diuretic and emmenagogue[218, 240]. A decoction is astringent and stomachic[218]. The leaves are harvested during the growing season and can be used fresh or dried[238]. The flowers and leaves are applied as a poultice in the treatment of neuralgia and nervous headache[218, 240].

The fruit is antiseptic and febrifuge[218]. The pulp is used as a vermifuge[227]. The fruit is harvested in the autumn when it is fully ripe and can be used fresh or dried[238]. The seed is antirheumatic[218, 240]. It is used externally. The root bark is emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and vermifuge[21, 176, 218]. It is highly effective against ringworm and other parasitic skin diseases[218]. It can be harvested at any time of the year and is used fresh or dried[238]. A gum that exudes from the tree is considered by some to have aphrodisiac properties[21]. This plant should be used with caution, preferably under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238].

It is used for making furniture, packing cases etc[114, 146, 149, 227]. Because it is fast-growing, it is often used as a fuel[272].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Industrial Crop: Pesticide: Many plants provide natural pesticides.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Oil  Industrial Crop: Pesticide  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropRequires a sunny sheltered position[166]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils and in hot dry conditions[200]. Likes sandy soils[188]. Grows well in mild coastal areas[188]. A very ornamental tree[1], it is not very cold tolerant being killed by temperatures lower than about -5°c[260]. It only succeeds outdoors in the mildest areas of Britain[166], seldom growing larger than a shrub[182]. It is hardy on a sunny wall in S.W. England[11, 219]. It is often cultivated in warmer regions than Britain for its many useful qualities[1]. The flowers are produced on the current years wood and have a delicate sweet perfume[182, 245]. The trees do not normally require pruning[219]. The seeds have a strong scent of musk and the wood is also musk-scented[245]. Trees are very susceptible to forest fire, though they sprout back readily from the roots[229]. They are planted for re-afforestation in their native areas, where they are fast growing though short-lived[200, 229]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[188, 238]. The seed usually germinates well. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Root cuttings[113].",
