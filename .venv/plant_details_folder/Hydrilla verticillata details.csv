22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A submerged water plant, it prefers growing in alkaline water[200]. A good oxygenator for ponds, the plant forms a large mass with stems up to 2 metres long[1, 200]. This is a very vigorous species which can regrow from even small sections of the plant. Stem fragments become rooted by fine, unbranched adventitious roots and soon produce vegetative reproductive structures from both subterranean and erect stems[270]. Tubers produced on subterranean stems are pale brown; those produced on erect stems are dark olive-green and covered with short, stiff scales. Both types germinate quickly to produce new stems[270]. This species has often invaded native habitats, clogging waterways and crowding out native species of flora and fauna[274]. It is considered a noxious weed in many areas[274]. Plants can be monoecious or dioecious. Dioecious plants (usually female) are triploid forms whilst monoecious plants are diploid[274]. Male flowers are released from the plant under water. They float to the surface where they release their pollen to fertilize female flowers[274].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it is quite likely that seed must be kept moist in order to maintain viability. If seed can be obtained, it is probably best sown immediately in a greenhouse in soil covered with water. Tubers - plant immediately in soil covered in water, Division - even small sections of stem will soon start producing roots when placed in water.",
