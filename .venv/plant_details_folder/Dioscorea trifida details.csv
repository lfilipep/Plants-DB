14,Physical Characteristics,"Dioscorea trifida is an evergreen Perennial Climber growing to 3 m (9ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind, Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - cooked[ 300 ]. Boiled or baked, some forms have an excellent flavour[ 300 ]. The cooked flesh is smooth in texture, attractive and of an unusually rich flavour that is readily appreciated and sufficiently moist in the mouth[ 301 ]. Roots are about 15 - 20cm long and 6 - 8cm in diameter[ 300 ]. The tuber is about 38% waxy starch that lacks amylose and has potential uses as a binder and thickener in food processing."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist tropics and subtropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 26°c, but can tolerate 10 - 36°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 7°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 2,600mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 4,000mm[ 418 ]. This species grows better at lower temperatures than most tropical yams[ 300 ]. Prefers a sunny position, tolerating some shade[ 418 ]. For best yields, most yams require a deep, well-drained, sandy loam that is not liable to water-logging[ 300 ]. This species will succeed in a wide range of soils so long as there is plenty of organic matter and they are well drained[ 300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 6.7, tolerating 5.3 - 8[ 418 ]. Daylengths of more than 12 hours are preferred during the early growing season since this encourages vegetative growth; daylengths of less than 12 hours towards the end of the growing season will encourage tuber formation and development[ 300 ]. Crops can be obtained in 9 - 11 months from planting, yields of 15 - 20 tonnes per hectare have been achieved[ 300 ]. Plants produce groups of 5 - 50 tubers from enlarged stolons or runners[ 300 ]. This is perhaps the only cultivated yam species that has retained its full reproductive potential through seed formation[ 300 ]. There are some named varieties[ 46 , 300 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female plants need to be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sown in containers and planted out at the beginning of the growing season[ 300 ]. Cuttings of tubers. Small tubers can be cut into 2 - 4 sections, larger ones into 6 - 8 sections. Each section should have 2 - 3 dormant buds. The cut tuber is often left in the sun for several hours to promote wound healing and reduce the risk of fungal infection[ 300 ]."
