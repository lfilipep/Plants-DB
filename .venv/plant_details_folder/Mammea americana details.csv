24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Mammee apple is limited to tropical or near tropical moist to wet climates[303 ]. It grows best in the lowlands, but can succeed at elevations up to 1,000 metres[303 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 12 - 35°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,800mm, but tolerates 800 - 2,600mm[418 ]. Prefers a position in full sun or light shade[307 ]. Prefers a deep, rich, well-drained sandy loam[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 6.5, tolerating 5.5 - 8[418 ]. Trees can produce their first crop in 6 - 10 years from seed[200 ]. Good trees can produce 300 - 400 fruits per year[418 ]. There are some named varieties[301 ]. One report says that the plant is dioecious[335 ], others that it is monoecious. In some forms of this plant, the flowers produced are predominantly female and the tree fruits heavily, in other forms there can be a predominance of male flowers and fruit yields are much lower[200 ]. Flowering Time: Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: 20-30 ft. (6-9 m)."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seeds are the usual means of propagation and they germinate in 1 - 4 months with a 97% rate. Seeds sprout readily in leaf-mulch under the tree. Grown under light shade, seedlings reach 40 - 50cm and are ready to out-plant 3 - 5 months after sowing.[303 ]. Greenwood cuttings with bottom heat."
