Often self-sows, sometimes to the point of nuisance, though the seedlings can easily be hoed out and can also be transplanted if they are moved whilst still small[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ[200]. The seed can also be sown in situ in autumn[200]. If the seed is in short supply then it can be sown in a pot in the greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer.
