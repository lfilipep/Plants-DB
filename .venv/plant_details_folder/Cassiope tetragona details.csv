See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Andromeda tetragona.,Cultivated Beds;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.","The plant, combined with mosses and lichens, has been used as an insulation material in houses[257] The plant makes a good tinder[257]. Used for fuel[61, 257]. Considering the size of the plant (up to 30cm), this use must be born out of desperation in areas with very few woody plants[K].",,"Requires a lime-free well-drained but moistish soil and protection from bright sunlight[1, 11, 188]. Another report says that the plant tolerates some lime[200] whilst yet another report says that it is calcicole (requires a lime-rich soil)[50]. Plants seldom live long in the drier and warmer areas of the country, growing better in the west and north[182]. They prefer a colder winter than is normally experienced in S, Britain, with a covering of snow for protection and are hardy to at least -15°c[11, 200].","Seed - we have no details for this species but we would suggest surface-sowing sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe or in late winter in a well-drained ericaceous compost in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in August[78]. Alternatively, dig up the plant in early spring and replant it 10 - 20cm deeper in the soil. The buried branches will form roots and these can be divided and replanted in the autumn of the following year[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots, 2 -3cm with a heel, in a shady frame in August. Do not remove the leaves or allow the cuttings to dry out. Fair percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
