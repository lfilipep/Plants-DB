18,Medicinal Uses,,
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The plant, combined with mosses and lichens, has been used as an insulation material in houses[257] The plant makes a good tinder[257]. Used for fuel[61, 257]. Considering the size of the plant (up to 30cm), this use must be born out of desperation in areas with very few woody plants[K].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free well-drained but moistish soil and protection from bright sunlight[1, 11, 188]. Another report says that the plant tolerates some lime[200] whilst yet another report says that it is calcicole (requires a lime-rich soil)[50]. Plants seldom live long in the drier and warmer areas of the country, growing better in the west and north[182]. They prefer a colder winter than is normally experienced in S, Britain, with a covering of snow for protection and are hardy to at least -15°c[11, 200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but we would suggest surface-sowing sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe or in late winter in a well-drained ericaceous compost in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in August[78]. Alternatively, dig up the plant in early spring and replant it 10 - 20cm deeper in the soil. The buried branches will form roots and these can be divided and replanted in the autumn of the following year[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots, 2 -3cm with a heel, in a shady frame in August. Do not remove the leaves or allow the cuttings to dry out. Fair percentage[78].",
