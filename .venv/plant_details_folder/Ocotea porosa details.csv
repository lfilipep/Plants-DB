Other Uses The heartwood can be of varied colours, mainly ranging from yellow-brown to a dark brown with irregular, thin, darker layers; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 6cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked; the surface is irregularly lustrous and smooth; there is a pleasant scent. The wood is moderately heavy, moderately hard; fairly durable, even when exposed to the elements, being resistant to dry wood borers and moderately resistant to fungi and termites. It seasons slowly, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is stable in service. It works well with ordinary tools, nailing and screwing are good; gluing is correct. A beautiful wood that is highly valued for the manufacture of luxury furniture, it is also used to make parquet blocks, luxury joinery, carpentry, turnery, panelling, stairs, and for external purposes such as sleepers, bridges and stakes[419 , 848 ]."
