Requires a well-drained soil, preferably in full sun though it tolerates light shade[200]. Prefers a slightly alkaline soil[200].

A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are very attractive to bees[200]. Plants are prone to slug and snail damage[188]. Often self-sows, sometimes to the point of nuisance, though the seedlings can easily be hoed out and can also be transplanted if they are moved whilst still small[200].",Seed - sow spring in situ[200]. The seed can also be sown in situ in autumn[200]. If the seed is in short supply then it can be sown in a pot in the greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
