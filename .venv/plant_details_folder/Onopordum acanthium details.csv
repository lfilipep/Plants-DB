Requires a well-drained soil, preferably in full sun though it tolerates light shade[200]. Prefers a slightly alkaline soil[200]. Grows very well in poor soils, succeeding in hot dry situations and tolerating drought when it is established[190]. A slow-growing plant[188]. Hardy to about -15°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are very attractive to bees[200]. Plants are prone to slug and snail damage[188]. Often self-sows, sometimes to the point of nuisance, though the seedlings can easily be hoed out and can also be transplanted if they are moved whilst still small[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ[200]. The seed can also be sown in situ in autumn[200]. If the seed is in short supply then it can be sown in a pot in the greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer.
