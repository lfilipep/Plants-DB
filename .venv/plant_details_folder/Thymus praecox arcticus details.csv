See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",T. arcticus. T. brittanicus. T. carniolicus.

Retains its flavour well in long slow cooking. If the leaves are to be dried, the plants should be harvested in early and late summer just before the flowers open and the leaves should be dried quickly[200]. An aromatic tea is made from the leaves or dried flowers[183].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Deodorant: Masks smells.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Carminative  Deodorant  Diaphoretic  Disinfectant  Expectorant  Sedative  TonicThe leaves, and especially the essential oil contained in them, are anthelmintic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, deodorant, diaphoretic, disinfectant, expectorant, sedative and tonic[4, 7, 21, 200, 238]. The plant can be used fresh at any time of the year, or it can be harvested as it comes into flower and either be distilled for the oil or dried for later use[238].","Deodorant: A pleasant smelling plant that is used on the body to mask the human smell.,Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fungicide: Arrests the growth of, or kills, fungi.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","An essential oil from the leaves is used in perfumery, soaps, medicinally etc[200]. It has fungicidal properties[171]. The dried flowers are used to repel moths from clothing[4].",,"Requires a light well-drained preferably calcareous soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils, tolerating drought once it is established[190]. Grows well between stepping stones on paths, tolerating light treading[183, 200]. Succeeds on walls. Thymes dislike wet conditions, especially in the winter. A layer of gravel on the soil around them will help protect the foliage from wet soils[238]. Hardy to about -15°c[200]. Closely related to T. serpyllum[11], this plant is the true native wild thyme in Britain[11]. It is a very polymorphic plant, there are a number of named forms[183]. This is a very difficult genus taxonomically, the species hybridize freely with each other and often intergrade into each other[1]. A good companion for most other plants[54], it makes a very good carpeting plant for the rockery or between paving stones[1]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are very attractive to honey bees[200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed can also be sown in autumn in a greenhouse. Surface sow or barely cover the seed. Germination can be erratic. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
