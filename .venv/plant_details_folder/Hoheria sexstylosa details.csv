It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.
19,Edible Uses Description,". A famine food, it is only used in times of scarcity[173]. No more details are given but inner bark is often dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickening in soups etc or mixed with cereals when making bread."

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"The uses listed below have been given for the closely related H. populnea. They can quite possibly also be applied to this species. A very strong fibre is obtained from the inner bark[128]. It is used for ropes, cord etc[46, 61]. The fibre is also used as ornamentation in basket making and for bonnets etc[128]. Wood - white, very tough. Used by cabinet makers, it also makes an excellent fuel[128]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows in any good, well-drained soil[1]. Requires a position in full sun[184] or dappled shade[200], succeeding in acid or alkaline soils[182]. Plants grown in a soil that is overly rich produce a lot of sappy growth that is more susceptible to frost damage[200]. Withstands strong winds but is best if given protection from cold north-easterly winds[200]. Another report says that it requires a position sheltered from strong winds[125]. Prefers a moist atmosphere[125]. Prefers a maritime climate[200]. Plants grow best in an open clearing in a woodland garden[200]. A very ornamental[1] and fast growing[11] tree, it is only hardy in the milder areas of the country[1, 11, 49], tolerating temperatures down to about -15°c[184]. Plants are prone to damage at temperatures lower than -5°c[200] and are defoliated in cold winters[219]. A very variable plant[11], leaves of young plants are often deeply lobed but on older plants they are more or less entire and toothed[126, 182]. Juvenile plants also have a compact shrubby habit, quite unlike the mature plant[200]. Often self-sows[200]. Plants are subject to attacks by the coral-spot fungus, especially after cool wet summers[126]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. A good butterfly plant[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow autumn in a greenhouse. It usually germinates freely[220]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a shady position in a frame. The cuttings should be put in 12cm pots. A fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in April. Takes 12 months[78]."
