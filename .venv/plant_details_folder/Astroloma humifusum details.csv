This species is hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. Plants can survive frosts in Britain, particularly if the roots are well mulched, but they are best when grown in a cold greenhouse in this country[200]. The plants have a very fine root system which makes transplanting difficult[157].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. The seed has a hard coat and some form of scarification is necessary or the seed can take up to 5 years to germinate. Two or three periods each of 4 - 6 weeks cold stratification can reduce the time taken to germinate[175]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. When large enough, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of firm young tip growths[200]. It is very difficult to obtain suitable wood[157] and the cuttings are slow to root[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
