13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rubus tricolor is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 2 m (6ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 11, 105]. The best forms can fruit quite well and have a good size and flavour[182, K]. Another report says that they are bland[202]. The bright red fruits are up to 17mm in diameter[266]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,"A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. A good vigorous ground cover plant for sun or shade[11, 200, 208]. It grows strongly but requires weeding for the first year or so[197]. New roots are formed at intervals along the stem[202]. It should only be grown with trees and other tall plants otherwise it will swamp them[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Plants grow best in part or full shade[182] and also succeed in dry shade[190]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190]. Hardy to about -15°c[184]. Plants are evergreen but may be deciduous in severe winters[202]. A fast growing plant, the stems can grow by up to 2 metres per year[184, 190]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 7. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping mat former. Forming a dense prostrate carpet spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification, is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed as early as possible in the year in a cold frame and stratify for a month at 3°c if sowing later than February. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring."
