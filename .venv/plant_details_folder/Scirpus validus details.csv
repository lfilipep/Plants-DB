Rich in starch. The root contains a meagre amount of starch[193]. The sweet roots are eaten raw in mid summer[257]. The bruised young roots, when boiled in water, furnish a sweet syrup[183]. The rhizomes are 3 - 10mm in diameter[270]. Young shoots - cooked[55, 62, 85, 183]. The tender base of the stem is eaten raw in salads[183, 257]. The pollen is used in soups or mixed with flour and used in making bread[177, 183]. It is rich in protein. Seed[62, 85, 159, 183]. No further details are given but it is probably ground into a powder and used in making bread etc. The seed is small and rather fiddly to harvest and utilize.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Only just cover the seed with soil[200]. The seed usually germinates fairly quickly. Prick out the plants when large enough to handle and plant out in their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
