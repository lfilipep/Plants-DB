When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings, 6 - 8cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Very easy, they can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
