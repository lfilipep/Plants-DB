13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prosopis pallida is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,The seedpods can be added to soups and corn meal; or made into a sweet syrup and used to prepare various drinks[418 ]. Staple Crop: balanced Carb.,
20,Medicinal Uses,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DysenteryThe seedpods are used in the treatment of dysentery[414 ].,
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is suitable for reforestation of hot dry areas where the soil is highly saline[418 ]. The tree is grown as a cover for the soil and shifting sand dunes in order to prevent erosion[414 ]. Other Uses: The bark is a source of tannins[414 , 418 ]. A gum exuding from the trunk can be used in glue and vanish[414 , 418 ]. The heartwood is dark reddish-brown, the sapwood light yellow[414 ]. The wood is dense, strong, relatively easy to work, durable but susceptible to termite attack[414 ]. It is used for crossties, piling, rural carpentry, vehicle parts, furniture, fence posts etc[418 ]. The wood can be used for fuel and for making charcoal[418 ]. Industrial Crop: Biomass. : Pod.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Pod  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: SRC  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA plant of drier areas in the tropics and subtropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 300 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 28°c, but can tolerate 19 - 32°c[418 ]. Mature plants can be killed by temperatures of -2°c or lower, but new growth can be killed at -1°c [418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 500 - 1,000mm, but tolerates 250 - 1,250mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position. Succeeds in a range of well-drained soils, including saline soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6, tolerating 5 - 6.7[418 ]. Established plants have deep tap roots and are very drought tolerant[305 , 418 ]. The tree can form dense thickets. It is a prolific producer of seed, which can be dispersed by water, in mud adhering to animals, boots etc, and by being eaten and defecated[305 ]. It has escaped from cultivation in many areas and can become an invasive and troublesome weed[305 , 418 ]. Plants grow quite slowly when young, to around 1 metre annually[414 ]. Plants are very fast to mature, able to flower and fruit within two years of sowing the seed[418 ]. Trees can be coppiced[414 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing.
