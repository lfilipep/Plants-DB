22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Woodland garden. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil in sun or dappled shade[200]. Requires a well-drained neutral to acid soil[188]. Requires a sunny sheltered position when grown outdoors in Britain[175]. Although not very cold-tolerant, this species can survive in sheltered stable environments in dappled shade, such as a woodland, if temperatures do not drop far below zero for long periods[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 24 hours in luke-warm water and then sow in spring in gentle heat in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 25°c[175]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two years. When large enough, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division as the plants come into growth in the spring[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
