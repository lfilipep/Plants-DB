22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Young trees are fairly shade tolerant, but older trees prefer a sunny position[ 404 ]. Members of this genus generally prefer a fertile, loam soil[ 200 ]. A slow-growing tree[ 404 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[ 755 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",
