The species was experimentally cultivated in the USSR during the years 1929–1937 as a source of rubber. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1].","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.","Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: HayClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. A woody, broomlike perennial herb usually growing to 0.5m but can reach 1m high. It has a taproot which can be very deep and highly branched. Usually found in Sand dunes, gravel and loess (a type of silt which forms fertile topsoil - The soil has few clay particles to hold it together) areas; Grows at 300-800m in the wild. Needs a well drained dry to moist soil. This genus is closely related to the dandelions of genus Taraxacum. Plants of both genera undergo apomixis, producing fertile seeds via asexual reproduction.
