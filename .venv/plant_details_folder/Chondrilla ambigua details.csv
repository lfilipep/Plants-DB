20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Possibly a hydrocarbon latex crop. The species was experimentally cultivated in the USSR during the years 1929–1937 as a source of rubber. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: HayClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. A woody, broomlike perennial herb usually growing to 0.5m but can reach 1m high. It has a taproot which can be very deep and highly branched. Usually found in Sand dunes, gravel and loess (a type of silt which forms fertile topsoil - The soil has few clay particles to hold it together) areas; Grows at 300-800m in the wild. Needs a well drained dry to moist soil. This genus is closely related to the dandelions of genus Taraxacum. Plants of both genera undergo apomixis, producing fertile seeds via asexual reproduction. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: experimental. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
