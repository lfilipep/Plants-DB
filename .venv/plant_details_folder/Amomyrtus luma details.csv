24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any reasonably good soil[1] including dry ones. Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained loam in a sunny position[200]. Dislikes cold drying winds but withstands considerable maritime exposure[182]. This species is not very hardy in most of Britain but it succeeds outdoors in mild maritime areas[11, 166]. There are a number of plants at Trewithen Gardens in Cornwall, these were fruiting heavily in late summer 1994[K]. The flowers, which are sweetly scented[245], are susceptible to damage by late spring frosts[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow it in late winter in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn and overwinter in a cold frame. Plant out in late spring. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 7 - 12cm with a heel, November in a shaded and frost free frame. Plant out in late spring or early autumn. High percentage[78]. Layering."
