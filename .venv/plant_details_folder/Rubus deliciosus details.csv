24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[184]. A very ornamental plant[1, 11], it is hardy to about -20°c[184]. The flowers have a delicious perfume[245]. This species is very closely related to R. trilobus[200]. The plant has perennial stems and should not be pruned like normal raspberries[200]. Instead it is sufficient to prune out any dead stems. There are no prickles on the stems[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]."
