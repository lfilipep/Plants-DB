19,Edible Uses Description,"aves - raw or cooked[4, 34, 37]. Added to salads or used as a potherb[183]. Immature flowering stems - cooked in much the same way as broccoli[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed, it is used mainly for cooking purposes, but also for salads[4, 13, 34, 46, 183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. The sprouted seed is often used as the mustard part of mustard and cress. Eaten in salads[4, 34, 37, 183]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  EmollientThe root is emollient and diuretic[240]. The juice of the roots is used in the treatment of chronic coughs and bronchial catarrh[240, 269]. The seed, powdered, with salt is said to be a folk remedy for cancer[269]. Rape oil is used in massage and oil baths, it is believed to strengthen the skin and keep it cool and healthy. With camphor it is applied as a remedy for rheumatism and stiff joints[269].",

23,Other Uses Description,"The seed contains up to 45% of an edible semi-drying oil, it is used as a luminant, lubricant, in soap making etc[13, 21, 57, 142].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200]. Succeeds in any reasonable soil[52]. Prefers a heavy soil and cool moist conditions[16, 20]. Sunny days and cool nights are favourable for plant growth whilst dry weather at harvest time is essential[269]. Rape is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 30 to 280cm, an annual average temperature range of 5 to 27°C and a pH in the range of 4.2 to 8.2[269]. Very young plants are susceptible to cold damage, -4°C either killing or injuring seedlings, whereas -2°C has no affect when the plants are more than one month old[269]. Rape is widely cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, there are many named varieties. The oil is high in erucic acid and glucosinolates, both of which have anti-nutritional properties. Cultivars have been developed that have a low content of these items and are therefore suitable for food. Rape is 70% self-pollinating and 30% cross-pollinated. Even if wind and insects are absent, seed are still produced. Yield increases with honeybees[269]. The growth of this plant is inhibited by field mustard and hedge mustard growing nearby[18, 20]. This species is closely related to B. rapa[200].",
