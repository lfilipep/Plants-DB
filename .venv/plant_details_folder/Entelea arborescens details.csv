22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile loamy soil in a sunny position[200]. This species is not very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. It usually requires cool greenhouse treatment in Britain[1]. Plants can succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[166, 200]. They get frosted back to the ground most years when growing in pots in a polytunnel on our Cornish trial grounds, though they resprout freely from the base[K].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse at 20°c. Quick and easy germination[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first two winters in a greenhouse. Plant out in early summer after the last expected frosts and give the plants some winter protection for their first couple of years[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. The cuttings root quickly and easily[K].",
