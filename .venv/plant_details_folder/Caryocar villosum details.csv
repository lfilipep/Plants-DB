It is suitable for house and ship building, cabinet making, wheel arches and hubs, fence posts, railway sleepers etc[317 , 419 , 492 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).,Wild Staple Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,Experimental Crop  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Oil  Wild Staple CropA slow-growing tree[419 ].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - takes 6 - 12 months to germinate[63 ]. Alternatively, immerse the seeds in warm water for 48 hours, changing the water every 12 hours[419 ]. Sow the seed in individual containers in a sunny or lightly shaded position. Pre-soaked seed can sprout within 30 - 50 days with a moderate germination rate[419 ]. Grow young plants on in a sheltered position with some shelter from the sun[63 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 25 cm tall[324 ]. Good results can be obtained from grafting and marcottage[324 ].",
