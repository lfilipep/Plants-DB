22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Evergreen prostrate perennial (mostly) to erect shrub. Flowers, golden-yellow, cover the plants in late spring to early summer. Poor, dry, sandy, and stony soils. Full sun or part shade and well drained soil. Soil pH: Acid/Neutral/Alkaline. Foot Traffic: Light. Drought tolerant. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed: Easy. Cover seed and germinate at 55-65F/13-18C. Chipping and soaking may aid germination. Do not transplant. Cuttings taken in summer, or by simple layering. Tip cuttings about 3-6 cm may be taken in mid-summer and rooted in a mist chamber or shaded frame.",
