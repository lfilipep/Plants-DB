0,Allium ampeloprasum babingtonii,Babington's Leek,Alliaceae,Coming soon,"Although no individual reports regarding this species have been seen, there have been cases of poisoning caused by the consumption, in large quantities and by some mammals, of certain members of this genus. Dogs seem to be particularly susceptible[76].",Clefts of rocks and sandy places near the coast[17].,Britain in S.W. England and the Channel Islands.,(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumAmpeloprasumBabbingtonii.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumAmpeloprasumBabbingtonii2.jpg",,"Allium ampeloprasum babingtonii is a BULB growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",A. babingtonii.,,"Bulb - raw or cooked. The small bulbs can vary considerably in size from 2 - 6cm[200], they have a pleasant mild garlic flavour[K]. Leaves - raw or cooked. The young leaves are pleasant raw, older leaves quickly become fibrous and are best cooked. They have a nice leek flavour[K]. The plants come into new growth in early winter and the leaves are often available from January[K]. Flowers - raw. A pleasant mild garlic flavour, but with a rather dry texture[K]. This species produces mainly bulbils and very few flowers[K]. The bulbils have a mild garlic flavour and make a nice flavouring in salads and cooked foods. Although produced abundantly, they are quite fiddly to use because they are small[K]. They can also be pickled[142].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.This species has the same medicinal virtues as garlic, but in a much milder and less effective form[238]. These virtues are as follows:- Garlic has a very long folk history of use in a wide range of ailments, particularly ailments such as ringworm, Candida and vaginitis where its fungicidal, antiseptic, tonic and parasiticidal properties have proved of benefit[218]. It is also said to have anticancer activity[218]. Daily use of garlic in the diet has been shown to have a very beneficial effect on the body, especially the blood system and the heart. For example, demographic studies suggest that garlic is responsible for the low incidence of arteriosclerosis in areas of Italy and Spain where consumption of the bulb is heavy[222]. The bulb is said to be anthelmintic, antiasthmatic, anticholesterolemic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, stimulant, stomachic, tonic, vasodilator[4, 9, 14, 21, 46, 165]. The crushed bulb may be applied as a poultice to ease the pain of bites, stings etc[4, 9, 14, 21].",,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].,,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1]. Succeeds in clay soils[203]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 8.3. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Closely allied to the wild leek, A. ampeloprasum, differing mainly in its having more bulbils and fewer flowers in the flowering head[17]. Plants can spread freely by means of their bulbils and sometimes become a weed in the garden[203]. Where the plant is found wild in Britain it might be as a relic of early cultivation in monasteries etc[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, though it can also be sown in a cold frame in the spring[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Well-grown plants can be planted out into their final positions in late summer or the autumn, otherwise grow them on for a further year in pots and plant them out the following summer. This species produces few if any seeds. Division in late summer or early autumn. Dig up the bulbs when the plants are dormant and divide the small bulblets at the base of the larger bulb. Replant immediately, either in the open ground or in pots in a cold frame. Bulbils - plant out as soon as they are ripe in late summer. The bulbils can be planted direct into their permanent positions, though you get better results if you pot them up and plant them out the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
