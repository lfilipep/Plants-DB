24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Plants can be grown from quite low elevations in the tropics up to an elevation of 2,500 metres or more[300 ]. They do not do well in hot, lowland tropical areas[335 ]. They appear to be tolerant of temperatures up to about 30°c[300 ], but are intolerant of frost[335 ]. They prefer an annual precipitation of around 1,500mm fairly evenly spread through the year since dry periods can lead to a check in growth[300 ]. Plants generally prefer a sunny position, but at lowland elevations they will often benefit from light shade[300 ]. Can succeed in a range of soils so long as they are rich in organic matter[300 ]. Prefers a light, fertile, well-drained soil[335 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7, tolerating 5.8 - 8[418 ]. Grows best in a position sheltered from strong winds[335 ]. Introduced into the Galapagos by settlers, it is considered to be invasive there[305 ]. Seedling plants generally commence fruiting when about 10 - 13 months old[335 ]. Annual yields of 1 - 2 tonnes of fruit per hectare are obtained[310 ]. Plants can flower and fruit all year round[335 ]. The flowers are hermaphrodite and plants are usually self-fertile[335 ]. The plant is susceptible to attack by nematodes and other pests, limiting its cultivation. In recent years its has been hybridized with various species, especially with S. Sessiliflorum, with the result that most plants grown and served in Ecuador comes from this hybrid. The hybrid can be distinguished from the true lulo by the colour of its fruit pulp: pure Solanum quitoense has bright green fruit pulp, whereas the hybrids most often have yellowish or, at most, light greenish fruit pulp[435 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Summer. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: 24-36 in. (60-90 cm)."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in a seedbed or in containers. Plant out when 10 - 15cm tall[300 ].
