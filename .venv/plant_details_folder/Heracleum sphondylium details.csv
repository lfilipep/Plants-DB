Used as a green vegetable, when harvested just as they are sprouting from the ground they are somewhat like asparagus in flavour[183]. The rind is somewhat acrid[115]. The leaf stems are tied in bundles and dried in the sun until they turn yellow[238]. A sweet substance resembling sugar forms on the dried stems and is considered to be a great delicacy[2, 115, 183, 238]. The peduncles, before flowering, can be eaten as a vegetable or added to soups[183]. Root - cooked. It is usually boiled[7]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, succeeding in any ordinary garden soil[1, 238], doing best in moist soils or deep woodland[1]. Grows well in full sun or partial shade[238]. This species contains a large number of sub-species. Some, but by no means all of them, can cause various problems as detailed at the top of this record. Subspecies transylvanicum, pyrenaicum, montanum, orsinii and alpinum are distinctly phototoxic, subspecies sphondylium and sibiricum are not phototoxic whilst subspecies granatense and ternatum vary in their toxicity[65]. A good bee plant[108]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow mid to late spring or early autumn in situ. Division in autumn.
