24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species, it probably requires a well drained soil in a sunny position and should be tolerant of clay since it favours clay soils in the wild. This species is believed to have hybridized with primitive forms of Triticum spp (Wheat) to produce some of the more modern Triticum spp. It could, therefore, be of value in wheat breeding programmes. It grows successfully at Kew, setting seed even in cool summers[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in situ and only just cover the seed. Make sure the soil does not dry out before the plants germinate. Seed can also be sown early March in a greenhouse and planted out in May.
