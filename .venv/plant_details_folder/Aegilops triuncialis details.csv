This species is believed to have hybridized with primitive forms of Triticum spp (Wheat) to produce some of the more modern Triticum spp. It could, therefore, be of value in wheat breeding programmes. It grows successfully at Kew, setting seed even in cool summers[K].",Seed - sow March/April in situ and only just cover the seed. Make sure the soil does not dry out before the plants germinate. Seed can also be sown early March in a greenhouse and planted out in May.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
