18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Immature flowering head - raw or cooked[K]. The plant forms a small cauliflower head in early spring. When this is harvested, another 6 - 12 smaller cauliflowers are produced on sideshoots[K]. The plants are not highly productive, but they are well-flavoured and make an excellent vegetable[K]. Leaves - raw or cooked. They have a mild cabbage flavour and can be harvested all year round, though be careful not to weaken the plant and thereby reduce the yield of flowering heads[K].",

23,Other Uses Description,An extract of the seeds inactivates the bacteria that causes black rot[201].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a position in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200]. Prefers a heavy soil. Succeeds in any reasonable soil. Succeeds in maritime gardens[200]. Nine star perennial broccoli is occasionally grown for its immature flower head, this is a perennial form of cauliflower that produces one small central cauliflower-like head and a number of smaller broccoli-like spears in early spring. Plants do not often live for more than 3 - 5 years. Grows well with celery and other aromatic plants since these seem to deter insect predations[18, 20, 201]. Grows badly with beet, tomatoes, onions and strawberries[20, 201].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April. Transplant into their permanent positions as soon as the plants are large enough and there is space in the garden. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported.",
