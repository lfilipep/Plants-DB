The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Shoots: ",,"Immature flowering head - raw or cooked[K]. The plant forms a small cauliflower head in early spring. When this is harvested, another 6 - 12 smaller cauliflowers are produced on sideshoots[K]. The plants are not highly productive, but they are well-flavoured and make an excellent vegetable[K]. Leaves - raw or cooked. They have a mild cabbage flavour and can be harvested all year round, though be careful not to weaken the plant and thereby reduce the yield of flowering heads[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Prefers a heavy soil. Succeeds in any reasonable soil. Succeeds in maritime gardens[200]. Nine star perennial broccoli is occasionally grown for its immature flower head, this is a perennial form of cauliflower that produces one small central cauliflower-like head and a number of smaller broccoli-like spears in early spring. Plants do not often live for more than 3 - 5 years. Grows well with celery and other aromatic plants since these seem to deter insect predations[18, 20, 201]. Grows badly with beet, tomatoes, onions and strawberries[20, 201].","Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April. Transplant into their permanent positions as soon as the plants are large enough and there is space in the garden. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
