0,Prunus insititia,Damson,Rosaceae,5-9,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Thickets, hedges and open woods[4, 17].",S. W. Asia.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",P. insititia. L.

More acid than a plum but it is very acceptable raw when fully ripe, especially after being touched by frost[12, 34, K]. The fruit is about 3cm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.","Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  Purgative  StypticThe bark of the root and branches is febrifuge and considerably styptic[4]. An infusion of the flowers has been used as a mild purgative for children[4]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.",A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168]. Trees are fairly wind resistant and can be grown as a shelterbelt hedge[200].,,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[1, 11]. Succeeds in light shade but fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers some chalk in the soil but apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[200]. It has been derived in cultivation from the bullace, differing in having a sweeter fruit[200]. Damsons can be grown successfully against a north facing wall[219]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
