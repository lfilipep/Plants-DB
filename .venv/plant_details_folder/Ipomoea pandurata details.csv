25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich well-drained loam in a warm sunny position[200]. The hardiest member of the genus, it tolerates frozen soil and should survive winter temperatures down to at least -10°c[260]. A climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around the branches of other plants[219]. A very ornamental plant[1]. This species has become a troublesome weed in many warm countries and is difficult to eradicate because of its deep root[219]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. Herbaceous. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water, or scarify the seed, and sow in individual pots in a greenhouse in early spring. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 weeks at 22°c. Plants are extremely resentful of root disturbance, even when they are quite small, and should be potted up almost as soon as they germinate[219]. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of side shoots in a peaty soil. Layering.",
