You can wash your hands by merely picking a couple of leaves or a bunch of blossom, wetting your hands and then rubbing the plant material vigorously as if it was a bar of soap[K]. This soap is a very gentle cleaner that does not remove the body's natural oils, but does remove dirt. It is not very effective against oil[K]. An infusion of the bark can also be used[99, 169]. The stems can be used in making fine coiled baskets[257].  - strong, very hard. Used for tool handles[99].",

23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately fertile soil, and also in thin soils over chalk[200]. Tolerates poor soils[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in semi-shade but prefers a position in full sun where it will flower more freely[182, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning, one third of the stems can be cut down to the ground each year in order to promote fresh growth and heavier flowering[202]. A very ornamental plant with aromatic flowers[182, 200]. This plant is the State flower of Idaho[212].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best if given 1 months cold stratification[113]. Sow February in a light position in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long side-shoots, July/August in a shaded frame. Plant out in spring. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 15 - 25cm with a heel, December in a sheltered bed outdoors. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in summer. Very easy.",
