They are usually avoided by grazing animals[274]. The leaves and the stems might be poisonous[20].","Swamps, wet thickets and shores[43].","N.

The plants have specialized roots for living in heavy wet soils. Some good edible, medicinal and other uses. Bloom Color: Pink, Purple.Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Upright or erect.","Asclepias incarnata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",,Bog Garden; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.,Shoots: ","Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.","nopened flower buds - cooked[46, 61, 161]. Tasting somewhat like peas[85]. They can also be dried and stored for later use[183]. Young shoots - cooked. An asparagus substitute[85, 106]. Tips of older shoots are cooked like spinach[85]. Young seed pods, harvested when 3 - 4 cm long - cooked. A pea-like flavour, they are very appetizing[85]. The flower clusters can be boiled down to make a sugary syrup[85].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Carminative  Diuretic  Emetic  Laxative  StomachicA tea made from the roots is anthelmintic, carminative, diuretic, emetic, strongly laxative and stomachic[4, 61, 222, 257]. The tea is said to remove tapeworms from the body in one hour[257]. It has also been used in the treatment of asthma, rheumatism, syphilis, worms and as a heart tonic[4, 207, 222]. An infusion of the roots is used as a strengthening bath for children and adults[257].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Pollution: Plants used to combat pollution.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.,Wax: Used for making candles etc.","A good quality fibre is obtained from the bark[46, 57, 61, 95, 112, 169]. It is used in twine, cloth etc[112]. It is easily harvested in late autumn, after the plants have died down, by simply pulling it off the dead stems[112]. The seed floss is used to stuff pillows etc or is mixed with other fibres to make cloth[57, 171]. It is a Kapok substitute, it is used in Life Jackets or as a stuffing material[169, 171]. It is very water repellent. The floss has also been used to mop up oil spills at sea. Rubber can be made from latex contained in the leaves and stems[57]. Pods contain an oil and a wax which are of potential importance[171]. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed finer or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1].","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.","Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: HayLandscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Massing. Prefers a well-drained light rich or peaty soil[1, 200]. Requires a moist soil and a sunny position, doing well by water[111, 134]. Succeeds on dry soils and on all soil types[112]. Plants are hardy to at least -25°c[187]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are very attractive to butterflies[169]. The flower of many members of this genus can trap insects between its anther cells, the struggles of the insect in escaping ensure the pollination of the plant[207]. Many members of this genus seem to be particularly prone to damage by slugs. The young growth in spring is especially vulnerable, but older growth is also attacked and even well-established plants have been destroyed in wet years[K]. Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted into their final positions whilst small[134].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 2. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn or in late winter[134, 169]. We have also had good results from sowing the seed in the greenhouse in early spring[K], though stored seed might need 2 - 3 weeks cold stratification[134]. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 3 months at 18°c[134]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out when they are in active growth in late spring or early summer and give them some protection from slugs until they are growing away strongly. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and place them in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse until they are growing away strongly, then plant them out in the summer, giving them some protection from slugs until they are established.. Basal cuttings in late spring. Use shoots about 10cm long with as much of their white underground stem as possible. Pot them up individually and place them in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse until they are rooting and growing actively. If the plants grow sufficiently, they can be put into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in the greenhouse until the following spring and when they are in active growth plant them out into their permanent positions. Give them some protection from slugs until they are established.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
