13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Larix sibirica is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft 5in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 1 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
20,Other Uses,"Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The bark is a commercial source of tannin in N. Europe[223]. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 21.2% tannin[223].  - strong, heavy and durable. Used for construction, bridge building, vehicles, poles, and making furniture[50, 229, 266].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers an open airy position in a light or gravelly well-drained soil[200]. Plants are intolerant of badly drained soils, but they tolerate acid and infertile soils[200]. Succeeds on rocky hill or mountain sides and slopes[200]. A north or east aspect is more suitable than west or south[1]. This species is very cold-hardy when fully dormant, but the trees can be excited into premature growth in Britain by mild spells during the winter and they are then very subject to damage by late frosts and cold winds[1]. The tree often comes into growth in January or February and is then very susceptible to frost damage[185]. A 56 year old tree at Kew in 1956 had only reached 4 metres tall and was dying[185]. It is impossible to grow this tree in lowland Britain, though it should succeed above a height of 300 metres in the eastern Scottish Highlands[200]. Growth is normally slow in Britain with average height increases of less than 30cm per year[185]. Trees are planted for timber in Asia and Northern Europe, especially in Sweden and Finland[50, 266]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Open ground plants, 1 year x 1 year are the best for planting out, do not use container grown plants with spiralled roots[200]. Plants transplant well, even when coming into growth in the spring[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in pots in a cold frame. One months cold stratification helps germination[113]. It is best to give the seedlings light shade for the first year[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots. Although only a few centimetres tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer providing you give them an effective weed-excluding mulch and preferably some winter protection for their first year. Otherwise grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year. The seed remains viable for 3 years[113] If you are growing larger quantities of plants, you can sow the seed in an outdoor seedbed in late winter. Grow on the seedlings in the seedbed for a couple of years until they are ready to go into their permanent positions then plant them out during the winter.",
