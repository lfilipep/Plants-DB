14,Physical Characteristics,"Acacia coriacea is an evergreen Tree growing to 5 m (16ft 5in) at a medium rate. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked. Sweet and nutritious[193]. The seed contains about 20% protein[193]. The seed ranges from 4 - 10mm long and 4 - 6mm wide. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain approx 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat[278]. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present[278]. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated which is a distinct health advantage although it presents storage problems as such fats readily oxidise[278]. The mean total carbohydrate content of 55.8 + 13.7% is lower than that of lentils, but higher than that of soybeans while the mean fibre content of 32.3 + 14.3% is higher than that of other legumes such as lentils with a level of 11.7%[278]. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480+270 kJ per 100g[278]. Wattle seeds are low glycaemic index foods. The starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise[278]. Flowers - cooked[144]. Rich in pollen, they are often used in fritters.",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. The extensive root system of this plant helps to prevent soil erosion[200]. The wood has been used for making small tools and implements[278].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen. Prefers a sandy loam and a very sunny position[1]. Succeeds in dry soils. Succeeds in any good garden soil that is not excessively limey[11]. Most species become chlorotic on limey soils[200]. Trees are very tolerant of maritime exposure in their native environment, though they are often severely wind-shaped and can be semi-prostrate[285]. Trees are not very hardy outdoors in Britain, even in the mildest areas of the country they are likely to be killed in excessively harsh winters[11]. This is one of the most drought-tolerant tropical acacias of North and North West Australia, being able to survive years with no more than 50 mm of rain in 20 days in its native area of distribution. Rainfall in its native habitat varies from 200 to 500 mm. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer and consider giving some protection from winter cold for their first year or two outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Fair percentage[78].",
