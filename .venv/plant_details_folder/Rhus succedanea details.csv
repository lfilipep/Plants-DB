0,Rhus succedanea,Wax Tree,Anacardiaceae,4-9,This plant contains toxic substances which can cause severe irritation to some people. The fresh sap causes skin blisters[145]. The leaves contain the ubiquitous carcinogen shikimic acid[218].,"Forests and shrubberies to 2,400 metres in the Himalayas[51 ].

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Toxicodendron succedaneum.

The edible fruit contains ellagic acid[218]. These reports need to be treated with some caution due to the general toxicity of the species[K].","Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Used as a wash to counteract varnish poisoning[178]. Use with extreme caution, see notes above on toxicity. The fruit is used in the treatment of phthisis[240]. A wax from the fruits is used in ointments[218]. An ethanolic extract of the leaves exhibits anticancer and antiviral activities[218].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Lacquer: A type of varnish.,Mordant: Used for making a dye more permanent, it also affects the colour of the dye.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Varnish: Plants that can be used as a varnish without any special treatment. Does not include varnishes made from oils etc.,Wax: Used for making candles etc.","The leaves contain about 20% tannin[218]. They can be collected as they fall in the autumn and used as a brown dye or as a mordant[169]. The sap is tapped and used as a lacquer[57, 64, 146, 158, 171]. It is much used in Japanese art and needs to be kept in a cool humid place for it to dry properly. The Japanese traditionally kept their paintings in a damp cave until the lacquer had dried. A yellow dye is obtained from the wood[178]. A wax obtained from the fruit is used to make candles, floor wax, varnish etc[1, 4, 11, 51, 64, 158, 171]. The fruit contains about 17% wax[174]. The fatty acid composition of the wax is 77% palmitic, 5% stearic and arachidic, 6% dibasic, 12% oleic and a trace of linoleic[218]. The seed oil contains 25% glycerides of palmitic, 47% oleic and 28% linoleic[218].","Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel.

Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Oil  Industrial Crop: Wax  Management: Standard  Regional CropSucceeds in a well-drained fertile soil in full sun[11, 200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, though they succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[1, 11]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants have brittle branches and these can be broken off in strong winds[200]. Plants are also susceptible to coral spot fungus[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species is frequently cultivated in Japan for its sap and the wax obtained from its fruit[11]. Many of the species in this genus, including this one, are highly toxic and can also cause severe irritation to the skin of some people, whilst other species are not poisonous. It is relatively simple to distinguish which is which, the poisonous species have axillary panicles and smooth fruits whilst non-poisonous species have compound terminal panicles and fruits covered with acid crimson hairs[1, 4]. The toxic species are sometimes separated into their own genus, Toxicodendron, by some botanists[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water (starting at a temperature of 80 - 90c and allowing it to cool) prior to sowing in order to leach out any germination inhibitors[200]. The stored seed also needs hot water treatment and can be sown in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long taken in December and potted up vertically in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78, 200]. Suckers in late autumn to winter[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
