1,Common Name,"Crab Apple, European crab apple"
2,Family,Rosaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Woods, scrub and hedges, especially in oak woods, on neutral to calcareous soils[9, 17, 200]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Malus sylvestris is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"TeaFruit - raw or cooked[9, 15]. Used for jellies, preserves and juices[183]. The flavour improves considerably if the fruit is not harvested until it has been frosted[12]. The fruit is quite variable in size (it is about 2 - 4cm in diameter[200]) and quality. Whilst usually harsh and acid, some forms are quite sweet and can be eaten out of hand[K]. The fruit is rich in pectin and can be used in helping other fruits to set when making jam etc[61, 142]. Pectin is also said to protect the body against radiation[201]. An edible oil can be obtained from the seed[4]. It would only really be viable to use these seeds as an oil source if the fruit was being used for some purpose such as making cider and then the seeds could be extracted from the remaining pulp[K]. A very pleasant tea can be made from the leaves[7]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Refrigerant: Cools the body."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antibacterial  Astringent  Hypnotic  Laxative  RefrigerantThe fruit is astringent and laxative[4, 9]. The crushed fruit pulp can be used as a poultice to heal inflammations or small flesh wounds[7]. The fruit is eaten to obviate constipation[240]. The bark, and especially the root bark, is anthelmintic, refrigerant and soporific[218, 240]. An infusion is used in the treatment of intermittent, remittent and bilious fevers[4, 240]. The leaves contain up to 2.4% of an antibacterial substance called 'florin'[240]. This inhibits the growth of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in as low a concentration as 30 ppm[240]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Pectin: A substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,Pectin: A substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories."
23,Other Uses Description,"The fruit is a source of pectin[61, 142].  is used as a thickener in jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories. A red to yellow dye is obtained from the bark[257]. The wood is an excellent fuel[67]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, including heavy ones, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 98, 200]. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[186, 200]. Fairly tolerant of cutting, it succeeds in a mixed hedgerow[186]. A parent of the cultivated apple[11], it is often used as a rootstock[50]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. The plant has over 90 associated insect species[24]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11]."
