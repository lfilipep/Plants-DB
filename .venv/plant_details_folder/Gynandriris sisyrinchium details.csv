24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a stiff limey soil in full sun[42]. Tolerates some shade[79]. Plants need plenty of moisture whilst in growth in winter and spring, but need a dry soil when they die down in the summer[188]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200], and in general does not do well in this country[1]. It requires a summer baking to ripen the roots and ensure good flowering in the following year[200]. It should be planted about 10 - 15cm deep[79]. It is probably best grown in a bulb frame[K]. The flowers usually open in the afternoon and are faded by the morning[90]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[1]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division."
