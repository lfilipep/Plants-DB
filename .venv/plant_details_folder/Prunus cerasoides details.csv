0,Prunus cerasoides,Wild Himalayan Cherry,Rosaceae,7-10,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Forests, 1200 - 2400 metres[51]. Forests in ravines at elevations of 700 - 3700 metres in western China[266].",E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower in April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",P. puddum. Kingdon-Ward.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"Fruit - raw or cooked[51, 105, 158, 272]. Acid and astringent, they are only occasionally eaten raw but are more often cooked[183]. The fruit is about 15mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Gum - chewed. Obtained from the trunk, it can be employed as a substitute for gum tragacanth[183], see Astragalus spp. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentThe fruit is astringent[272]. The juice of the bark is applied externally to treat backaches[272]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Beads: Used as necklaces etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168]. The seeds are used as beads in necklaces and rosaries[51, 146, 158, 272].  - moderately hard, strong, durable, aromatic[158]. The branches are used as walking sticks[51, 146, 158, 272].",,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Requires an open sunny sheltered position[166]. Not very hardy in Britain[1] but it succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[166]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
