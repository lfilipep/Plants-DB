18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"An infusion of the seeds, obtained by soaking them in water overnight, is a cooling drink[310 ]. People place bunches of the branches in containers of drinking water, and claim that the water is thus kept cool, as if iced[331 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antibilious: Corrects the secretions of bile.,Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea.

See Febrifuge.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stings: Used in the treatment of stings and insect bites.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antibilious  Antibiotic  Antidiarrhoeal  Antidote  Antihaemorrhoidal  Antipyretic  Aphrodisiac  Bitter  Blood purifier  Diuretic  Dysentery  Eczema  Emetic  Febrifuge  Hepatic  Hypoglycaemic  Hypotensive  Kidney  Parasiticide  Skin  Stings  StomachicOriginally from the American tropics, sweet broom has spread as a weed throughout the tropics and been widely taken up as a medicinal herb wherever it goes. It has a very wide range of uses in tropical America where it is used to treat conditions such as digestive problems, pulmonary complaints, fevers and skin disorders,[348 ]. The plant is seen as an antibilious, antibiotic, antidote, aphrodisiac, bitter, blood purifier, emetic, febrifuge, hepatic, hypoglycaemic and stomachic[348 ]. The roots, leaves and tops are traditionally used in India, Indo-China and South-East Asia as an analgesic, diuretic and antipyretic, to treat gastric disorders such as diarrhoea and dysentery, and also for cough, bronchitis, hypertension, haemorrhoids and insect bites[310 ]. Research has shown that the plant contains a number of medically active compounds - the aerial parts contain about 4% of a viscous oil which, besides fatty acids like stearic, myristic and linolenic acid, also contains a series of diterpenes[310 ]. The aerial parts also yield nitrogen-containing components and flavonoids[310 ]. Scopadulin, a diterpene from the aerial parts, has shown mild antiviral activity[310 ]. The antiviral activity of scopadulciol, a tetracyclic diterpenoid, was found to inhibit the virus replication, as shown by reduction of virus production[310 ]. Scopadulcic acid B has been shown to have a tumour-inhibiting action and has also been shown to inhibit replication of herpes simplex virus type 1[310 ]. The fresh stems and leaves contain a compound called amellin, thought by some to have an important therapeutic action in diabetes; however, others doubt this[310 ]. Oral administration of amellin relieves symptoms of glycosuria, reduces hyperglycaemia and increases RBC count. It has also been found helpful in anaemia, albuminuria, ketonuria, retinitis and other complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Unlike insulin, amellin does not cause blood sugar levels to drop below normal and reduction of both blood and urine sugar occurs gradually[310 ]. In a clinical trial, 25 healthy people and 30 with gingivitis were given mouthwashes containing 1% aqueous extract of the plant or 0.02% chlorhexidine gluconate for 6 weeks. There was a slight increase in gingival inflammation in people with gingivitis using the extract, but the antiplaque activity was similar to that of 0.02% chlorhexidine[310 ]. The whole plant is used for treating a wide range of disorders including diabetes, herpes, coughs and colds, fevers, nausea, dizziness, and as an antidote for snakebites and cassava intoxication. In low doses, often in milk, it is used to relieve vomiting in infants, whilst in larger does it is used to induce vomiting to clear out the digestive system[348 ]. A decoction of the plant is drunk as a treatment for remittent fever and gonorrhoea, and also to induce labour[310 ]. A cold decoction of the plant is taken as a remedy for gravel and kidney complaints[310 , 348 ]. The fresh or dried plants are used externally to treat a wide range of skin problems, including pimples, impetigo, ulcers, eczema, bruises and contusions[310 , 348 ]. An infusion of the herb is used as a mouthwash for infected gums[310 ]. The leaves are chewed to treat cough; they first taste bitter and later sweet (like liquorice)[310 ]. They were formerly used in the treatment of diabetes[310 ]. The leaves are macerated in warm water and drunk copiously when cooled in the treatment of feverish headaches[310 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes used as a sand binder[310 , 317 ]. Other Uses: The bushy stems are much used to make temporary brooms for sweeping floors, and there is a belief that they destroy fleas[331 ]. The fresh or dried plants are said to kill fleas, lice and intestinal worms[310 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A common weed of lowland tropical and subtropical areas, found in areas where it rains all year round and also where there is a prolonged dry season[310 ]. Succeeds in most soils[310 ]. This is one of the half dozen commonest weeds of Central America, and may be found almost anywhere in the lowlands[331 ]. Plants can flower and fruit all year round[310 ]. The plant is a probable host for the coconut-yellows-disease, caused by a mycoplasma-like organism[310 ]. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: 6-9 in. (15-22 cm)."
