0,Archidendron jiringa,"Jengkol, Jiringa",Fabaceae,10-12,"Djenkolic acid, an amino acid derivative, has been found in the seed. Ingestion of the seed can cause the formation of sharp needle-like crystals of djenkolic acid in the kidney or urinary tract. In severe cases, crystals of djenkolic acid have been found in urine. Indeed, people who are suffering from djenkolism show similar symptoms to those suffering from kidney or urinary stones, a condition for which it has been frequently mistaken[ 306 ].","Forests of humid and mountainous areas, as well as along river banks[ 306 ].

It has a spreading crown, compound bipinnate leaves, cream to white clustered flowers, and a dark brown pod fruit. Seeds are believed to relieve diabetes symptoms. Burnt old leaves can be used against itching while burnt young leaves can be used as wound powder for cuts. Seeds are edible - either raw or cooked. However, seeds can contain djenkolic acid which is an amino acid that is toxic and causes djenkolism. Young leaves are cooked and the very young shoots and flowers are eaten as vegetables. Fruits are also edible. Further, Jengkol is a great source of purple dye for silk, black dye, and reddish dye. The pods are used as a shampoo. The bark, leaves, and seeds have insecticidal properties. The wood is soft and used for cabinet work and for fuel.","Archidendron jiringa is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Moths, insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Albizia jiringa (Jack) Kurz Feuilleea jiringa (Jack) O.Kuntze Inga jiringa Jack ex DC.

Seed - raw or cooked[ 301 ]. The seed has a powerful odour that many people find objectionable[ 63 ]. Young seeds are often eaten raw[ 303 ]. Generally the young seeds are believed to have a better flavour than older ones, though some people prefer to eat germinating mature seeds[ 306 ]. The seedpod is 20 - 25cm long and 3 - 4cm wide, twisted in a wide spiral[ 418 ]. Mature seeds contain djenkolic acid and need careful preparation to neutralize it. Traditionally, they are boiled in three changes of water[ 451 ]. Sometimes the seeds are boiled in a mixture of water, wood ash, bamboo leaves and pieces of steel or nails, discarding the cook water a number of times[ 306 ]. The resulting beans are said to be highly nutritious[ 306 ]. Other ways in which the seeds are prepared are:- 1). Boiled thoroughly till the offensive smell has disappeared, then consumed with salt and grated coconut[ 303 ]. 2). Steeped for a couple of hours in salt water, before being fried in oil. This also removes most of the bad smell[ 303 ]. 3). Made into a local delicacy, called emping. After cooking, the cotyledons are flattened by hammering them one by one into the shape of small cakes which are sun-dried, and fried in coconut oil and sprinkled with salt before consumption[ 301 , 303 ]. 4). Buried for 14 days until they germinate, then dug up and washed clean, whilst at the same time the sprouts are cut off and thrown away[ 303 ]. The latter way of preparation is said to minimize the danger of intoxication by jengkolic acid, crystals of which can cause kidney failure. It is recommended to drink much water when eating the seeds[ 303 ]. A starch is also extracted from the seed[ 301 ]. Young leaves - cooked[ 46 , 301 ]. The very young wine-red shoots are consumed raw as a vegetable[ 303 ]. Flowers[ 301 ]. Eaten as a vegetable[ 46 ].

Other Uses The pods have been used as a source of purple dye for silk[ 303 , 451 ]. The bark and leaves are used for dyeing matting black[ 303 , 451 ].

The pulverised seeds are used, they are rich in saponins[ 317 ]. The bark, leaves and seeds have insecticidal properties[ 317 ]. The heartwood is white, the sapwood white or pinkish-white.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30c, but can tolerate 12 - 40c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 4,000mm[ 418 ]. Grows well in full sun and in light shade[ 418 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil[ 303 ].
