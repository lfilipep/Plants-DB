Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer, Mid fall. Form: Upright or erect.","Helianthus maximilianii is a PERENNIAL growing to 2.4 m (7ft 10in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from September to October, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Tubers - raw or cooked[22, 46, 61, 257]. Similar in flavour to Jerusalem artichokes, but lower yielding. Seed - raw or cooked[183].

Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein-oilLandscape Uses:Border, Container, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils in a sunny position[1]. Requires a rich soil[1]. Dislikes shade[1]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, plants can be totally destroyed by them[K]. At least one named form has been developed. Called 'Prairie Gold', it is being investigated by the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas for its oil-seed potential in a non-tillage permaculture system[183]. The yield of edible tubers is not very high. This species is closely related to H. giganteus[1]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Plants have a running root system and can be invasive[1]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
