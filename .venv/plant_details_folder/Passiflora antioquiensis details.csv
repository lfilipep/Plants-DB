24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of higher elevations in the moister tropics[335 ]. It can also be grown successfully at lower elevations in the tropics and subtropics[262 ]. Tolerant of occasional slight frosts[262 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade[262 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Plants require a temperature no lower than around 16°c when they are flowering in order to ensure fruit set[200 ]. Plants produce tendrils and climb by attaching these to other plants. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for the stored seeds to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24°c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262 ]. Cuttings of fully mature wood taken at a node. They can take 3 months, but there is usually a high percentage[3 ]. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering."
