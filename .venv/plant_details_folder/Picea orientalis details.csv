Form: Pyramidal.,"Picea orientalis is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ","Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","catkins - raw or cooked.

It is also valued for its use in the pulp industry to make paper[171].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Likes abundant moisture at the roots, if grown in drier areas it must be given a deep moist soil[11]. Tolerates poor peaty soils[200]. Succeeds in wet cold and shallow soils but is not very wind-firm in shallow soils[1]. Prefers a pH between 4 to 6[200]. Dislikes shade[200]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[11]. Resists wind exposure to some degree[200]. In some upland areas, especially over granitic or other base-poor soils, growth rate and health have been seriously affected by aluminium poisoning induced by acid rain[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. There are a number of named forms selected for their ornamental value, most of these are dwarf cultivars[200]. Young trees are slow growing at first but from the age of about 5 - 6 years they can grow up to 1 metre a year and this can be maintained for the next 70 years or so. Growth virtually ceases by the time the tree is 90 - 100 years old[185]. Increases in girth follow the same pattern as height increases[185]. Trees probably do not live much longer than 100 years in Britain[185]. They are occasionally planted on a small scale in Europe as a timber tree[50]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. The bruised leaves have a resinous aroma[245]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - stratification will probably improve germination so sow fresh seed in the autumn in a cold frame if possible[80]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[78]. A position in light shade is probably best[78]. Seed should not be allowed to dry out and should be stored in a cool place[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, or be placed in an outdoor nursery bed for a year or so to increase in size. They might need protection from spring frosts. Cuttings of semi-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 8cm long, August in a frame. Protect from frost. Forms roots in the spring[78]. Cuttings of mature terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, September/October in a cold frame. Takes 12 months[78]. Cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, early summer in a frame.
