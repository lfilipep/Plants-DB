21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The light yellow wood is made up entirely of sapwood. The texture is very fine; the grain straight; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is very strong, extremely hard, elastic; durable. It is moderately difficult to work because of its high density, but finishes smoothly and is excellent for turnery. Said to be the equal of boxwood in hardness, it is used for making fishing rods, billiard cues, archery bows, articles of turnery, masts, textile machinery, and small tool handles[316 , 448 ].",
