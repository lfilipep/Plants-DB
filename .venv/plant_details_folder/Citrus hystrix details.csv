24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Kaffir lime is a thorny, multi-stemmed, evergreen shrub or small tree. Three main climates are suitable for commercial citrus production - tropical climates, subtropical with winter rain in the Mediterranean and semitropical with summer rainfall in Florida and southern Brazil [200 ]. Kaffir lime grows well in sandy, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Deep, fertile soils generally produce the best fruit crops. Best overall performance occurs in full sun in locations sheltered from strong winds [2-2]. The optimal temperatures for citrus cultivation range between 25 - 30°c, with the coldest month having an average minimum of at least 15°c [200 ]. Growth generally ceases below 13°c and above 38°c[200 ]. If there are dry periods of more than three months, then irrigation will be necessary [200 ]. Kaffir lime can tolerate occasional, short-lived frosts [377 ]. An easily grown plant [306 ] preferring deep, well-drained but moisture-retentive loamy soil in full sun [200 ].  Kaffir lime prefers a pH in the range of 5 - 6 [200 ]. Self Pollinating. Suitable for pots. Can be pruned to 2m."
26,Plant Propagation,"After thoroughly rinsing it, the seed is best sown in containers as soon as ripe [164, 200 ]. Sow stored seed in containers as quickly as possible]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 13°c. Seedlings are liable to damp off, so they must be watered with care and kept well ventilated. The seed is usually polyembryonic; two or more seedlings arise from each seed. They are genetically identical to the parent but do not usually carry any virus present in the parent plant[200 ]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them until they are 10cm or taller before planting them into their permanent positions. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. This species grows easily from cuttings[200 ]. Layering."
