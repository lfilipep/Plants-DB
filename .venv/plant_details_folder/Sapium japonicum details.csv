24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sunny position in any well-drained fertile soil[200]. Requires the protection of a south or south-west facing wall when grown in areas at the limits of its hardiness[200]. Although not very hardy outdoors in Britain, the plant tolerates several degrees of frost and so can be grown against a sunny wall in favoured parts of the country[200]. A specimen seen growing outdoors at Hilliers Arboretum in Hampshire, but in the shade of other trees, was carrying a heavy crop of unripe seeds in September 1994[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - do not cold stratify the seed since this can lead to secondary dormancy. Sown in April in a warm greenhouse, it usually germinates within 4 weeks[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Overwinter in a greenhouse for at least their first 2 winters and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame.",
