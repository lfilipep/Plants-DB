The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",S. bonplandianus. S. dependens.

It requires a sunny position in a poor rather than rich soil[182, 200]. Plants are very variable in their cold tolerance depending on their provenance, most forms are not very hardy outdoors in Britain but selected forms succeed when grown against a sunny wall[11]. A plant growing in a fairly sunny position, but under quite dense tree cover, at Hilliers Arboretum in Hampshire is thriving and had set a large crop of fruit in September 1996[K]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance[11]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a warm greenhouse in mid spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter before planting out in early summer[K].
