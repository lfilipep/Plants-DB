It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Bulb - raw or cooked[2]. A strong onion flavour, it can be used in salads, as a cooked vegetable or as a flavouring in cooked foods[22, K]. The bulbs are rather small, usually 10 - 25mm in diameter though they can be up to 45mm[266], and are sometimes used as spring onions[183]. A nutritional analysis is available[218]. Leaves - raw or cooked[2]. They have a mild onion flavour[183] and can be added to salads or cooked as a vegetable[116]. The leaves are often available all through the winter if the weather is not too severe[K]. They contain about 1.4% protein, 0.3% fat, 4.6% carbohydrate, 0.8% ash, some vitamin B1 and moderate levels of vitamin C[179]. Flowers - raw. A pleasant onion flavour, but they are rather on the dry side[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antifungal  Antipyretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Stomachic  Vitamin CThe bulb contains an essential oil that is rich in sulphur compounds[283]. It is antibacterial, antiseptic, diaphoretic, diuretic, galactogogue, stomachic, vermifuge and vulnerary[176, 218]. It is used in the treatment of colds and abdominal coldness and fullness[176]. A tea made from the roots is a children's sedative[218]. Use of the bulb in the diet impedes internal parasites[218]. Externally, the bulb can be made into a poultice to drain pus from sores, boils and abscesses[254]."
22,Other Uses,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[203], it prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1] but tolerates most soils[1, 52] including those that are damp and acid[203]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 to 7.5[206], but it tolerates a pH in the range 4.9 to 7.5. A very hardy species, it is related to the cultivated onion (A. cepa) and could be of value in breeding programmes. It is sometimes cultivated in the garden for its edible leaves which can be produced throughout the winter if the weather is not too severe[K]. A very popular cultivated vegetable in the Orient[206], it probably arose through cultivation from A. altaicum[203]. The oriental forms of this species, known as bunching onions, tend to be hardier and more robust than the welsh onion[206]. There are two basic forms, multi-stem types and single-stem types. The single-stem types divide less freely than the multi-stems[206]. Plants will often retain their leaves even when covered in snow[206]. They are also tolerant of high temperatures and can be grown in the tropics[206]. The plants are often eaten by slugs[K]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a bulb."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. The seed germinates over a wide range of temperatures, it is faster at higher temperatures[206]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. When well-grown, the plants should be ready to be planted out in the summer. If they are not large enough at this time, grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring. Division of the plants is very easy and can be done at almost any time of the year though the spring is probably best. The divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions if required."
