25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. See the plants native habitat for ideas on the conditions it will require."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. Only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the spring. Division in the spring might be possible.
