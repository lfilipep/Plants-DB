17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.",

22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the flowers and the leaves[154, 200]. Used in perfumery[200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich well-drained lime-free sandy soil in a sunny sheltered position[200]. One form of this species is resistant to salt spray[157]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. One report says that the plants might succeed on a wall in the milder areas of this country[166], another says that they require greenhouse protection[1] and yet another says that they can be grown outdoors in tubs during the summer but need to be bought indoors in the winter[200]. Plants can flower in their first year from seed if they are pot grown and the young shoot tips are pinched out constantly[78].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse at 15°c[78, 138]. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place within 4 - 9 weeks at 24°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe shoot tips or side shoots, 5 - 10cm preferably with a heel, July/August in a frame[78].",
