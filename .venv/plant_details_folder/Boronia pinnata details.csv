Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut.

A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. One report says that the plants might succeed on a wall in the milder areas of this country[166], another says that they require greenhouse protection[1] and yet another says that they can be grown outdoors in tubs during the summer but need to be bought indoors in the winter[200]. Plants can flower in their first year from seed if they are pot grown and the young shoot tips are pinched out constantly[78].","Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse at 15°c[78, 138]. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place within 4 - 9 weeks at 24°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe shoot tips or side shoots, 5 - 10cm preferably with a heel, July/August in a frame[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
