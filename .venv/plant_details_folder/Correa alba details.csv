Another report says that plants do best in a well-drained, rather poor soil with some limestone[260]. Plants are very resistant to salt spray[157]. This species is hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. Plants can tolerate at least short-lived frosts down to about -5°c in Britain[200] and they can be grown on a sunny wall in the milder parts of the country[1, 166]. In S. Cornwall they succeed as free-growing shrubs[1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Fresh seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Stored seed can be difficult to germinate, leaching with water can help, or perhaps a short burst of fire will initiate germination[260]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a shaded frame[200]. Cuttings are generally quite easy to root[260].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
