Tolerates a wide range of soil types, succeeding in any moderately fertile retentive soil[200]. Calcicole[50]. Established plants are drought resistant[190]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[187]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, virtually every bit of a divided plant, whether it has roots or not, will grow away and produce roots[190]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
