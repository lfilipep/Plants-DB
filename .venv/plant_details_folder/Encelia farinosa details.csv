24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen. Requires a very warm sunny position in a deep very well-drained soil[200, 260]. Plants strongly resent wet conditions, especially in the winter[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Another report says that the plants will tolerate temperatures down to -12°c if they are in quite dry conditions[260]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Plants have a taproot and resent root disturbance[200]. They should be planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small, though they will then need protection from the cold for their first winter or so[K]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed and pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle[200]. Grow on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter, making sure the pots are deep enough to accommodate the tap root, and plant out in early summer. Cuttings, in pure sand, in a frame[200]. The report does not specify the type of cutting.",
