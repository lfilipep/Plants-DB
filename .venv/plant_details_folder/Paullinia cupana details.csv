The sweetened paste, called Brazilian chocolate, is used in soft drinks, candy etc[301 ]. The seeds contain 2.7 - 7% caffeine as well as the stimulants theophylline and theobromine[254 , 303 ]. The seeds contain up to 7% of a caffeine-like compound known as guaranine, which is not addictive and takes longer to be metabolized, giving it a gentler, more sustained stimulating effect[238 ]. The seeds are also roasted, pounded, and used as a flavouring in bread[418 ].",

It is an astringent, bitter, diuretic herb with a strong, stimulant effect[238 , 254 ]. The seed is said to be antipyretic, antineuralgic and antidiarrhoeal, and is also reputed to be a powerful stimulant, an analgesic comparable to aspirin and an anti-influenza agent[303 ]. The Rainforest tribes have used guarana mainly as a stimulant, astringent and in treating chronic diarrhoea[303 ]. The powdered seed is taken internally to relieve fatigue, aid concentration and lift the spirits[238 ]. One report says that overuse can cause sleeplessness, although less so than caffeine-based drinks[238 ], whilst others say that the stimulating effect is due to caffeine[254 , 303 ]. A useful short-term remedy for boosting energy levels, though it tends to inhibit the body's natural restorative processes if used in the longer term[254 ].

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Guarana is a plant of the humid lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 800 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 32°c, but can tolerate 18 - 38°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about 10°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 2,500mm, but tolerates 1,100 - 3,000mm[418 ]. It does not like a dry season[303 ]. Prefers a position in full sun, also succeeding in light shade[303 , 418 ]. The plant requires a soil that is deep, medium or heavy in texture, well drained and with high organic matter content[303 ]. Traditionally, plants are grown on very acid soils of low fertility with high concentrations of aluminium[303 ]. It grows naturally on gley soils with a pH in the range 3.5 - 4.5[303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 4 - 5.5, tolerating 3.5 - 6.5[418 ]. Bloom Color: White/Near White.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - must be sown as soon as it is ripe since it loses viability within 72 hours[303 ]. Germination can take more than 100 days[303 ].,
