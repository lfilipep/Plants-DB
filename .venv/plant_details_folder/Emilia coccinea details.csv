25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[1], succeeding in most well-drained soils in a sunny position[200]. An ideal plant for hot dry areas and coastal soils[188]. Plants flower better when growing on nutritionally poor soils, producing much lusher growth on rich soils[200]. They are drought tolerant once established[200]. Plants are not frost hardy, but succeed outdoors in Britain as a spring-sown annual[200]. Slugs can be a problem with this plant in a wet spring[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts[1, 200]. The seed can also be sown outdoors in situ in the middle of spring[1, 200].",
