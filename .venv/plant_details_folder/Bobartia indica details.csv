23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very sunny position and a gritty soil[1, 42, 79]. Plants prefer a moist winter followed by a dry summer[260]. Succeeds in poor acidic soils[282]. Plants require protection from severe frosts (below about -5°c) and excessive rain, but they are otherwise hardy in Britain[1, 200]. Individual flowers are about 5cm in diameter and only live for one day[260]. The rhizomes establish themselves very deeply in the soil[42]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest that the seed is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Sow stored seed in early spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow on the plants in the greenhouse for at least the first winter planting them out in late spring. Division in autumn[1]."
