A fast growing species, established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and compacted soils[200]. This species is hardy in most areas of Britain but the trees do not do well in northern parts of the country, requiring hotter summers than are normally experienced there[98]. A very ornamental and very long lived tree[1]. It is immune to 'Plane tree wilt' fungus[11]. Very tolerant of root disturbance, trees up to 5 metres tall can be moved quite easily[200].","Seed - two months cold stratification improves germination[113]. Sow spring in a cold frame in light shade[78, 98]. Home grown seed is often of poor quality and low viability. It is best to harvest the seed in late winter or spring and then sow it immediately in a cold frame[80]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.
