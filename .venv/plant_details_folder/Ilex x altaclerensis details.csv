0,Ilex x altaclerensis,Holly,Aquifoliaceae,5-9,"Although no specific reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, the fruits of at least some members of this genus contain saponins and are slightly toxic. They can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and stupor if eaten in quantity[274]. The fruit is poisonous[177].",Not known in the wild.,"A hybrid of garden origin, I. aquifolium x I. perado.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/IlexXAltaclerensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Ilex x altaclerensis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","Makes a good windbreak hedge, succeeding even in exposed maritime areas, though it is slow growing. The vars. 'Hendersonii' (f), 'Hodginsii' (m) and 'Maderensis' (m) are especially noted[75].",,"Succeeds in most soils so long as they are not water-logged[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dormant plants are hardy to about -15°c if they are given shelter from cold drying winds[184]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Tolerates industrial pollution and maritime exposure[200]. Slow growing. Plants are very tolerant of trimming and can be pruned right back into old wood. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[182]. Dislikes root disturbance, especially as it gets older[11]. It is best to place the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, perhaps giving some winter protection for their first year or two[K]. Any transplanting is best done in May or, preferably, in September. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It can take 18 months to germinate. Stored seed generally requires two winters and a summer before it will germinate and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. Scarification, followed by a warm stratification and then a cold stratification may speed up the germination time[78, 80]. The seedlings are rather slow-growing. Pot them up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame for their first year. It is possible to plant them out into a nursery bed in late spring of the following year, but they should not be left here for more than two years since they do not like being transplanted. Alternatively, grow them on in their pots for a second season and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them a good mulch and some protection for their first winter outdoors. This is a hybrid species so any seedlings will not be true to type. Cuttings of almost ripe wood with a heel, August in a shaded position in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months before potting up. Layering in October.
