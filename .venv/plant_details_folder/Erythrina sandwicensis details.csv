See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The flowers are used in the treatment of venereal diseases[436 ]. The pounded bark is used in the treatment of various genital diseases[436 ]. The bark is a medicine to be beaten with water and regularly drunk[436 ].,,"Design: Specimen Plant. Agroforestry Uses: With its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and its toleration of strong winds and drought, the tree is often used in revegetation programs of highly eroded areas in Hawaii[303 ]. It has been frequently planted as a live fence on account of readiness with which it takes root when planted in the ground[303 ]. Other Uses The tree (bark?) is a source of tannins. It is burned to make charcoal which can then be used as a colour pigment to blend with other ingredients in making paint[303 ]. The bright red seeds have been used for making leis[303 ]. The wood is light in weight[303 , 436 ]. It was used by ancient Hawaiians for fishing net buoys, surfboards and outriggers on canoes. More recently, the wood has been carved into imitation whale-tooth necklaces[303 ].","Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Agroforestry Services: Living trellis  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of lowland areas in Hawaii, where it id found below 610 metres in areas where the mean annual rainfall is in the range 500 - 1,250mm[303 ]. Grows best in an open, sunny position[303 ]. Prefers well-drained soils[303 ]. Survives extended drought and high winds, though can become wind-shaped in high exposure[303 , K ]. The various species of Erythrina can all, as far as is known, be intercrossed to produce fertile hybrids[310 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].","Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
