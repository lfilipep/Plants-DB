Plants are not very frost resistant , they can be damaged by temperatures below about -2°c and only succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[200]. A vigorous prostrate plant, rooting as it spreads. The flowers only open in the afternoon[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow March to June in a greenhouse. Lower night-time temperatures are beneficial. The seed usually germinates in 7 - 10 days at 23°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings at any time during the growing season. Allow the cutting to dry in the sun for a day or two then pot up in a very sandy mix. Very easy[K]."
