The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

Root - fibrous but pleasant to chew, containing starch and sugar[144, 177, 179]. Fairly sweet, the taste is sweetest in the wet season in Australia and worst from plants growing in sand[193]. The ash of the plant is used as a salt substitute[177].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Restorative: Restores consciousness or normal physiological activity.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.,Tonic: Improves general health.

The flowers are used in the treatment of haemorrhages, wounds etc[218]. They are decocted and used to treat urinary tract infections, fevers, thirst etc[147, 218]. The root is astringent, antifebrile, antivinous, diuretic, emollient, haemostatic, restorative and tonic[218, 240].

The inflorescences are valued for stuffing pillows and cushions[272]. The stems are used in thatching roofs[46, 61, 178, 272]. A fibre obtained from the leaves is used in making paper[46, 61, 154]. Can be planted on sandy soils to prevent erosion[154, 272]. The plants form impenetrably dense clumps and when planted close together in drifts make an excellent ground cover[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Border, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil in sun or partial shade[162, 187]. This species is only hardy in the southern part of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -15°c when dormant[187], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. The var. I. cylindrica major. (Nees.)C.E.Hubb. is used medicinally in China[176] and as a wild food in Australia[193]. This species is quite closely related to sugar cane, it has been interbred experimentally with that species in India[193]. Plants grow away vigorously after a fire, often spreading freely to infest the burnt areas[144, 193]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, There are no flowers or blooms.","Seed - surface sow in spring in a greenhouse. The seed germinates quickly, prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring as the plant comes into growth. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the year, though winter divisions are best potted up in the greenhouse and planted out in late spring[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
