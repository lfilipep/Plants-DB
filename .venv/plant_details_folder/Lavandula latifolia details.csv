See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",L. spica. L. pro parte. L. spica. DC. and many other authors.

Very aromatic[7], they cannot be eaten in quantity[K]. An essential oil from the flowers is used as a food flavouring[183].","Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Aromatherapy: Plants whose essential oils are used in Aromatherapy.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antibacterial  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Aromatherapy  Carminative  EmmenagogueSpike lavender has similar medicinal properties to common lavender (L. angustifolia). It yields more essential oil than that species but is of inferior quality[254]. The flowering stems, and the essential oil obtained from them, is abortifacient, antibacterial, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative and emmenagogue[46, 61, 254]. They can be used in all the ways that common lavender is used, externally to treat wounds, burns, insect stings etc and internally to treat digestive disorders[254]. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Immune system'[210].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Pot-pourri: Aromatic plants used to impart a pleasant smell to an area. Can this be grouped with incense or essential oil?,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","An essential oil is obtained from the flowers - used in soap making, perfumery, food flavouring, veterinary medicines, porcelain painting etc[46, 61]. This species yields up to three times the quantity of essential oil than is obtained from L. angustifolia, but the quality is inferior to that species[4, 11, 171]. When growing the plant for its essential oil content, it is best to harvest the flowering stems as soon as the flowers have faded[245]. The aromatic leaves and flowers are used as an insect repellent in the linen cupboard etc[46, 61]. They are also used in pot-pourri[245] and are said to repel mice[20]. The flowering stems, once the flowers have been removed for use in pot-pourri etc, can be tied in small bundles and burnt as incense sticks[245].",,"Succeeds in almost any soil so long as it is well-drained and not too acid[1, 200]. Prefers a sunny position in a neutral to alkaline soil[14, 200]. Prefers a light warm dry soil[37]. When grown in rich soils the plants tend to produce more leaves but less essential oils[4]. Very tolerant of salt wind exposure. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. When growing for maximum essential oil content, the plant must be given a very warm sunny position and will do best in a light sandy soil, the fragrance being especially pronounced in a chalky soil[245]. This species of lavender is cultivated for its essential oil in S. France and England[46, 61]. It is very closely related to L. angustifolia but perhaps not so hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[11, 200]. Plants are not very long-lived and soon become straggly unless pruned. Any trimming of the plant is best done in spring and should not be done in the autumn since this can encourage new growth that will not be very cold-hardy[200]. A good bee plant[7, 24], also attracting butterflies and moths[30]. A good companion for most plants[54], growing well with cabbages[14].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[4]. It usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Usually very east, a high percentage will root within a few weeks[78]. Grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings 7cm with a heel succeed at almost any time of the year[1].
