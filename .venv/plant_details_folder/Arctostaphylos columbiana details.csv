18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 177]. The fruit is best harvested when slightly under-ripe since the fully mature pulp is mealy[183]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentA decoction of the bark is used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257].,
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. The wood burns with a bright light and so was used at dances and ceremonials by the native North American Indians[257]. The wood is hard and is used for making tools and awl handles[257].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[11, 134, 200] but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[134]. This species is very closely related to A. tomentosa, but with a more northerly range[11].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first winter, Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. Takes one year[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200]. Layering in spring[200].",
