See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. tomentosa. non Pursh.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 177]. The fruit is best harvested when slightly under-ripe since the fully mature pulp is mealy[183]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentA decoction of the bark is used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257].,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. The wood burns with a bright light and so was used at dances and ceremonials by the native North American Indians[257]. The wood is hard and is used for making tools and awl handles[257].",,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade[11, 134, 200] but plants produce less fruit when they are grown in the shade[200]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[134]. This species is very closely related to A. tomentosa, but with a more northerly range[11].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first winter, Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. Takes one year[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200]. Layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
