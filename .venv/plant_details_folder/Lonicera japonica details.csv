0,Lonicera japonica,Japanese Honeysuckle,Caprifoliaceae,4-10,"The leaves contain saponins[179]. Saponins are quite toxic but are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. They can be found in many common foods such as some beans. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will normally remove most of the saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",Thickets in hills and mountains all over Japan[58].

The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Moths.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils.

The parboiled leaves are used as a vegetable[183]. Some caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity. Flowers - sucked for their sweet nectar[183], used as a vegetable or made into a syrup and puddings[183]. A tea is made from the leaves, buds and flowers[177, 183].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antiviral: Treats virus diseases,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Antiviral  Depurative  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Skin  TB  VDThe stems and flower buds are alterative, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, depurative, diuretic, febrifuge[147, 174, 176, 178, 238]. The plant is also used to reduce blood pressure[174, 176, 238]. The stems are used internally in the treatment of acute rheumatoid arthritis, mumps and hepatitis[238]. The stems are harvested in the autumn and winter, and are dried for later use[238]. The stems and flowers are used together as an infusion in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia) and dysentery[238]. An infusion of the flower buds is used in the treatment of a wide range of ailments including syphilitic skin diseases and tumours, bacterial dysentery, colds, enteritis, pain, swellings etc[174, 176, 218, 222, 238, 279]. Experimentally, the flower extracts have been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels and are antibacterial, antiviral and tuberculostatic[222, 279]. Externally, the flowers are applied as a wash to skin inflammations, infectious rashes and sores[238]. The flowers are harvested in early morning before they open and are dried for later use[238]. The plant has a similar action to Forsythia suspensa and is usually used in combination with that species to achieve a stronger action[176]. This plant has become a serious weed in many areas of N. America, it might have the potential to be utilized for proven medical purposes[222].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Insecticide: Kills insects.","A very vigorous climbing plant, it makes a good dense ground cover plant where it has the space to run over the ground but it will swamp smaller plants[197, 200]. The sub-species L. japonica repens is especially used for this purpose on the continent[182]. The cultivar 'Halliana' has also been recommended[188, 197]. This cultivar should be clipped back severely in the spring if it gets untidy, it responds well to such conditions[208]. Plants should be spaced about 1 metre apart each way[208]. The plant is said to be insecticidal[218]. The stems have been used in making baskets[257].",,"Prefers a good moist soil with its roots in the shade and its top climbing into the light[200]. Succeeds in any soil in part shade[184]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. They succeed in dry shade, the cultivar 'Halliana' is especially recommended for such a situation[188]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. The foliage can be damaged in severe wind-chill conditions but the plant usually recovers in the spring[202]. Fruit is only formed after a hot summer[202]. A rampantly growing plant[190], it climbs by twining around other plants[182] and makes an excellent screen for a north or east facing fence or an unsightly object[190]. This species has the potential to become a rampant weed, it has escaped from cultivation in N. America whre it can outcompete native species[274]. The plant has powerfully scented flowers. The white-flowered cultivar 'Halliana' has a pronounced lemon-like perfume[245]. There are several named varieties, developed for their ornamental value[182, 200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78].
