24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a cool moist shady position and a light sandy soil[1, 42, 111]. Likes plenty of humus in the soil[111]. Grows well in a woodland garden and in the rock garden[200]. Plants grow much taller in rich soils and then succeed in the herbaceous border[222]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[187]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the summer[200]. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division after the plants die down in late summer. It is best carried out in early spring before the plants flower[188]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring."
