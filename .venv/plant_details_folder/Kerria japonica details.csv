They sucker freely and can be invasive[202]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

Sow stored seed as soon as possible in a cold frame, it is likely to require a period of cold stratification. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of suckers, removed with care from established plants during the dormant season[200]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Cuttings of young shoots. Young basal shoots in early summer work quite well. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.
