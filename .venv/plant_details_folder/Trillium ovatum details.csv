See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Leaves: ,,The leaves are sometimes cooked for greens[212].,"Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Birthing aid  Ophthalmic  SkinA decoction of the fresh or dried powdered root is used as a treatment for sore eyes[207]. The fresh root juice can be dripped into an afflicted eye[257]. The juice of the plant can be applied externally as a treatment for boils[257]. A poultice of the root can be used as a treatment for boils[257]. The thick underground root stalks were used by some native North American Indian tribes during childbirth[212].,,None known,,"Prefers a deep well-drained woodland or humus-rich soil in a somewhat shady position that remains moist in the summer[1, 42]. Prefers a neutral to slightly acid soil[200]. Grows well in open woodland[1]. Succeeds in deep shade[188]. Succeeds in a sunny position if the soil does not dry out[42]. Any transplanting is best done whilst the plants are in flower[200]. Plants can flower in two years from seed[138]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233], though slugs are very fond of the leaves[238].","Seed - best sown in a shaded cold frame as soon as it is ripe[134, 200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring. Seed usually germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c. Another report says that seeds produce a root after the first cold stratification but no shoot is produced until after a second winter[138], whilst yet another report says that the seed can take 3 years to germinate[238]. The seedlings are prone to damp off and must therefore be watered with care and given plenty of fresh air[138]. The young plants need to be overwintered in a cold frame for the first year and can then be planted out in late spring. It is very important that the pots become neither too dry nor too wet[138]. Division with care when the plants die down after flowering[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
