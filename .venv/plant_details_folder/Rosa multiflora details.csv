13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rosa multiflora is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft 5in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or made into preserves, pies etc[105, 177, 183]. The fruit is about 7mm in diameter[200], but there is only a thin layer of flesh surrounding the many seeds[K]. The fruit is rich in carotene (81.4mg per 100g) and vitamin C[218]. Some care has to be taken when eating this fruit, see the notes above on known hazards. Young leaves and shoots - raw or cooked[105, 177, 183]. Used as they emerge from the ground in spring. The young leaves contain more than 200mg per 100g of vitamin C[218]. The seed is a good source of vitamin E, it can be ground and mixed with flour or added to other foods as a supplement[102, 183]. Be sure to remove the seed hairs[102]. The seed contains about 8% oil[218].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antidote  Astringent  Cancer  Carminative  Diuretic  Hypoglycaemic  Laxative  Poultice  Vitamin CThe leaves are poulticed and applied to sores[218]. The fruit is anodyne, diuretic, hypoglycaemic and laxative[218]. It is also antidotal to fish poisoning[218]. It is used to treat constipation and articular pain[279] and as an application to foul ulcers, wounds, sprains and injuries[240]. The seed is laxative and diuretic[218]. The root is rich in tannins. It is astringent and carminative[218]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is fairly wind tolerant and can be grown as a shelter hedge though it can be damaged by salt laden winds[75]. The plant has a dense sturdy habit and makes an excellent hedge[245]. The root contains 23-25 per cent of tannin[266]. An essential oil obtained from the fresh flowers is used in the cosmetic industry[266]. The plant also has an extensive root system and is used for soil stabilization[11, 200]. This species can also be used as a rootstock for other species of rose, especially for ramblers and when grown on poor soils[11, 200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[11], preferring a circumneutral soil and a sunny position[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds on poor soils[200]. Dislikes water-logged soils[200]. Grows well with alliums, parsley, mignonette and lupins[18, 20]. Garlic planted nearby can help protect the plant from disease and insect predation[18, 20]. Grows badly with boxwood[18]. A very ornamental plant[1], more than 100 blooms can be produced in a single cluster[245]. These flowers possess a delicious sweet fruity perfume[245]. Plants often self-layer[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[80]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat[80]. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate[80]. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested[80]. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°c[200]. It may take 2 years to germinate[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July in a shaded frame. Overwinter the plants in the frame and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth. Select pencil thick shoots in early autumn that are about 20 - 25cm long and plant them in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[78, 200]. The cuttings can take 12 months to establish but a high percentage of them normally succeed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Layering. Takes 12 months[11].",
