At the limit of its climatic range in Britain and probably best grown in a cold water aquarium[200]. It over-winters in temperate areas by means of resting buds which sink to the bottom of the pond in the late autumn and rise again in the spring[200]. One of the smallest flowering plants in the world, it is cultivated as a vegetable in Burma, Laos and Thailand[183]. It has been recommended for commercial cultivation, especially in tropical areas, because of its rapid multiplication and high nutritional value[183]. Plant densities of over two million plants per square metre have been found[274].",
