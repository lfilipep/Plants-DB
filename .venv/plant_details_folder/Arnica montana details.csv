Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiecchymotic  Antiphlogistic  Antirheumatic  Epilepsy  Nervine  Sternutatory  VulneraryArnica has a long history of herbal use, especially as an external treatment for bruises and sprains[232, 238] - it is an ingredient of a number of proprietary preparations[238]. Internally, it has been used in the treatment of heart complaints and as a booster for the immune system[238]. Arnica increases local blood supply and accelerates healing, it is anti-inflammatory and increases the rate of absorption of internal bleeding[254]. Generally the plant is nowadays only recommended for internal use as a homeopathic medicine, principally for treating shock, injury and pain[254]. If used as a decoction or tincture it stimulates the circulation and is valuable in the treatment of angina and a weak or failing heart, but it can be toxic even at quite low doses and so is rarely used this way[254]. The flowers are the part most commonly used[4, 232], they are harvested when fully open and dried - the receptacles are sometimes removed since these are liable to be attacked by insects[4]. The root is also used, it is harvested after the leaves have died down in the autumn and dried for later use[4]. The whole plant is antiecchymotic, antiphlogistic, nervine, sternutatory, vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 46, 165]. Although a very valuable remedy, it should be used with caution. It has been known to cause contact dermatitis when used externally and collapse when taken internally[238]. Only take it internally under the supervision of a qualified practitioner. The freshly crushed flowers cause sneezing if inhaled[232]. The leaves have also been smoked as a tobacco[232], though it is unclear whether this was for medicinal reasons The whole plant, harvested when in flower, is used in homeopathic remedies[232]. It is especially useful in the treatment of traumatic injuries, sores and bruises[232]. The homeopathic dose has also been used effectively in the treatment of epilepsy and seasickness, and it might be of use as a hair growth stimulant[268]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Arnica montana for fever and colds, inflammation of the skin, cough/bronchitis, inflammation of the mouth and pharynx, rheumatism, common cold, blunt injuries, tendency to infection (see [302] for critics of commission E).

One report says that it is often found in calcareous soils in the wild[7]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.8 to 7.6. Prefers a mixture of sand, loam and peat[1]. Prefers a position in full sun[1, 134]. Succeeds in light woodland[14] and in a rock garden or border[1, 14]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. This species is declining in the wild, probably because of over-collection as a medicinal herb. It may become extinct in part of its range[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in pots outdoors. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame[4]. A period of cold stratification is helpful[238]. The fresh seed can germinate in 3 - 4 weeks at 13°c according to one report[134], though it can be slow, difficult and erratic and take 2 years to germinate[268]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the following spring.
