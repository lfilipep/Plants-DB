Requires a light or medium well-drained soil and a sunny position[11, 200]. Succeeds on chalk[11]. Most members of this genus have their top-growth cut back by winter cold in this country. The roots are much hardier, however, and the plants usually resprout freely from the base in late spring, growing away quickly and flowering freely in late summer[K]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow February in a warm greenhouse. The germination can be variable.

Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel if possible, July/August in individual pots in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in late spring or early summer[11]. Root cuttings 3cm long in December. Good percentage[78]. Suckers.
