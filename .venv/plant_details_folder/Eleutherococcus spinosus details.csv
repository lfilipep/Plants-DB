Tolerates urban pollution and poor soils[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c if they are sheltered from cold winds[200]. Considered to be a part of E. sieboldianus by some botanists, but this species has smaller leaves[200]. It is closely related to and often confused with E. divaricatus[200]. There is a spineless form of this species, known as Eleutherococcus spinosus inermis (Makino) H. Ohashi[275]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. It can be slow to germinate. Stored seed requires 6 months warm followed by 3 months cold stratification[113] and can be very slow to germinate[133]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113, 200]. Cuttings of ripe wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 30cm long in a cold frame[238]. Root cuttings in late winter[200]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[200]."
