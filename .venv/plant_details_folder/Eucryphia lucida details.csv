17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires an open but sheltered position and a light moist lime-free soil[11, 184]. Succeeds in any free open loamy soil[1]. Prefers its base in the shade with its canopy in the light[200]. Requires plenty of light if it is to flower freely, tolerating almost full sun if the soil is cool and moist[11]. Strongly resents dryness at the roots during the growing season[125]. Requires a sheltered position when grown in the colder areas of the country[200]. This species is hardy to about -10°c[184], succeeding outdoors in the milder areas of Britain south and west of London[11]. The leaves and young shoots are very resinous[11]. The honey-like perfume of the flowers pervades the air for some considerable distance[245]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200]. A good bee plant[156, 166]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[184]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February in a greenhouse. The seed should be stored cool and dry over the winter. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a heel, June/July in individual pots in a frame. Roots in 5 - 6 weeks. A variable percentage succeed[78]. Layering in late summer. Takes 16 months. High percentage[78]."
