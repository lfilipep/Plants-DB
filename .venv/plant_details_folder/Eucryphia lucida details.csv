See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",E. billardieri.

Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

Succeeds in any free open loamy soil[1]. Prefers its base in the shade with its canopy in the light[200]. Requires plenty of light if it is to flower freely, tolerating almost full sun if the soil is cool and moist[11]. Strongly resents dryness at the roots during the growing season[125]. Requires a sheltered position when grown in the colder areas of the country[200]. This species is hardy to about -10°c[184], succeeding outdoors in the milder areas of Britain south and west of London[11]. The leaves and young shoots are very resinous[11]. The honey-like perfume of the flowers pervades the air for some considerable distance[245]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200]. A good bee plant[156, 166]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[184].","Seed - sow February in a greenhouse. The seed should be stored cool and dry over the winter. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a heel, June/July in individual pots in a frame. Roots in 5 - 6 weeks. A variable percentage succeed[78]. Layering in late summer. Takes 16 months. High percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
