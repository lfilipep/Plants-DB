It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw. A mealy pleasant acid taste[149]. The fruit is up to 8mm in diameter[227], though most of this is the large seed[K]. The N. American Indians ground the fruit and ate it with parched corn or fat[227]. This means that they probably also ate the seed[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Succeeds on dry gravels and on sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Trees prefer hotter summers and more sunlight than are normally experienced in Britain, they often do not fully ripen their wood when growing in this country and they are then very subject to die-back in winter[1, 11, 200]. Trees can be very long-lived, perhaps to 1000 years[200]. A good bee plant[149]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed is best given 2 - 3 months cold stratification and then sown February/March in a greenhouse[78, 200]. Germination rates are usually good, though the stored seed might take 12 months or more to germinate. The seed can be stored for up to 5 years[113]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The leaves of seedlings often have a lot of white patches without chlorophyll, this is normal and older plants produce normal green leaves. Grow the seedlings on in a cold frame for their first winter, and plant them out in the following late spring or early summer[K]. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
