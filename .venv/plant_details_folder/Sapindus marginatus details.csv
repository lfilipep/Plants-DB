24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy outdoors in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors at least in the mildest areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun[220]. This species tolerates a wide range of soils, including those that are dry, stony and nutrient deficient[200]. Trees are relatively slow-growing in the wild[229].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires some cold stratification. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in a cold frame in mid-winter. Move to a greenhouse in early spring. The seed should germinate in late spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fairly good percentage[78].",
