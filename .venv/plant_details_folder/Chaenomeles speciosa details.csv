The fruit is cooked. It is very harsh and acid raw but fragrant when cooked. Used for jams, jellies etc. and as a flavouring with cooked apples. The fruit can be apple or pear-shaped and up to 6.5cm long x 6.5cm wide. The fruit is improved by a cold spell becoming softer. Flowering quince juice contains 150 mg of vitamin C,  more than lemons.

It is in flower from February to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",C. laganaria. Cydonia lagenaria. Cydonia speciosa.

Some cultivars, such as 'Jet Trail' are suitable for ground cover[182].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Espalier, Hedge, Massing, Woodland garden . Easily cultivated in any reasonably good soil[1, 11]. Prefers a deep moist well-drained loam[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates full shade but requires a sunny position for best fruit production[3, 11, 200]. Becomes chlorotic on very alkaline soils[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. This species is hardy to about -25°c[200]. Plants fruit freely in Britain, but the fruit does not always ripen. They do best when grown against a south-facing wall[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties developed for their ornamental value[182, 183]. Closely allied to C. japonica[11]. A good bee plant, flowering early in the year and providing pollen and nectar[108]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in February in a greenhouse[78]. Germination usually takes place within 6 weeks[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If well grown, these seedling can be large enough to plant out in the summer, but give them some protection in their first winter. Otherwise plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Easy[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a cold frame. Layering in late spring or in autumn. This is a sure and easy method, though it takes 12 months[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
