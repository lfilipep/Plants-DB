13,Summary,"Darmera peltata nana is a dwarf version of Indian rhubarb growing in USDA hardiness zones 5-7 and 12-28"" (0.3m) high. Growth is slow to medium. Bloom Color: Pink, White.Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Late spring. Form: Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Darmera peltata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from May to October, in flower in April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  wet soil and can grow in water."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents."
23,Other Uses Description,"Can be grown as a ground cover plant in a sunny position[188]. Plants should be spaced about 60cm apart each way[208]. Useful as a soil stabilizer for marshy land or muddy banks[200, 233]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Specimen. Succeeds in sun or shade[31] in a wet soil or shallow water[60]. Although quite cold-hardy when dormant, the young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. There is at least one named form. 'Nana' is a dwarf form, growing only 30cm tall and so is more suited for the small garden[200]. It also makes a good ground cover[208]. The plant comes into flower before the leaves appear[188]. Individual leaves are up to 30cm across[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Wetlands plant, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe or in early spring in a cold frame[188]. Keep the soil very moist. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[31]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
