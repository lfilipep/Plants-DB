0,Cyathodes colensoi,,Epacridaceae,7-10,None known,Montane to lower sub-alpine open grassland to rocky places and fellfield on North and South Islands[44].,New Zealand.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Cyathodes colensoi is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Leucopogon colensoi.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A sweet mealy flesh[153]. Rarely seen on plants growing in Britain[11]. The fruit is about 5mm in diameter[200]. One report says that the fruit contains up to 24% by dry weight of oil[153], does this refer to the seed?[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,A most attractive ground cover plant for the winter garden[182].,,"Requires a moist well-drained lime-free humus rich soil in a sheltered site in partial or dappled shade[11, 164, 200]. Plants are very susceptible to drought[200]. A good rock garden plant. Slow growing[11]. This species is fairly hardy in Britain but it can be damaged in very severe winters[11]. Another report says that it is only hardy to about -5°c[200], but plants have been seen growing on a very shady north-facing slope in a rock garden at Kew, which experiences lower temperatures than this[K]. These plants were undamaged after the very cold winter of 1996 - 97 and were flowering freely in April 1997[K]. Plants grow best in areas with moderate winters and cool moist summers[200]. The sweetly scented flowers are produced in axillary clusters[245]. Plants have very fine root systems and great care must be taken when transplanting them[157].","Seed - surface sow in ericaceous soil, February/March in a cold frame[164]. Do not exclude light[164]. Germination can take place within 1 - 2 months at 18°c but often takes 3 - 5 years[200]. Scarification will reduce the germination time and 2 or 3 periods of 4 - 6 weeks cold stratification alternated with 4 weeks warm stratification can also help[175]. Perhaps sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe would also be beneficial[K].The seedlings can be very slow to form roots and need to be potted up with great care[200]. Grow them on in a greenhouse for at least two years before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[188]. Neither easy nor reliable[200].
