18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A sweet mealy flesh[153]. Rarely seen on plants growing in Britain[11]. The fruit is about 5mm in diameter[200]. One report says that the fruit contains up to 24% by dry weight of oil[153], does this refer to the seed?[K]."

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,A most attractive ground cover plant for the winter garden[182].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist well-drained lime-free humus rich soil in a sheltered site in partial or dappled shade[11, 164, 200]. Plants are very susceptible to drought[200]. A good rock garden plant. Slow growing[11]. This species is fairly hardy in Britain but it can be damaged in very severe winters[11]. Another report says that it is only hardy to about -5°c[200], but plants have been seen growing on a very shady north-facing slope in a rock garden at Kew, which experiences lower temperatures than this[K]. These plants were undamaged after the very cold winter of 1996 - 97 and were flowering freely in April 1997[K]. Plants grow best in areas with moderate winters and cool moist summers[200]. The sweetly scented flowers are produced in axillary clusters[245]. Plants have very fine root systems and great care must be taken when transplanting them[157]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in ericaceous soil, February/March in a cold frame[164]. Do not exclude light[164]. Germination can take place within 1 - 2 months at 18°c but often takes 3 - 5 years[200]. Scarification will reduce the germination time and 2 or 3 periods of 4 - 6 weeks cold stratification alternated with 4 weeks warm stratification can also help[175]. Perhaps sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe would also be beneficial[K].The seedlings can be very slow to form roots and need to be potted up with great care[200]. Grow them on in a greenhouse for at least two years before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[188]. Neither easy nor reliable[200]. Air layering[200]."
