Prefers a neutral to acid soil but tolerates some chalk[200]. Succeeds in dry shade[188]. Dislikes an unduly exposed position but tolerates more wind than other members of this genus[200]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], its fruits are produced freely in British gardens[K]. The flowers are fragrant[184].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed probably germinates best if it is given 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification before sowing[113]. The seed usually takes 6 - 18 months to germinate, it should be pricked out into individual pots when it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in the greenhouse and plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood taken at the end of July, in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. A good percentage. Plant out in the spring 18 months later[78]. Layering in spring[200] or autumn[78]. Partially sever the layer leads in the following late summer and plant out in the autumn. High percentage[78].",
