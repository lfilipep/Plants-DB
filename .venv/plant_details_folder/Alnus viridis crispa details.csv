21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Appetizer  Astringent  Emetic  Emmenagogue  Haemostatic  Poultice  Skin  Stomachic  TonicThe bark is astringent, emetic, haemostatic, stomachic and tonic[172]. The bark was burnt as an inhalant in the treatment of rheumatism[257]. The ashes were also used as a tooth cleaner[257]. A decoction of the inner bark has been used as a carminative to reduce gas in the stomach and as a febrifuge[257]. A decoction of the plant has been used in a steam treatment to bring about menstruation - it has been used as an abortifacient[257]. A poultice of the leaves has been used to treat infected wounds or sores[257]. The poultice was left in place over the wound until the leaves stuck to it and was then pulled off, removing the 'poison' with it[257]. An infusion of the plant tops was given to children with poor appetites[257]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a heavy soil and a damp situation[1, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A useful plant for cold damp places[11]. Tolerates lime and very infertile sites[11, 200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe and only just covered[200]. Spring sown seed should also germinate successfully so long as it is not covered[200, K]. The seed should germinate in the spring as the weather warms up. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. If growth is sufficient, it is possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in pots outdoors and plant them out in the spring. If you have sufficient quantity of seed, it can be sown thinly in an outdoor seed bed in the spring[78]. The seedlings can either be planted out into their permanent positions in the autumn/winter, or they can be allowed to grow on in the seed bed for a further season before planting them. Cuttings of mature wood, taken as soon as the leaves fall in autumn, outdoors in sandy soil."
