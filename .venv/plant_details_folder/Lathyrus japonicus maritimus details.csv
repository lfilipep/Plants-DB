24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good garden soil[1]. Prefers a deep moist well-drained soil in a cool position[187]. Prefers a position in full sun, growing well on hot sunny banks[200]. The seed remains viable for 4 - 5 years in sea water[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is herbaceous. The plant growth habit is a suckering vine sending up suckers some distance main plant [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200]. Division in spring. It may not transplant well so care should be taken[200].",
