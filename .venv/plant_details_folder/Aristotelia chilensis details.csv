It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil.

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a slightly acid, moderately fertile well-drained soil in full sun with shelter from cold drying winds[200]. Plants are fairly tolerant of maritime exposure[K]. This species is only hardy in the milder and moister areas of Britain[182] and even there can be cut back in severe winters[K]. If the plants are cut back by winter frosts, they normally put up a crowd of vigorous shoots in the spring and these will need thinning[219]. The fruits are freely produced in S.W. England[11]. There is a very good plant at Rosehill near Falmouth[59]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[59]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[182].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are at least 20cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth in early winter[1]. Take cuttings 15 - 30cm long and plant them in pots or the open soil in a greenhouse. They normally root very easily and can be potted up in early summer then planted out late the following spring[K].",
