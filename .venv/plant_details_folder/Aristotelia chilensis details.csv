America - Chile, Argentina.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AristoteliaChilensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Aristotelia chilensis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 5 m (16ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. macqui. Cornus chilensis,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or dried for winter use[11, 22, 46, 61, 97]. A pleasant taste somewhat like bilberries[2]. The fruit is rather small, about 6mm in diameter[200].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Febrifuge  PoulticeA wine made from the fruit is said to have medicinal properties[11]. The plant (the exact part is not specified) is astringent, febrifuge and poultice. It is used in the treatment of throat infections and intestinal tumours[139].",,None known,,"Prefers a slightly acid, moderately fertile well-drained soil in full sun with shelter from cold drying winds[200]. Plants are fairly tolerant of maritime exposure[K]. This species is only hardy in the milder and moister areas of Britain[182] and even there can be cut back in severe winters[K]. If the plants are cut back by winter frosts, they normally put up a crowd of vigorous shoots in the spring and these will need thinning[219]. The fruits are freely produced in S.W. England[11]. There is a very good plant at Rosehill near Falmouth[59]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[59]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[182].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are at least 20cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth in early winter[1]. Take cuttings 15 - 30cm long and plant them in pots or the open soil in a greenhouse. They normally root very easily and can be potted up in early summer then planted out late the following spring[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
