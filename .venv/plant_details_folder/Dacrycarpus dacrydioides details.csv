24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires sheltered moist woodland conditions[166]. Plants are not very frost-tolerant and are only hardy outdoors in the mildest areas of Britain[1, 81]. In their native habitat trees can reach 45 metres in height, but they are slow growing in Britain and rarely exceed 6 metres[11, 185].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking 18 months or more. It is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Cuttings of short leading shoots, late summer in a frame[1]. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts. It side shoots are used as cuttings they will form prostrate plants[200].",
