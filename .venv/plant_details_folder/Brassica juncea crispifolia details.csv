0,Brassica juncea crispifolia,Curled Mustard,Brassicaceae or Cruciferae,6-9,None known,Not known in the wild.,A cultivar of garden origin.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Brassica juncea crispifolia is a ANNUAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ","Oil: Oil,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Oil: ","eaves - raw or cooked[22, 33, 46, 52, 61]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[206]. The leaves can also be finely shredded and added to mixed salads[206]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[183]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[52]. Sweet and succulent[133]. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[1, 2, 17, 57, 183]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[74]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[171]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[183], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[238]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[238]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[238]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[238]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads.","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Aperient  Diuretic  Emetic  Galactogogue  Rubefacient  StimulantReported to be anodyne, aperitif, diuretic, emetic, rubefacient, and stimulant, the plant is a folk remedy for arthritis, foot ache, lumbago, and rheumatism[269]. The seed is used in the treatment of tumours in China[269]. In Korea, the seeds are used in the treatment of abscesses, colds, lumbago, rheumatism, and stomach disorders[269]. The root is used as a galactagogue in Africa[269]. Ingestion may impart a body odour repellent to mosquitoes[269]. Mustard oil is used in the treatment of skin eruptions and ulcers[269]. Believed to be aperient and tonic, the volatile oil is used as a counterirritant and stimulant[269]. In Java the plant is used as an antisyphilitic emmenagogue[269]. Leaves applied to the forehead are said to relieve headache[269]. The Chinese eat the leaves in soups for bladder, inflammation or haemorrhage[269].","Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",There is some evidence that if this plant is grown as a green manure it is effective in reducing soil-borne root rots in pea crops[206]. This is attributed to chemicals that are given off as the plants decay[206].,,"Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[16, 200, 206]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[16]. Dislikes very hot weather[33]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[206]. A form of B. juncea with curled leaves that has been selected in the Orient for its edibility. There are some named varieties[206]. Plants in this group are fairly cold-tolerant and often stand the winter, they are then slow to bolt and can supply a good crop of leaves in the spring[206]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[269]. A good bee plant[74].","Seed - sow in situ from August to October. Spring and early summer-sown crops tend to run quickly to seed, though they can be eaten whilst still small[206]. It is best not to sow the seed in very hot weather[206]. There are about 5,660 - 6,000 per 0.01 kg (1/3 oz)[269].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
