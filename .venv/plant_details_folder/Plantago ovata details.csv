Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",P. decumbens. P. ispaghula.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Stabilizer: this is often a gum and could perhaps be included there.,"Young leaves - raw or cooked. The mucilage contained in the seedcoat is used as a stabilizer in ice cream, chocolate etc[105, 177, 183]. Seed - sprouted and eaten in salads[183].","Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticholesterolemic  Antidiarrhoeal  Demulcent  Dysentery  Laxative  UrinaryPsyllium has been used as a safe and effective laxative for thousands of years in Western herbal medicine[254]. Both the dried seeds and the seed husks are demulcent, emollient and laxative[4, 9, 46, 254]. They are used in the treatment of dysentery, catarrhal conditions of the genito-urinary tract, inflamed membranes of the intestinal canal etc[4, 46, 165, 171]. The seeds have a mucilaginous coat and swell to several times their volume when in water[9]. The seeds and the husks contain high levels of fibre, they expand and become highly gelatinous when soaked in water. By maintaining a high water content within the large bowel they increase the bulk of the stool, easing its passage[254]. They are used as a demulcent and as a bulk laxative in the treatment of constipation, dysentery and other intestinal complaints, having a soothing and regulatory effect upon the system[4, 9]. Their regulatory effect on the digestive system means that they can also be used in the treatment of diarrhoea and by helping to soften the stool they reduce the irritation of haemorrhoids[254]. The jelly-like mucilage produced when psyllium is soaked in water has the ability to absorb toxins within the large bowel. Thus it helps to remove toxins from the body and can be used to reduce auto-toxicity[254]. The oil in the seed embryo contains 50% linoleic acid and has been used as a preventative of atherosclerosis[240]. It is also effective in reducing cholesterol levels in the blood[240].",Starch: Used as a fabric stiffener.,A mucilage found in the seed coat is sometimes used as a starch to stiffen linen[4].,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native habitat it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. This plant is cultivated for its seed in India[46, 61]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. A sowing can be made outdoors in situ in mid to late spring if you have enough seeds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
