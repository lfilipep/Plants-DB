However, it is hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be applied directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder, wetter winters[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in shallow water or a bog garden[200]. Possibly requires saline conditions[K]. 193","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. Stand the pots in about 2cm of water. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
