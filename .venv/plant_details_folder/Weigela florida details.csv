Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Softwood basal cuttings, 10 - 12cm long, in a sandy soil in a cold frame in early summer[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 8 - 10 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
