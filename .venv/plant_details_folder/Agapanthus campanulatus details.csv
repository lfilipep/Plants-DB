14,Physical Characteristics,"Agapanthus campanulatus is an evergreen Bulb growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[175] but it prefers a light very well-drained porous soil with plenty of leaf-mould[200]. Requires plenty of moisture during the growing season but it needs to be kept dry in the winter[1, 200]. Another report says that it is drought resistant when established[190]. It only flowers freely when growing in a very sunny position[175]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. The rhizomes are best planted only just below soil level - a mulch of gravel or stone chips will help to keep the crown of the plant free from excess moisture[282]. Plants are probably hardy to about -15°c[187], but are best if given a good mulch should temperatures lower than -5°c occur[200]. Some plants growing in Essex have their leaves killed by the first frosts of the autumn but the clumps are unharmed[190]. Hybridizes very freely with other members of this genus - some botanists say there is only one very variable species of Agapanthus[200]. A number of named varieties have been selected for their ornamental value[187]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The flowering stems lean towards the sun[175]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe[200], it can also be sown in a greenhouse in March/April[133]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 18°c[133], do not sow it too thickly so that it is possible to grow the seedlings on in their pot without disturbing them for their first year of growth. Give occasional liquid feeds to make sure they do not become nutrient deficient. Divide the seedlings up into individual pots in the spring following germination, grow them on for a further year in the greenhouse and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Seedlings take 2 - 3 years to flower[133]. Division of offsets in April/May. Do not move plants between October and March[175]. Division is very easy in the growing season, the divisions can be planed straight out into their permanent positions if required."
