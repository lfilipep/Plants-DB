Plants produce bulbils in their leaf axils and when growing in suitable conditions can become invasive[188, 238]. The plants can be naturalized in woodland[1].","Seed - we have no information but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of offsets as new growth begins in spring[238]. Bulbils from the leaf axils can be potted up in late summer and be planted out in late spring[238].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
