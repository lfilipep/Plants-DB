It is also an ingredient of a Chinese prescription for removing gallstones without surgery, a process that usually causes severe nausea[238]. The root is also used internally in the treatment of coughs with thin watery phlegm and gastritis[238]. The fresh root is extremely acrid and contains toxins, these are neutralized upon drying or by soaking in tea or vinegar[238]. The root is harvested in the summer and dried for later use, it should not be used fresh[174, 238].

25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown when given a rich soil, it requires plenty of water in the growing season[1]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. This species is cultivated as a medicinal plant in China[178]. Plants produce bulbils in their leaf axils and when growing in suitable conditions can become invasive[188, 238]. The plants can be naturalized in woodland[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of offsets as new growth begins in spring[238]. Bulbils from the leaf axils can be potted up in late summer and be planted out in late spring[238]."
