0,Picea omorika,Serbian Spruce,Pinaceae,4-7,None known,Plants are confined to a few stands on limestone mountains[11].,Europe - Serbia.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PiceaOmorika.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PiceaOmorika2.jpg",Form: Pyramidal.,"Picea omorika is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Bog Garden;,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ","Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","catkins - raw or cooked. Used as a flavouring[172]. Immature female cones - cooked. The central portion, when roasted, is sweet and syrupy[172]. Inner bark - dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereals when making bread[172]. An emergency food, it is only used when all else fails. Seed - raw. Too small and fiddly to be worthwhile unless you are desperate[172]. A refreshing tea, rich in vitamin C, can be made from the young shoot tips[172].",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is valued for its use in the pulp industry to make paper[171].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Likes abundant moisture at the roots, if grown in drier areas it must be given a deep moist soil[11]. Tolerates poor peaty soils[200]. Succeeds in wet cold and shallow soils but is not very wind-firm in shallow soils[1]. Prefers a pH between 4 to 6 but it also succeeds in pure chalk soils[200]. Dislikes shade[200]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[11]. Resists wind exposure to some degree[200]. In some upland areas, especially over granitic or other base-poor soils, growth rate and health have been seriously affected by aluminium poisoning induced by acid rain[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. There are a number of named forms selected for their ornamental value, most of these are dwarf cultivars[200]. A fast growing tree from its second year of growth. Two to three years after planting out new shoots 1 metre long may be produced[185]. Growth takes place from mid-May to the end of July. Height increase is moderate over a long term basis, averaging around 50cm a year[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Occasionally planted as a timber tree in Britain, it produces almost the same bulk of timber as the Norway spruce (Picea abies) but is more frost tolerant and can be grown in frosty hollows[185] because it comes into leaf quite late and it is not damaged by late frosts[11]. This species is widely cultivated as a timber tree in regions too dry or liable to late frosts for P. sitchensis to do well[200]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - stratification will probably improve germination so sow fresh seed in the autumn in a cold frame if possible[80]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[78]. A position in light shade is probably best[78]. Seed should not be allowed to dry out and should be stored in a cool place[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, or be placed in an outdoor nursery bed for a year or so to increase in size. They might need protection from spring frosts. Cuttings of semi-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 8cm long, August in a frame. Protect from frost. Forms roots in the spring[78]. Cuttings of mature terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, September/October in a cold frame. Takes 12 months[78]. Cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, early summer in a frame.
