21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Analgesic  Diaphoretic  Ophthalmic  Sialagogue  StimulantAnalgesic[46, 61]. The bark, especially of the roots[82] is the part most commonly used medicinally, though other parts of the plant, including the fruit[82], also possess medicinal properties[4]. The fresh bark is strongly emetic, ophthalmic, purgative and sialagogue[4, 46, 61, 222, 257], when dried it is a stimulating alterative and is diaphoretic[82]. A tincture of the berries is used in the treatment of toothache and rheumatism[4, 222, 257]. A poultice of the roots is applied to boils, skin eruptions, varicose veins, old sores and swellings[222, 257]. A cold infusion of the roots is used as drops for sore eyes[257].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a good deep loam and a semi-shady position[1]. Requires a sheltered position[1]. A fast-growing but short-lived tree in its native zone[229], this species is of little value in Britain[1]. It is generally a single-stemmed plant, often spreading freely by means of suckers[182, 229]. Plants make finer foliage when growing in rich soils but are generally healthier and longer-lived in a comparatively poor soil[11]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 4 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are 25cm or more tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, late spring or early summer being the best time to do this. Root cuttings 8cm long, December in a cold frame[11, 78]. Store the roots upside down in sand and pot up in March/April. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in late winter[11]. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
