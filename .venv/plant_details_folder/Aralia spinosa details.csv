It is in flower from August to September, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,Leaves: ,,"Young leaves - cooked[105, 177]. The leaves usually have a number of slender prickles, they must be gathered before the prickles harden[159] and are then chopped finely and used as a potherb[183].","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Analgesic  Diaphoretic  Ophthalmic  Sialagogue  StimulantAnalgesic[46, 61]. The bark, especially of the roots[82] is the part most commonly used medicinally, though other parts of the plant, including the fruit[82], also possess medicinal properties[4]. The fresh bark is strongly emetic, ophthalmic, purgative and sialagogue[4, 46, 61, 222, 257], when dried it is a stimulating alterative and is diaphoretic[82]. A tincture of the berries is used in the treatment of toothache and rheumatism[4, 222, 257]. A poultice of the roots is applied to boils, skin eruptions, varicose veins, old sores and swellings[222, 257]. A cold infusion of the roots is used as drops for sore eyes[257].",Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,"- close-grained, weak, light, soft, brittle[82, 227].

A fast-growing but short-lived tree in its native zone[229], this species is of little value in Britain[1]. It is generally a single-stemmed plant, often spreading freely by means of suckers[182, 229]. Plants make finer foliage when growing in rich soils but are generally healthier and longer-lived in a comparatively poor soil[11]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K].

Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 4 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are 25cm or more tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, late spring or early summer being the best time to do this. Root cuttings 8cm long, December in a cold frame[11, 78]. Store the roots upside down in sand and pot up in March/April. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in late winter[11]. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
