Prefers a position sheltered from hot or cold drying winds[200]. Only succeeds outdoors in the mild areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. Grows well in coastal areas so long as it is not too exposed[188]. Resents root disturbance[200]. Plants do not regenerate from old wood[200]. Closely related to L. lanigerum[11]. A good bee plant[108]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. The seed remains viable for many years. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, early August in a frame. Over-winter in the greenhouse for its first year. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 4 - 5 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. Good percentage[78]."
