Prefers a position sheltered from hot or cold drying winds[200]. Another report says that it tolerates fairly exposed positions and that has been our experience with it[K]. Hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens, where it succeeds in sun or shade, it only succeeds outdoors in mild areas of Britain, requiring the protection of a wall in colder parts. Plants are hardy to about -15°c in Britain[184]. Polymorphic[157]. There are two distinct forms grown in Britain, one with smallish greyish leaves is sometimes known as L. cunninghamii, the second form has larger narrow glossy green leaves[219]. Plants seldom grow taller than about 2 metres in Britain. Resents root disturbance[200]. Does not regenerate from old wood[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. The seed remains viable for many years. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, early August in a frame. Over-winter in the greenhouse for its first year. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 4 - 5 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. Good percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
