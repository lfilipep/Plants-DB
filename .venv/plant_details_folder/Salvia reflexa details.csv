When soaked in water the seeds form a gelatinous mass which is flavoured with fruit juices and consumed as a cooling drink[183, 200]. The gelled seeds can also be prepared as a gruel or pudding[183]. The sprouted seeds are eaten in salads, sandwiches, soups, stews etc[183]. Due to their mucilaginous property they are often sprouted on clay or other porous materials[183]. The seed can be ground into a meal and made into bread, biscuits, cakes etc[183].",
