Asia - Siberia.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Eremurus spectabilis is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",E. caucasicus. Stephen.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"Young shoots - cooked[46, 61, 74]. Considered to be a delicacy in Siberia, the flavour is intermediate between purslane and spinach[2]. It is by no means a disagreeable vegetable[2].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Adhesive: Glues.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Size: Used on materials, paper etc to give a surface that will take ink, dyes etc.","The root contains about 30% gum (an arabinic acid derivative) and this makes a good quality glue[74]. The bulb is dried and powdered and then used for sizing cloth, bookbinding etc[114].",,"Prefers a very well drained, very rich, light sandy loam in a warm sunny sheltered position[90, 200]. A covering of sharp sand helps the plant to survive wet winters. Plants can also be mulched overwinter with organic matter in the autumn in order to give them extra protection, but this mulch must be removed in the spring otherwise it might encourage the new growth to rot[200]. Some protection should be given to the young shoots in spring in areas subject to late frosts[200]. Keep plants dry in summer after they have flowered[90]. A very ornamental plant[1] and a good bee plant[74]. Plants resent root disturbance and so should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[200]. This species, in part at least, is also known as E. caucasicus Stephen[50]. Tubers should be planted 15cm deep[1]. The edible young shoots are sold in local markets in Siberia[46]. Plants require some cold stratification in winter in order to flower well in the following summer[200]. Slugs are very attracted to this plant so some protection must be given.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is obtained. Germination is slow and could take 1 - 12 months at 15°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow on for their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring after the last expected frosts. Do not plant deeply in the soil, the crown of the plant should be slightly exposed[245]. Division after the plant dies down in late summer. Great care must be taken because the plants resent root disturbance[200]. Only divide the plants when it is really necessary, and no more frequently than once every 6 years, being careful not to break the brittle roots[245]. It is probably best to pot up the divisions and grow them on in the greenhouse until they are established.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
