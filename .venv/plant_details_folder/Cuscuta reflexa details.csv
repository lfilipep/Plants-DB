22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have virtually no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. One report says that it needs cold greenhouse treatment in this country[1] but some provenances from the higher parts of its range could succeed outdoors. This is a parasitic species that is devoid of leaves, roots or chlorophyll and so is totally dependant upon its host[238]. It must be grown next to the host plant, which it penetrates with suckers in order to obtain nutriment[238].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, by lodging it among the stems of a host plant that is being grown in a pot in the greenhouse[238].",
