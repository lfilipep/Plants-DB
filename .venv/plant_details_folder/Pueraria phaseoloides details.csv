13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pueraria phaseoloides is a CLIMBER at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The tuberous root can be eaten[105, 177, 183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Poultice  SkinA poultice of the plant is applied to ulcers and boils, especially in children[240]. A decoction is also used internally[240].",
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A forage crop and cover crop used in the tropics. Pueraria phaseoloides shows a high protein content in the seeds (12-20%) with high nutrient, protein (3.8%) and sugar (7.3%) content of the whole fresh plant (green part). Grown as a cover crop (often with Centro and Calopo) in oil palm, rubber and coconut. The main advantages as a cover crop are the comparable high nitrogen accumulation and the improvement of the soil structure due to its deep rooting system. It can be used as a grazed forage crop and as green manure in crop rotations. It can prevent soil erosion. In Africa, it is mainly used as cover crops in plantations whereas in tropical America, Southeast Asia it is used as a forage crop in mixtures and as cover crops.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Pasture  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Fodder  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropWe have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it is unlikely to be winter hardy in any but the very mildest parts of the country. It is probably possible to grow it as an annual crop, harvesting the root in the autumn. P. phaseoloides prefers to is grow in ruderal situations, such as plantations of cocoa or banana, at low altitudes (often under 600 metres above sea level) in wet evergreen or monsoon forests. P. phaseoloides is capable of growth in a large soil spectrum. Acid soils are not a problem and the pH tolerance is between 4.3 and 8. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sunny position in a well-drained soil[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a warm greenhouse in early spring. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts[200]. Cover the young plants with a frame or cloche until they are growing away well.,
