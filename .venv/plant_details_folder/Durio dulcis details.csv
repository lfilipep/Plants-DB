The wood is probably one of the most important sources of durian timber in Sarawak[ 338 ]. The relatively durable wood is used in interior construction and for making cheaper types of furniture and packing cases[ 303 ]. We do not have any more information on the wood of this species. However, a general description of the wood for species in this genus is as follows:- The heartwood is pink-brown, red, or deep red-brown; it is not always sharply demarcated from the white, pale yellow-brown or light reddish-yellow sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain straight to interlocked; somewhat lustrous; it is reported to have a foetid odour. The wood is not durable, and not resistant to termite attack; the sapwood is prone to powder-post beetle attack. It dries rapidly, but thin boards may tend to cup. The wood saws easily and generally dresses smoothly; nailing qualities are good. It is used for purposes such as furniture components, veneer and plywood, light construction[ 316 ].",,"A tree of the moist lowland tropics, it is found at elevations up to 800 metres[ 303 ].
