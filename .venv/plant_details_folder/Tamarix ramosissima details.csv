18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.",
19,Edible Uses Description,na is produced by the plants in response to insect damage to the stems[177]. It is sweet and mucilaginous and is used in confectionery[183].,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it makes a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens[75]. It does not like being trimmed[75]. Plants have an extensive root system and can be used to control the erosion of sand dunes and other sandy soils[200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Seashore. An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant of saline conditions[11]. This species is not found in saline soils in the wild and so might not be tolerant of them in cultivation[K]. Grows well in heavy clay soils as well as in sands and even shingle[182]. Usually found near the coast, it succeeds inland if given a fairly good deep loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerant of maritime winds and dry soils when grown near the coast[11], plants require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in non-saline soils because they use the soil salts that are found in saline soils to help them reduce transpiration[200]. This species flowers on the current year's growth[227]. Any pruning is best carried out in spring, hedges are also best trimmed at this time[188]. Plants are tolerant of severe pruning, sprouting freely from old wood[K]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15 - 25cm long, planted outdoors in late autumn in a nursery bed or straight into their permanent position. High percentage[11, 200].",
