It is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"Seed - cooked[2, 46, 61, 85, 95, 161]. The seed ripens in the latter half of summer and, when harvested and dried, can store for several years. It has a floury texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour. It can be used as a staple food crop in either savoury or sweet dishes. The seed can be cooked whole, though it is more commonly ground into a flour and used as a cereal in all the ways that oats are used, especially as a porridge but also to make biscuits, sourdough bread etc. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw or cooked in salads, stews etc. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.","Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Emollient  RefrigerantThe seeds are diuretic, emollient and refrigerant[240].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.","The straw has a wide range of uses such as for bio-mass, fibre, mulch, paper-making and thatching[171]. Some caution is advised in its use as a mulch since oat straw can infest strawberries with stem and bulb eelworm.",,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. Prefers a poor dry soil[134]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.5 to 6.5. A parent of the cultivated oat, A. sativa[57, 171] but the seeds are somewhat smaller and yields lower. This species could be of importance in breeding programmes for the cultivated oats (A. sativa), where it could confer drought tolerance, disease resistance and higher yields. Oats are in general easily grown plants but, especially when grown on a small scale, the seed is often completely eaten out by birds. Some sort of netting seems to be the best answer on a garden scale.",Seed - sow in situ in early spring or in the autumn. Only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
