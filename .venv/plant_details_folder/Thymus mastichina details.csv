See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall. In.,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","The leaves are used as a seasoning[183]. They have a pungent eucalyptus-like aroma[238]. If the leaves are to be dried, the plants should be harvested in early and late summer just before the flowers open and the leaves should be dried quickly[200]. The plant is also the source of an essential oil, called 'oil of marjoram', that is used extensively as a flavouring for soups etc[4, 61, 177, 183, 238].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Deodorant: Masks smells. Is this medicinal?,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Deodorant  DisinfectantThe leaves, and especially the essential oil contained in them, are strongly antiseptic, deodorant and disinfectant[4, 200, 238]. The plant can be used fresh at any time of the year, or it can be harvested as it comes into flower and either be distilled for the oil or dried for later use[238].","Deodorant: A pleasant smelling plant that is used on the body to mask the human smell.,Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.","The essential oil obtained from the leaves is also used in perfumery, as a mouth wash, medicinally etc[200].",,"Requires a light well-drained preferably calcareous soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Thymes dislike wet conditions, especially in the winter. A layer of gravel on the soil around them will help protect the foliage from wet soils[238]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[200], but are best given some protection in the winter - a pane of glass supported over the plant is usually sufficient[1]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are very attractive to honey bees[200]. The bruised leaves are powerfully aromatic[245]. This is a very difficult genus taxonomically, the species hybridize freely with each other and often intergrade into each other[1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed can also be sown in autumn in a greenhouse. Surface sow or barely cover the seed. Germination can be erratic. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
