Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional CropClimate: tropical. Humidity: semi-arid to humid.

A very variable plant, a number of varieties have been described[416 ].  Plants grow slowly. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Plants are grown from seed. The seeds from ripe fruit are removed and dried in the shade then planted. Seed - germinates easily[416 ]. It is best sown as soon as it is ripe and, since it does not transplant very well, is best sown in individual containers[419 ]. Germination rates are usually low, the seeds can be slow to sprout and also grow away slowly once they have sprouted[419 ].",
