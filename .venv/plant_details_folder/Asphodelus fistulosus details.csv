24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil, tolerating partial shade[200]. Requires a well-drained soil. Prefers a deep rich sandy loamy soil[1, 42]. Prefers a sunny position in a soil that is not too rich[200]. Grows well on hot dry banks[42]. This species is often a short-lived perennial[270], though it is not very hardy in Britain. This has contributed to the mistaken belief that it is an annual. A covering of bracken overwinter is usually ample protection in most districts[42]. Asphodelus fistulosus has become a noxious weed in California and in other places with Mediterranean climates worldwide[270]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. When the plants are large enough to handle, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division in early spring or autumn[111]."
