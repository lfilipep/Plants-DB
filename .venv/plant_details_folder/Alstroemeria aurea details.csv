24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing. Requires a fertile, moisture retentive well-drained soil and a warm situation in sun or semi-shade[200]. Another report says that it is easily grown in any soil in sun or part shade[190]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. Plants have proved very tolerant of neglect on our trial grounds in Cornwall, one clump grew and thrived in rank grass for a number of years until increasing shade from trees began to reduce its vigour[K]. This is the hardiest member of the genus, tolerating temperatures down to between -10 and -15°c, especially if the roots are mulched in the winter[187]. Young plants are best given a protective mulch for their first winter or two[233]. Somewhat intolerant of root disturbance[1], the roots are fleshy and brittle[200]. The plant can be rather invasive, spreading by means of thin fleshy roots[187]. Special Features: Attractive foliage, Suitable for cut flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe although seedlings can be transplanted successfully if they are moved with care whilst small. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hrs in warm water, warm stratify for 4 weeks at 25°c and then reduce the temperature to 10°c. Excising a small bit of the seed near the embryo after the seed has been warm stratified helps to speed up the germination process[164]. Plant out about 20cm deep into their permanent positions in late summer or autumn[200]. Division in April or October with care since the plant resents root disturbance[133]. Ensure each portion has a growth bud[111]. This species is so prolific that large clumps can be dug up in late summer for re-establishment[233]."
