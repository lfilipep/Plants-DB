It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from February to August, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",A. aurantiaca.

Requires a fertile, moisture retentive well-drained soil and a warm situation in sun or semi-shade[200]. Another report says that it is easily grown in any soil in sun or part shade[190]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. Plants have proved very tolerant of neglect on our trial grounds in Cornwall, one clump grew and thrived in rank grass for a number of years until increasing shade from trees began to reduce its vigour[K]. This is the hardiest member of the genus, tolerating temperatures down to between -10 and -15°c, especially if the roots are mulched in the winter[187]. Young plants are best given a protective mulch for their first winter or two[233]. Somewhat intolerant of root disturbance[1], the roots are fleshy and brittle[200]. The plant can be rather invasive, spreading by means of thin fleshy roots[187]. Special Features: Attractive foliage, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - best sown in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe although seedlings can be transplanted successfully if they are moved with care whilst small. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hrs in warm water, warm stratify for 4 weeks at 25°c and then reduce the temperature to 10°c. Excising a small bit of the seed near the embryo after the seed has been warm stratified helps to speed up the germination process[164]. Plant out about 20cm deep into their permanent positions in late summer or autumn[200]. Division in April or October with care since the plant resents root disturbance[133]. Ensure each portion has a growth bud[111]. This species is so prolific that large clumps can be dug up in late summer for re-establishment[233].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
