This species is not very hardy and is difficult to keep in British gardens[1], it requires protection from severe frosts and rain in the winter[1, 42]. A pane of glass supported over the plant is often sufficient[200]. Best results are obtained from growing the plant in a frame[1]. The bulbs can also be lifted in early autumn and stored in a cool dry but frost-free place over winter and then planted out in early spring[200].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a warm greenhouse. Sow the seed thinly so that the young plants can grow on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Give the seedlings an occasional liquid feed during the growing season to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. When the plants become dormant, pot up the small bulbs placing two or three in each pot. Grow on the plants for at least another 2 years in a greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant.
