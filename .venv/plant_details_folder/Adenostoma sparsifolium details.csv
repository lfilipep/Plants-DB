Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The plant is cathartic[257]. The plant has been used externally in the treatment of arthritis[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been used in the treatment of colds and chest complaints, and also as a mouth wash to treat toothaches[257]. An infusion of the dried leaves, or the branches, has been used in the treatment of stomach ailments, inducing either bowel movements or vomiting[257]. The crushed twigs have been mixed with oil and used as a salve[257].",,"The bark is fibrous and has been stripped off the plants to make women's skirts[257].

Plants are not very hardy in Britain and do not withstand exposure to prolonged winter frosts though they succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[182, 200]. In colder areas they are best grown against a south or south-west facing wall[200]. The leaves are resinous and catch fire easily[181]. They have a pleasant aroma[200].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow the plants on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse or cold frame, planting them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings could be tried in August of half-ripe wood, preferably with a heel, in a frame.
