0,Rumex hydrolapathum,Great Water Dock,Polygonaceae,5-9,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Near ponds and streams, also in shallow water, avoiding acid conditions[17].","Western Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to Spain, Italy and S.
