23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sheltered position in a rich moist soil[1]. Plants are not very hardy in most areas of Britain, though they succeed outdoors in the south and west of the country, producing fertile seed in W. Britain[200]. A very slow growing species[167], trees can succeed in the southern part of Britain but the best growth is found in wetter areas such as Cornwall and Ireland[185].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in a cool greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 7 - 10cm long in early autumn (October), in sandy soil in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months[78].",
