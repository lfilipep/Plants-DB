It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",,"The flowers and leaves are used as potherbs[177, 179, 183]. The leaves are slightly hairy but they have a very pleasant taste raw, with a pleasant sweetness[K].

Succeeds in most fertile well-drained soils[233], though it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Plants are hardy in most parts of Britain but are best grown in pots in a cold greenhouse[1]. Another report says that it is very well suited to the ornamental garden[200]. This species has proved to be difficult of cultivation in many gardens, though it spreads freely in others[221] and can become invasive[233]. It probably requires a very light soil, and is more inclined to die out when growing in clay[221, 271]. Where successful, the plants usually produce an abundance of seed and sometimes self-sow[221, 271]. Closely related to C. takesimana[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. Easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
