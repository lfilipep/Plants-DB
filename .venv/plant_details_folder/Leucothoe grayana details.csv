22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free well-drained humus-rich soil and some shade[1, 182]. Requires a moist peaty soil or a sandy loam with added leafmold[11]. Plants are tolerant of transplanting, which is best carried out in the autumn[200]. The flowers are produced on the current years growth[182]. A number of named forms have been developed in Japan for their ornamental value[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a shady part of the greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination is variable. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, August in a frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn. Takes 12 months. Very high percentage[78]."
