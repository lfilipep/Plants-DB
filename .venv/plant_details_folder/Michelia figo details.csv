Requires a neutral to acid soil according to other reports[188, 219]. Although not very frost-hardy, plants have survived in sheltered positions outdoors in southern England[200], tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[260]. They require the protection of a cold greenhouse at Kew gardens[11]. The flowers have a banana scent[188]. This is one of the most fragrant of all shrubs with a scent strongly resembling the sweet 'pear drops'[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - probably best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it can also be sown in the spring[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of greenwood, summer in a frame[200]."
