13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cudrania tricuspidata is a deciduous Tree growing to 6 m (19ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower in July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - fresh or preserved[1, 22, 61]. Somewhat like a mulberry[183]. The firm fruit is relatively tasteless, when soft-ripe it is sub-acid to sweet and some forms can be quite delicious[46, 105, 109, 151, 183]. It contains lots of large seeds[151]. The fruit is about 25mm in diameter[200]. Leaves - a famine food[179]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Galactogogue  Malaria  Ophthalmic  Women's complaintsAn infusion of the wood is used to treat sore or weak eyes[178, 218]. The inner bark and the wood are used in the treatment of malaria, debility and menorrhagia[178, 218]. The root is galactogogue and is also used in the treatment of amenorrhoea[218]. The plant is used to eliminate blood stasis and stimulate the circulation in cancer of the alimentary system, blood and lungs[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the wood[178]. The bark fibers are used for making paper[266].  - finely grained. Used for utensils[178].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm well-drained fertile loam[1, 188]. Requires a sunny position[188]. A very hardy plant[1]. The leaves are a food source for silk-worms[1, 11]. Probably only the male tree is in cultivation in Britain, though at least one selected female form is being grown in N. America[183]. Both male and female plants normally need to be grown if fruit or seed is required but male trees occasionally produce a few small fruits[183]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A sprouting standard sending up shoots from the base [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[188]. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[188, K]. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a sandy soil in a frame[1]."
