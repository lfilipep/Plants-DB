Avoid if over active thyroid gland. High doses cause vomiting, lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate, lethargy, nose bleed, skin & eye irritation and kidney infection. Liquorice as Glycyrrhiza species nullify berberine effects [301].",Mixed coniferous woods to 2000 metres. It is found in woods and hedgerows in Britain[17].,Western N. America.

The fruit is almost as large as a blackcurrant and is produced in large bunches so it is easy to harvest. It has medicinal and other uses. Cultivars have Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: M. × wagneri 'Pinnacle' (M. aquifolium × M. pinnata) and 'Apollo’. Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring to Mid spring. Evergreen, upright or spreading. Pinnately compound leaves with 5-11 shiny, green, holly like leaflets. Leathery, oblong leaflets flat to strongly wavy with sharp, spine-tipped teeth. Yellow flowers in dense racemes at branch tips. Sour Dark bluish berries covered with white film. Form: Upright or erect.","Mahonia aquifolium is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to May, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Berberis aquifolium. Berberis fascicularis. Odostemon aquifolium.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover; Hedge;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ","Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.","Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 5, 95]. The fruit is almost as large as a blackcurrant and is produced in large bunches so it is easy to harvest[K]. It has an acid flavour, but it is rather nice raw and is especially good when added to a porridge or muesli[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds, though some plants have larger and juicier fruits[K]. The cooked fruit tastes somewhat like blackcurrants[K]. The fruit can also be dried and stored for later use[257]. Flowers - raw. They can also be used to make a lemonade-like drink[183].","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antipsoriatic: Used to treat psoriasis (an autoimmune disease that affects the skin).,Antiseborrheic: Used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Blood tonic: Is this any different to a blood purifier?,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antibacterial  Antipsoriatic  Antiseborrheic  Antitumor  Blood tonic  Cholagogue  Diuretic  Dysentery  Laxative  Ophthalmic  TonicOregon grape was often used by several native North American Indian tribes to treat loss of appetite and debility[254]. Its current herbal use is mainly in the treatment of gastritis and general digestive weakness, to stimulate the kidney and gallbladder function and to reduce catarrhal problems[254, 257]. The root and root bark is alterative, blood tonic, cholagogue, diuretic, laxative and tonic[4, 21, 165, 257]. It improves the digestion and absorption and is taken internally in the treatment of psoriasis, syphilis, haemorrhages, stomach complaints and impure blood conditions[4, 238]. Externally, it has been used as a gargle for sore throats and as a wash for blurry or bloodshot eyes[257]. The roots are harvested in late autumn or early spring and dried for later use[238]. The fruit is an excellent gentle and safe laxative[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark of the stem and roots[99, 101, 257]. It is green according to another report[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. This species can be grown as a low hedge and does not need trimming. Because of its suckering habit, it also makes a good dense ground cover plant though it can be slow to become established[197, 200].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Pest tolerant, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. A very easy plant to grow, thriving in any good garden soil[11, 200] and tolerating dense shade under trees[1, 28]. It grows well in heavy clay soils and also succeeds in dry soils if it is given a good mulch annually[197]. It dislikes exposure to strong winds[K]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. Very tolerant of pruning, plants can be cut back into old wood if they grow too large and straggly[238]. Spring is the best time to do this[238]. Suckers are fairly freely produced, with established plants forming dense thickets[200]. Most plants grown under this name are casual hybrids with M. repens[67]. This species is easily confused with M. pinnata[67], with which it also hybridizes[200]. The flowers are delicately scented[245]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. This plant is the state flower of Oregon[95]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
