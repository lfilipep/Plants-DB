We do not have any more information for this species, but the general description for the wood of the tropical members of this genus is as follows:- The heartwood is chocolate-brown and generally darker than the North American black walnut (Juglans nigra), sometimes with a purplish cast; it is sharply demarcated from the whitish sapwood. The texture is rather coarse; the grain is straight to irregular; luster is high; odour and taste are mild but distinctive. The wood dries very slowly, wet zones persist, and severe honeycombing and collapse may occur in stock thicker than 10cm x 10cm. The wood works well, cutting cleanly with hand and machine tools and taking an excellent finish. It also peels and slices readily but the veneers are also reported to dry slowly. It is used for decorative veneers, furniture, cabinet work, interior finish, and other applications similar to the North American black walnut[316 ].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilA tree mainly found at medium elevations in the tropics, most commonly between 400 - 1,600 metres, though there is one report of a specimen collected near sea level in Nicaragua.
