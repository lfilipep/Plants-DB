24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Arbor, Espalier. Tolerates most soils[200], thriving in a well-drained loamy soil[1], but resenting dryness at the roots[11, 200]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[200], but if it is grown in a low rainfall area then it requires shade at the hottest part of the day[11]. Does well on very acid soils with a pH around 4.5[200]. The colour of the flowers reflects the pH of the soil the plant is growing in, the flowers are pink in a neutral to alkaline soil and blue in an acid soil. Although the dormant plant is quite hardy in Britain, the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. A fast-growing self-clinging climbing plant[208], attaching itself by means of aerial roots[200], and growing up walls or tree trunks on any aspect. The plants may need initial support, however[200]. Plants are growing well on a wall at Kew[11]. Grows well on north walls but prefers a sunnier position[208]. Closely related to H. petiolaris[11]. H. petiolaris is normally treated as no more than a sub-species of this species[200]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse in spring[113]. Cover the pot with paper until the seed germinates[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 8cm long, July/August in a frame. Overwinter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in late autumn in a frame[200]. Mound layering in spring. Takes 12 months[78]. Basal softwood cuttings of non-flowering shoots[200]. Leaf-bud cuttings of the current seasons growth in a frame[200]."
