The fruit is also sometimes used, but it is less active than the leaves[4]. The herb is commonly used in the treatment of liver and kidney complaints[4]. When bruised and laid on boils and scalds, they have a healing effect[4]. They can be made into a poultice for treating swellings and contusions[4]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[7]. The root is diaphoretic, mildly diuretic and a drastic purgative[4, 7, 9]. Dried, then powdered and made into a tea, it is considered to be one of the best remedies for dropsy[4, 240].

24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Division in spring or autumn."
