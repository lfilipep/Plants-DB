0,Sambucus racemosa kamtschatica,Red Elder,Caprifoliaceae,4-8,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves and stems of some, if not all, members of this genus are poisonous[9, 76]. The fruit of this species has been known to cause stomach upsets to some people. Any toxin the fruit might contain is liable to be of very low toxicity and is destroyed when the fruit is cooked[65, 76]. The seed is said to be poisonous[21].","Woods, mainly in mountains[50].",Europe to W. Asia. Occasionally naturalized in N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.

Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position. Prefers cool moist conditions. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations. Hardy to about -25°c[184]. Plants self-sow in N. Britain but they rarely fruit well in S. Britain[3, 182]. There are some named varieties developed for their ornamental value[182]. The flowers have a sweet smell, free from the fishy undertones found in some other members of the genus[245]. This subspecies has larger fruits and seeds than the type[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with a heel, late autumn in a frame or a sheltered outdoor bed[78].
