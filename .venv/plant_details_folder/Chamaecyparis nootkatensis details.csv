14,Physical Characteristics,"Chamaecyparis nootkatensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution."

18,Medicinal Uses,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Miscellany  Poultice  SkinThe plant has been used in sweat baths for treating rheumatism and arthritis[257]. An infusion of the branch tips has been used as a wash for sores and swellings[257]. A poultice of the crushed leaves has been applied to sores[257]. The soft bark has been used as a cover for poultices[257].
20,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as a tall hedge[200] They are very tolerant of clipping so long as this does not extend into the brown barked wood since trees cannot regenerate from this[200]. Any trimming should be done in the summer[200]. The fibre of the inner bark is fine and soft, it is pounded and spun then used for making blankets, clothing, capes, mats etc[99, 226, 257]. Torn into pieces, it can be used as bandages or for washing babies[226]. The finely shredded inner bark can be used as a tinder[257].  - hard, very durable, fragrant with an agreeable resinous odour, close grained, has low-shrinkage, is somewhat brittle, but does not splinter. Easily worked, it is used for carving, cabinet work, making boats, implements etc[1, 46, 61, 82, 99, 171, 226]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Screen. Succeeds in most soils and situations, but prefers a moist deep loamy soil and a sheltered position[1, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Survives on dry alkaline soils[200]. Does not grow well on peat or shallow chalky soils[11]. Growth of trees is hardly affected by a lack of phosphate in the soil. Plants are moderately shade tolerant, especially when young[81, 200]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution according to one report[200], whilst another says that they do not do well in a polluted atmosphere[1]. Plants are hardy to about -35c, they also tolerate low summer temperatures[200]. A very polymorphic species, there are many named varieties[200]. This species establishes well and grows fairly quickly when young[11]. Trees can reach 20 metres tall in 35 years but growth slows as the trees get older[185]. It is cultivated as a timber tree in Europe[50]. Trees in the wild can live for 1,000 years or longer[226], one specimen is believed to be 3,500 years old[229]. This longevity is probably due to the presence of toxic chemical compounds from microscopic fungi concentrated in the heartwood[226]. The wood and foliage have an acrid odour[226]. The bruised foliage releases a smell of turpentine[245]. Favoured by many birds for roosting, high cover and especially for nesting, large specimens of this tree help to attract songbirds to the garden[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a seedbed outdoors[78]. The seed is best sown in pots in a frame[K]. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. One month warm then one month cold stratification has produced good results[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in late summer or autumn in sandy soil in a cold frame[1, 11, 200]. Difficult, it may be best done in late winter to early spring[113]."
