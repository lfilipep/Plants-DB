See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from February to March, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,"- raw or cooked[172, 183]. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - raw or cooked. They are not very palatable[172]. Rich in vitamin C[183]. Young catkin-bearing shoots - raw or cooked[183]. The growing tips of underground rhizomes are peeled and eaten[183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Febrifuge  Vitamin CThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[1, 61, 74, 131, 158] or for making wattle and daub walls[158]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. Trees are fast growing and tolerate maritime exposure so can be grown as a shelterbelt[166]. Plants have extensive root systems and are often used to stabilize sand dunes[11, 200].  - soft, even grained, smooth. Used for construction, pales, tubs etc[146, 158]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1], but prefers a deep damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[11, 200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Succeeds in poor strong soils[131]. Succeeds in maritime exposure[166]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. It is best not to plant this species within 10 metres of buildings. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. A very ornamental and fast growing plant[1, 74]. There are some named varieties. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.
