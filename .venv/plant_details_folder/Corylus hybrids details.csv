23,Cultivation Details Description,"Climate: boreal to warm temperate, Mediterranean. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: standard, coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in early spring. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
