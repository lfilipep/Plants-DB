0,Pinus jeffreyi,Jeffrey Pine,Pinaceae,5-8,"The wood, sawdust and resins from various species of pine can cause dermatitis in sensitive people[222].","Usually found on dry and exposed slopes, 1800 - 2700 metres in California[71, 82]. Found on a variety of soils, but growing best in those that are deep and well-drained[229].",South-western N. America - Oregon to California.,(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PinusJeffreyi.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PinusJeffreyi2.jpg","Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Pyramidal.","Pinus jeffreyi is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from January to February. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",P. ponderosa jeffreyi.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","d - raw or cooked[105, 177]. Large[183]. The oil-rich seed has a resinous flavour and is about 10 - 12mm long[82, 200]. The crystallised sap has been gathered and eaten like candy[257]. A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Landscape Uses: Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen.  A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc. The resin contained in this plant is very unusual in that it contains the hydrocarbon n-heptane. This is unmixed with other isomers of heptane and is formed by a very complex and little understood biochemical process. Its purity lead it to be used as the zero-point in the octane rating for petrol[200].  - light, strong and fine-grained, it can vary from soft to hard[229]. It is used for making furniture, boxes, toys etc[229]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Timber: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional TimberSucceeds in most soils[129], but prefers a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[120]. It is often short-lived in Britain but is moderately fast growing with some trees reaching a height of 15 metres in 29 years[185]. A long-lived tree in the wild, specimens 500 years old are known[229]. It commences bearing seeds when about 10 - 15 years old, though good production does not commence until twice that age[229]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby inhibiting the growth of other plants below the tree[18]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Closely related to P. ponderosa[1], and hybridizes with it in the wild[71]. Some of the earlier plantings under this name in Britain have turned out to be P. ponderosa[185]. The cones are 12 - 35cm long, they open and shed their seed whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226]. The resin from broken shoots has a very strong lemon scent[185]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. An evergreen. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
