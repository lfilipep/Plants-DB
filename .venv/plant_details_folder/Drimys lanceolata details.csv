24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a light lime-free soil in semi-shade[200]. Prefers a fertile moist but well-drained soil[188]. A fairly hardy species, surviving very cold winters in various parts of the country so long as it is in a suitable position[120]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -15°c[184], but plants are liable to be damaged in cold winters. This species is hardier than D. winteri according to one report[120] whilst another says that it is less hardy than D. winteri[200]. All parts of the plant are very aromatic and pungent[182, 184]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants are usually dioecious though monoecious and hermaphrodite forms are known. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Approximately 60% take[78]. Layering in March/April. Takes 12 months[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth with a heel of older wood, November in a cold frame[78]."
