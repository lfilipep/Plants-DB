13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring, Mid winter. Form: Upright or erect."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Mahonia lomariifolia is an evergreen Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to March, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. The oval fruit is about 5 - 8mm long, it is quite juicy and has a nice acid flavour that children tend to love though many adults are less sure. The fruit is especially nice when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is often relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds, though plants often also produce seedless fruits[K]. Unlike many members of this species, the seedless fruits of this plant do not have a bitter flavour[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Dysentery  TonicBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Succeeds in any good garden soil. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes windy positions. Prefers a shady sheltered position, growing well in woodland according to one report whilst another says that it requires a warm sunny sheltered position. This species tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c when it is fully dormant[184], but plants can be badly damaged by cold drying winds[184] and are not fully hardy in the colder parts of Britain. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. The flowers are fragrant[245]. There is some confusion over the flowering and fruiting times of this species, I have seen some plants flowering in mid to late spring, whilst others have flowered in the winter and ripen their fruit in late spring to early summer - more research needs to be carried out in order to check if more than one species is grown under this name[K]. Very tolerant of pruning, it can be cut right back into old wood if it has outgrown its welcome[182]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Resistant to honey fungus[88]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11]. Leaf cuttings in the autumn."
