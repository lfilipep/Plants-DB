0,Viburnum lantana,"Wayfaring Tree, Wayfaring Tree Viburnum",Adoxaceae,4-7,"Large quantities of the fruit can cause vomiting and diarrhoea[10, 65]. The fruit is of very low or zero toxicity, it only causes mild upsets when eaten unripe or in large quantities[76].","Open woodland and woodland edges, especially on calcareous soils[10, 17].","Europe, including Britain, from Belgium south and east to Spain, Greece and W. Asia.",(1 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ViburnumLantana.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ViburnumLantana2.jpg","Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.","Viburnum lantana is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails[177]. The oblong fruit is about 8mm long and contains a single large seed[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.",The young stems can be used as a twine[6]. This species is used as a rootstock for all forms of viburnums that require grafting[202].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Screen, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but is ill-adapted for poor soils and for dry situations[1]. Unlike most members of the genus, this species succeeds on dry soils[186]. It prefers a deep rich moist loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200], growing well on chalk and on chalky clays[98]. Intolerant of water-logged soils[186]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. Dislikes atmospheric pollution[186]. Plants regenerate well after cutting[186]. This plant is a good indicator of limy soils[186]. Tolerates light shade in a woodland[186]. One report says the plant is self-sterile[11], another that it is self-fertile[17]. It would be wise to grow at least two genetically distinct plants of the same species in order to make sure that fruit and seed is produced. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
