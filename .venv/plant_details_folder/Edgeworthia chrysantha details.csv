Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.OphthalmicThe sliced root is used as a remedy for eye diseases[218].,"Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.","A high-class paper is made from the bark[1, 11, 58, 61]. The bark fibres are used[61]. The stems are harvested in spring or early summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The outer bark is removed from the inner by peeling or scraping. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with soda ash and then beaten with mallets or put through a blender. The paper is off white in colour[189]. The stems are extremely supple and can be tied in knots[11, 182].",,"Succeeds in any soil in sun or part shade[175, 184, 200], growing well in light woodland[200]. Prefers a well-drained soil with plenty of moisture in the growing season[1, 200]. This species is hardy to about -15°c according to one report[184], though others say that it is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1, 11]. It succeeds on a wall at Kew[K] and as a free-standing shrub in Cornwall[11]. The plant is frost hardy, but the flowers are susceptible to frost damage[188]. The plant is best grown on a south or west-facing wall[188]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be put into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. This species is cultivated in Japan for the paper that can be made from the bark[1, 11, 109]. The stems are harvested every second year[61]. This species is very closely related to and scarcely distinct from E. gardneri and E. papyrifera[200]. The flowers diffuse a pronounced clove-like perfume and will scent the air to some distance on a calm day[245].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Place the pot in a plastic bag to keep it moist[175]. The seed might germinate in the spring, though it could take another 12 months. Stored seed usually requires 8 - 12 weeks warm stratification at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c[175]. Germination can still take 12 months or more at 15°c[175]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and grow on in a greenhouse for at least a year before planting out in late spring or early summer[175]. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings in spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
