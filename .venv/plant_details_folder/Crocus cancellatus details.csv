24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows best on a gritty well-drained slope[42]. Plants succeed outdoors if they are given perfect drainage in a warm sunny position[200], otherwise they are better grown in a bulb frame[90]. Bulbs should be planted 5 - 7cm deep in the soil[79]. June is the best time to do this[245]. This species includes C. edulis, which is a synonym of C. cancellatus damascenus[42]. The corms are sold in local markets in Syria[89]. Plants tend to move considerably from their original planting place because of their means of vegetative reproduction, it is therefore wise not to grow different species in close proximity[1]. The flowers are only open during the day time, closing at night[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a light sandy soil in pots in a cold frame[1]. The seed can also be sown in a cold frame in early spring[1]. Sow thinly because the seed usually germinates freely[1], within 1 - 6 months at 18°c[164]. Unless the seed has been sown too thickly, do not transplant the seedlings in their first year of growth, but give them regular liquid feeds to make sure they do not become deficient. Divide the small bulbs once the plants have died down, planting 2 - 3 bulbs per 8cm pot. Grow them on for another 2 years in a greenhouse or frame and plant them out into their permanent positions when dormant in late summer[K]. Plants take 3 - 4 years to flower from seed[200]. Division of the clumps after the leaves die down in spring[1, 200]. The bulbs can be replanted direct into their permanent positions if required."
