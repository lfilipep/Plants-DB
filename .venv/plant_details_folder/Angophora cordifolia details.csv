Tolerates poor and dry soils, especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200], but they are not very wind resistant[77]. Plants succeed outdoors in Britain only in the very mildest areas of the country[200]. They are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species. We have used the name A. cordifolia Cav. - one synonym of this species is given as A. costata. (Gaertn.)Britten. Some of the information we have included here was listed under A. costata. Domin., which we have assumed is the same species. Trees lose their branches in high winds[157]. They sheds their bark annually[167].","Seed - sow April in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. If trying them outdoors, plant them out in early summer and give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors.
