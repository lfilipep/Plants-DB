Established plants are drought tolerant[420 ]. Young plants have a moderate rate of growth[420 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A high germination rate can usually be expected from fresh seed, with the seed sprouting within 8 - 15 days[420 ]. When the seedlings are 4 - 5cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 4 - 5 months later[420 ]. The seed has a limited viability of less than 60 days in storage[420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
