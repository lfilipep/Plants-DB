24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a light or medium lime-free soil[11, 182], succeeding in full sun or light shade[182]. Plants are growing very well in a sandy peat in a garden near London[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruit is required[182]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 5 months warm stratification followed by 3 months at 5°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a frame."
