By.,None known,"Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Attractive oak leaf shaped balsam scented leaves, the flowers are light to dark pink with dark purple markings.",,"An easily grown plant, it requires a light well-drained neutral to alkaline rather dry soil in a sunny position[188, 200, 260]. Plants are not very cold-hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c or perhaps a bit lower[260]. They generally require greenhouse protection but might succeed outdoors when grown in a very sheltered warm spot in the mildest parts of the country[1]. They can also be grown in containers that are placed outdoors in the summer and then brought into the greenhouse or conservatory for the winter[238]. The plants need to be kept fairly dry in the winter[200]. The bruised leaves release a warm pungent aroma rather like incense[245]. Very tolerant of pruning, they can be cut right down to the base in the autumn when bringing them back indoors, or in the spring to encourage lots of fresh growth[238].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Stored seed should be sown in early spring in a greenhouse. The seed germinates best with a minimum temperature of 13°c, germination usually taking place within 2 weeks though it sometimes takes some months[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. If trying them outdoors, plant them out in early summer and consider giving them extra protection during the winter. Cuttings succeed at almost any time in the growing season but early summer is the best time in order for the new plant to become established before winter.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
