See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",M. nagi. non Thunb.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 105]. Succulent and aromatic[82], it has an agreeable sub-acid taste[183]. Juicy, sweetish and sour according to another report[174]. The fruit soon rots so it is difficult to grow commercially because of the problems of getting it to market in good condition[174]. The fruit is up to 25mm in diameter[200]. The seed is said to be edible[61, 177, 183].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Thrives in any ordinary garden soil[11]. Prefers a lime-free loamy or peaty soil[1]. Not very hardy in Britain, it succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country according to one report[1], whilst another says that it only succeeds in zone 10 and does not tolerate frosts[200]. Plants succeed outdoors in Japan as far north as Tokyo, but it is difficult to get them to fruit there[174].. This plant has been recommended for improvement by selection and breeding for its edible fruit. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Many species in this genus have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Barely cover the seed and keep it moist. Stored seed germinates more freely if given a 3 month cold stratification and then sown in a cold frame. Germination is usually good[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in the cold frame for the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up and overwinter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in November/December in a frame. Layering in spring[200]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
