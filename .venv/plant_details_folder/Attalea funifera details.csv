There are 5 to 15 long leaves with irregularly arranged leaflets. The fruit is very large, with 1-3 seeds. Oil can be obtained from the seed and fruit, while fibre can be obtained from the leaves. Young, undeveloped plants of this palm also yields fibre called bananeiras. The leaves are used for thatching while the seeds are used to carve buttons and as beads. The fruits, on the other hand, can be used in charcoal-making.","Attalea funifera is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Beetles, Flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Attalea acaulis Burret Lithocarpos cocciformis O.Targ.Tozz. ex Steud. Sarinia funifera (Mart.)

See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.","Other uses rating: High (4/5). Other Uses: A good oil is produced from the seed[ 46 , 769 ]. It can be used for oiling watches and other fine instruments[ 769 ]. An oil is obtained from the fruit[ 769 ]. A long fibre obtained from the leaves is used for various purposes[ 46 ]. This palm is widely used locally for its high quality, stiff fibres which are used in making ropes, mats, and brushes[ 314 ]. The fibre is strong, and hard and it does not absorb moisture easily[ 314 ]. A fibre obtained from the dilated base of the leaf stalks, which separates into a long, coarse fringe, is collected by cutting with a small axe. The fibre is stiff, wiry, and a bright chocolate in colour. It is employed in the manufacture of brushes, these are largely used on street-sweeping machines, particularly in London. The fibres can be twisted into coarse cables, which are light, durable and float on the water[ 454 ].  from young, undeveloped plants, known as 'bananeiras' is bright coloured and more flexible[ 454 ].  from fully matured plants is separated into three qualities:- (1) Ordinary fibre, which is found wound up among the broken leaves and the upper part of the trunk. (2) Balloon, formed by the older fibre which has fallen to the ground around the base of the trunk. (3) Piassava d'olho, or 'eye piassava', which is the latest growth, and is in all respects similar to that yielded by the 'bananeiras'. The latter, on account of its flexibility and colour, is chiefly used in tying the bales. Its yield is small[ 454 ]. The leaves are used for thatching[ 768 ]. The seeds can be used to carve buttons and beads for rosaries etc[ 769 ]. The fruits have been used to make a good quality charcoal[ 769 ].","Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 400 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22° - 25°c, but can tolerate 18° - 30°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 5°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,500 - 2,400mm[ 418 ]. Prefers a moist soil and a warm, sunny position[ 314 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 5.5, tolerating 4.5 - 6.5[ 418 ]. The seedlings grow down into the soil for 3 - 4 years, producing a stem below ground to a depth of 100 - 150cm. After a few more years a trunk may begin to form at ground level[ 418 ]. Young plants generally produce inflorescences with male flowers, whilst older, taller plants are more likely to produce female inflorescences[ 768 ]. Production: The melting point of oil is 25-26C. A kernel weighs 3g. They contain about 67% oil. About 7.5 kg of seeds can be harvested by hand in one day.",Seed - The large seeds are slow and erratic to germinate.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
