See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Young shoots in spring - cooked. The shoots, which are 3 - 4cm in diameter[266], are harvested when about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level. They are usually boiled and are free from bitterness[195].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,Canes are very hard and are used in making fine furniture[195]. The tough splints from culms are good for weaving fine bamboo articles[266].,,"Prefers a rich damp soil in a sheltered position and some shade[200]. Grows well in a woodland. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Closely related to P. flexuosa[200, 266]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants have shallow root systems that do not compete with deep tree roots[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
