It is used for the manufacture of tool handles, fence posts, general construction etc[419 ]. We do not have any more information on the wood of this species, but a general description of the wood for trees in the Americas which were formerly considered to be in the genus Rheedia is as follows:- The heartwood is dark yellow-brown, grayish- or pinkish-brown, merging gradually into the sapwood; surfaces are sometimes specked with resinous exudations. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain straight to irregular and roey; luster medium to rather low; it is free from discernible odour or taste. Species in Surinam are rated durable to attack by decay fungi and fairly resistant to dry wood termites. Species in Colombia are resistant to a brown-rot fungus but not the white-rot in a laboratory assay. Under field conditions the wood was susceptible to decay and attack by insects. It dries rapidly, but is reported to be moderately difficult to air season, tending to warp and check. Reports on workability vary with species from moderate to high resistance to cutting to machining fairly well; reports on ease of finishing are also variable. The wood is used for purposes such as furniture, flooring (quarter sawn), heavy construction, and general carpentry[316 ].",,"Although in nature the tree grows in the shade of the rainforest, it produces more fruit when growing in a sunny position[419 ]. Trees can withstand periodic inundation[419 ]. Newly planted young trees are slow to establish and grow away[419 ]. Young trees, planted in a sunny position, commence fruiting sooner than plants growing in shady positions[419 ].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, in a shady position in individual containers. A germination rate in excess of 80% is usually achieved with the seed sprouting in 60 - 80 days. The seedlings grow away slowly[419 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
