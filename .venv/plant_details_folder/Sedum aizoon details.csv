24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden. A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils[188], tolerating those on the poor side[233], though it prefers a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200] although it prefers a soil that stays moist in the summer[187]. Requires a sunny position[188]. Hardy to -15°c according to one report[200] whilst another says that it is hardy to about -25°c[187]. A polymorphic species[1]. Butterflies are attracted to the flowers of this plant[233]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species, such as this one, that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
