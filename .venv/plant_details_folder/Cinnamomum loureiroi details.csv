The bark is sweeter than cinnamon and is used for baking and is made into a cordial[ 238 ]. The bark is usually harvested from young branches[ 418 ]. The bark is peeled from the stems and branches and set aside to dry. Some varieties are scraped. While drying, the bark curls into quills. The colour varies from light reddish brown for the thin, scraped bark to grey for the thick, unscraped bark[ 418 ]. The unripe fruits are dried and sold as cassia buds, for use as food flavourings[ 301 ]. They have a cinnamon-like aroma and a warm, sweet, pungent taste akin to that of cassia bark[ 418 ].",

It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature is 20 - 30°c, but tolerates 17 - 34°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall of 2,500 - 3,000mm, tolerating 1,500 - 3,500mm[ 418 ]. It grows in areas with all year rainfall and also with a distinct dry season[ 418 ]. Prefers a fertile, sandy, moisture-retentive but freely draining soil in full sun or partial shade[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.4, tolerating 4.5 - 8[ 418 ]. Harvest of superior bark cannot usually take place until the trees are at least 10 - 12 years old[ 418 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - the seed has a short viability and is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[ 200 ]. Remove the fruit pulp since this can inhibit germination[ 200 ]. Germination can take 1 - 6 months at 20°c[ 164 ]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in containers[ 78 ]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions when 10cm or more tall. Cuttings of semi-ripe side shoots, 7cm with a heel, June/July in a frame with bottom heat[ 78 ].",
