See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Nemexia herbacea (L.)

The fruit is about 10mm in diameter[200]. Root - cooked[257]. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then used with cereals for making bread etc[62, 102]. It can also be used as a gelatine substitute[62, 102].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiaphonic: Restores the voice.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A vigorous plant, it can be grown through trees or shrubs or over tree stumps[200]. The sub-species S. herbacea nipponicum is used in Japan[61]. This report probably refers to the species S. nipponica[K]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. Herbaceous.","Seed - sow March in a warm greenhouse[1]. This note probably refers to the tropical members of the genus, seeds of plants from cooler areas seem to require a period of cold stratification, some species taking 2 or more years to germinate[K]. We sow the seed of temperate species in a cold frame as soon as we receive it, and would sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if we could obtain it then[K]. When the seedlings eventually germinate, prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year, though we normally grow them on in pots for 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in early spring as new growth begins[238]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots, July in a frame[238].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
