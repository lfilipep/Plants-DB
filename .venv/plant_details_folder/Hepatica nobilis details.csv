22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep light alkaline soil with leafmould[200, 238]. Another report says that it grows best in a deep loam or clay soil[4]. Grows well on limey woodland soils in half shade, though it also succeeds in deep shade and in full sun[1]. A very ornamental plant[1]. It grows well in the rock garden[1] and in the woodland[188]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a moist soil in a shady position[1]. The stored seed requires stratification for about 3 weeks at 0 - 5°c. Germination takes 1 - 12 months at 10°c. It is probably worthwhile sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division just as the leafless plant comes into flower in late winter. Replant immediately into their permanent positions.",
