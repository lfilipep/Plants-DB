24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any wet to moisture retentive ground, pond margins and shallow water in full sun or shade[200]. A polymorphic species[60]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in a pot standing in 3cm of water. Only just cover the seed with soil[200]. The seed usually germinates fairly quickly. Prick out the plants when large enough to handle and plant out in their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
