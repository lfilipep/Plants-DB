0,Prunus davidiana,Chinese Wild Peach,Rosaceae,4-8,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Forests, thickets, slopes, mountain valleys and waste fields at elevations of 800 - 3200 metres[266].",E. Asia - China.,(2 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PrunusDavidiana.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PrunusDavidiana2.jpg",,"Prunus davidiana is a deciduous Tree growing to 9 m (29ft) by 9 m (29ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to May, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Amygdalus davidiana. (Carr.)Nash. Persica davidiana.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"The seed is used in China as a flavouring in confectionery and some special dishes. They are somewhat bitter due to the presence of prussic acid so should be used in strict moderation[177, 183]. Fruit[183]. The fruit is about 3cm in diameter and contains one large seed[200].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Anticoagulant: Removes blood clots.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Haemolytic: Breaks down red blood corpuscles to separate haemoglobin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiasthmatic  Anticoagulant  Antitussive  Aperient  Emollient  HaemolyticThe seed is analgesic, antiasthmatic, anticoagulant, antitussive, aperient, emollient and haemolytic[176]. It s used in the treatment of amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, traumatic pain due to blood stasis, constipation of aged and debilitated patients, coughs and asthma[176]. The seed contains amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.","Used as a disease-resistant low-chill rootstock for the cultivated peach, Prunus persica[183]. A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].",,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants flower very early in the year and the flowers are often damaged by late frosts[188]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200].
