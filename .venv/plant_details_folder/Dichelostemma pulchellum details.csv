A slow baking develops the sweetness of the corm[95]. The corm can be dried and ground into a powder then used as a thickener in soups or mixed with cereal flours to make bread etc[257]. The corm is usually harvested in the spring[257]. Flowers - raw[257]. A nice decoration in the salad bowl[183].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a well-drained rich sandy loam[1], it likes plenty of moisture whilst in growth followed by a warm dry period in late summer to autumn in order to fully ripen its bulb[200]. Plants are susceptible to rot in wet soils[200]. This species is hardy to between -5 to -10°c, it may require protection in severe winters[90]. This can be done by applying a good organic mulch such as dry bracken in late autumn and removing it in early spring. Alternatively, you can cover the ground with a cloche or other device. A very ornamental plant, it can flower in 2 years from seed.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a free-draining compost in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in spring in a cold frame[175]. Seedlings are prone to damping off and so should be kept well ventilated[175]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[175]. If the seed is sown thinly enough, it can be grown on for its first year without transplanting and then the dormant bulbs can be planted 2/3 to a pot. Otherwise prick out the seedlings when large enough to handle, planting them 2/3 to a pot. Grow on the plants in a greenhouse for at least two years before planting out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Division in autumn of offsets that have reached flowering size[1]. Dig up the clumps of bulbs and replant the larger ones into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up the smaller ones and grow them on for a year in a cold frame before planting them out.",
