21,Other Uses Description,"This species makes a very good wind-shelter hedge in exposed maritime positions, though it is slow growing[11, 75]. Plants can be used as a tall ground cover when planted about 1.2 metres apart each way[208]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, doing well on chalk[11, 182, 200]. Plants are very tolerant of maritime exposure[11, 49, 75] but will require staking at first if planted in an exposed area unless planted out whilst still very small[166]. Prefers a sunny position but tolerates light shade[202]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it succeeds when grown against a wall at Kew[K] and grows very well in S.W. England[11]. Established plants can tolerate temperatures down to about -15°c[184, 202] if the soil is well drained[200]. A very ornamental plant, the flowers are very attractive to wasps[1]. Plants are very tolerant of trimming and can be pruned right down to the ground if required[200]. When bruised, the leaves release a pungent smell[245]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in the greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 8 weeks at 15°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 12cm long, July/August in a frame. High percentage[78]."
