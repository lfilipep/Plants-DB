0,Eucalyptus melliodora,Yellow Box,Myrtaceae,9-11,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269].",Gentle slopes of open woodland in areas with cool wet winters and dry summers[167].,"Australia - New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Tender,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusMelliodora.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusMelliodora2.gif",,"Eucalyptus melliodora is an evergreen Tree growing to 30 m (98ft 5in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Bog Garden;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A very good fuel[167]. See user comments in the cultivation section.",,"Prefers a sunny position in a moderately fertile well-drained moisture retentive circum-neutral soil[200]. Tolerates poor and dry soils, especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. This species is unlikely to be hardy outdoors in Britain, though it might succeed in the mildest areas of the country. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions[200]. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200]. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200]. Plants are shallow-rooting and, especially in windy areas, should be planted out into their permanent positions when small to ensure that they do not suffer from wind-rock[245]. They strongly resent root disturbance and should be container grown before planting out into their permanent position[11]. Flowers are rich in nectar and are a good bee crop[200]. Some plant feedback on E. melliodora from a user in Australia. Firstly, it often grows in the company of E. camuldensis on river banks and floodplains. (more often than in the company of other species). Secondly, both of these are classic and very dependable honey species. Yellow box is probably a part of most honey blends and is common, and a widely available varietal and beekeepers everywhere know of it. For most Australians, when one speaks of yellow box, it is in terms of honey. I am sure it would be a dependable nectar producer in many climates and countries ( summer heat likely a desirable requirement- this is my personal and uninformed opinion). Also, Eucalyptus oil is undoubtedly poisonous to ingest but is also very useful. You can use it to remove enamel paints and glue off jars, I sterilize my pruning tools with it, put it into floor cleaner, etc. Wear gloves; it will dry your hands out terribly.","Seed - surface sow February/March in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11, 78, 134]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2°c[200]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in June, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
