13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Morus mongolica is a deciduous Tree growing to 7.5 m (24ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 11]. Closely allied to M. alba[1], and considered to be no more than part of that species by some botanists[200]. Mulberries have brittle roots and so need to be handled with care when planting them out[238]. Any pruning should only be carried out in the winter when the plant is fully dormant because mulberries bleed badly when cut[238]. Ideally prune only badly placed branches and dead wood[238]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species is dioecious[266]. Both male and female plants will need to be grown if fruit is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed germinates best if given 2 - 3 months cold stratification[80, 98]. Sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if possible, otherwise in February in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in the first spring, though it sometimes takes another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. A good percentage take, though they sometimes fail to thrive[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 25 - 30cm with a heel of 2 year old wood, autumn or early spring in a cold frame or a shady bed outside[78, 113, 200]. Bury the cuttings to threequarters of their depth. Layering in autumn[200].",
