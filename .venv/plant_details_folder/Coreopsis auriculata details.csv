Form: Upright or erect.","Coreopsis auriculata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Massing.An orange to red/orange dye is obtained from the flowers and stems[168]. Established plants are drought resistant[1]. Special Features: Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. The shorter cultivar Coreopsis auriculata 'Nana' (Dwarf Mouse-ear Tickseed, Lobed Tickseed 'Nana’) is a good low ground cover performing best with consistent moisture.",,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a fertile well-drained moisture retentive medium soil[111, 200]. Requires a sunny position[111, 200]. Established plants are drought resistant[1]. Plants are apt to die out overwinter if they are grown on clay soils[111]. A good bee plant[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]. The shorter cultivar Coreopsis auriculata 'Nana' (Dwarf Mouse-ear Tickseed, Lobed Tickseed 'Nana’) is useful for borders, edging, rock gardens and ground cover performing best with consistent moisture.  It spreads by stolons but is not invasive. Height: 15-30 cm  (6-12 in) Spread: 15-30 cm  (6-12 in).","Seed - sow March in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer[111]. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in mid spring. Once they are more than 15cm tall, plant the seedlings out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring. Cuttings of young basal shoots, May/June in a frame[200]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
