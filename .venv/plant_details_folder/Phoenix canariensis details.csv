The fruit are orange, 2 cm long and 1 cm diameter, with a large seed; the fruit pulp when ripe (solid black) is edible, but usually too thin to be worth eating. They are a famine food. Inflorescence buds are tapped for the sweet sap which is eaten as syrup or palm honey. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: sugar (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]."

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: SugarClimate: Mediterranean. Humidity: semi-arid. Found at elevations from sea level to 1,200m in a range of habitats, from humid areas just below cloud forest to semi-arid areas where its presence usually indicates groundwater. Cultivated in wet-winter or Mediterranean climates, but also in wet-summer or humid subtropical climates like eastern Australia and the southeastern United States. Examples in high-latitude oceanic climates, such as Ireland, the UK, and the Channel Islands. It can be cultivated where temperatures rarely fall below -10°C (14 or 10 °F). Light: Full Sun. USDA Hardiness Zone 8a: to -12.2°C (10 °F) to 11: above 4.5 °C (40 °F). Drought-tolerant; suitable for xeriscaping.  It is very frost hardy and thrives on poor soils.  It needs good drainage. Soil pH requirements: 6.1 (mildly acidic) to 7.8 (mildly alkaline). Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. Normal height range  10–20m (33–66 ft) tall; some specimens have reached 40m (130 ft)."
26,Plant Propagation,Plants are grown from seed. Seed germinates readily. It takes 1-2 months to germinate. In tropical locations suckers can be used.
