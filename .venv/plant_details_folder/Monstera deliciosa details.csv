4,Known Hazards,"All parts of the plant contain calcium oxalate crystals. This substance is toxic fresh and, if eaten, makes the mouth, tongue and throat feel as if hundreds of small needles are digging in to them. However, calcium oxalate is easily broken down either by thoroughly cooking the plant or by fully drying it and, in either of these states, it is safe to eat the plant. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet[238 ].(All parts of plant are poisonous if ingested Handling plant may cause skin irritation or allergic reaction)"

The aerial roots are used as ropes and in making baskets. Root infusion is used against arthritis. The whole plant can be toxic when consumed fresh because it contains calcium oxalate crystals which can easily be broken down by thoroughly cooking or fully drying the plant."

18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw. The juicy, subacid fruits have an excellent aroma and taste, combining the flavours of bananas and pineapples[46 , 301 ]. The fruit is eaten raw, made into jellies and jams, and is also used in ice creams, sherbets, soft drinks etc[301 , 335 ]. Some people find the fruit unpleasant to eat because it can contain irritating crystals in the pulp[335 ]. The fruit is 8 - 12mm long, held in a bunch on a spadix that can be 25cm long[200 , 301 ]. The fruiting spadices become whitish at maturity and very juicy. They are sweet and of good flavour and often are eaten, but care must be taken to eat only fruits that are thoroughly ripe, since immature ones will cause swelling and irritation of the mouth because of needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate found in the tissues or sap[331 ]."

23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The aerial roots of these plants, as well as those of some other aroids, particularly Philodendron, often attain a great length, reaching from the branches of fairly high trees almost or quite to the ground. They are much used in Guatemala for making the so-called mimbre furniture, similar to the light rattan furniture made commonly in the United States. The dried roots, of uniform diameter, or sometimes the fresh ones, are wound tightly and evenly about a wooden frame, forming handsome and durable articles of furniture[331 ]. The roots are also used to make strong baskets[331 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the hot, humid, tropical lowlands, though it can also be found at elevations up to 1,500 metres[331 , 335 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 28 - 34°c, but can tolerate 18 - 38°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -3°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,300 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Prefers growing in a shady position[302 ], but can tolerate a wide range from deep shade to fairly open and sunny[418 ]. Although it is often an epiphytic plant, it grows very well in the earth - often becoming a pest in fact because of their rapid growth and spread[331 ]. It prefers a fertile, moist, but well-drained soil[302 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. The plant forms two types of aerial roots from the nodes and internodes of the stems - one type grows down to the ground where it roots and is a source of moisture and nutrients, the other type is an anchor root, growing around the stem of the host plant[916 ]. Seedling plants can commence bearing fruit when 6 - 8 years old, plants from cuttings when 3 - 4 years old[335 ]. Plants can flower and produce fruit all year round[335 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Summer. Bloom Color: Cream/Tan. Spacing: 24-36 in. (60-90 cm)."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - must not be allowed to dry out[200 ]. Air layering. Internodal cuttings. Cuttings made from growing tips with one leaf attached.
