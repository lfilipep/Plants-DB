24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a hot dry position[166]. Requires a lime-free soil[200]. Requires a sheltered well-drained position[260]. This species is not very cold-hardy in Britain. However, plants can tolerate infrequent short-lived frosts down to about -5°c[200, 260] and can be grown outdoors in the mildest parts of the country[166]. They are growing well at Probus Gardens in Cornwall where they survived temperatures lower than -6°c in the winter of 1995 - 6[K]. The leaves have large, viciously hooked spines[260]. Is the plant monocarpic[1]? A self-sterile species, it is pollinated by birds in the wild. In cultivation, cross-pollination with P. alpestris can be effective[260]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of offsets in the spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer."
