It requires some protection such as a warm wall when grown outdoors in Britain[200]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188]. The flowers are slightly scented[245]. Plants produce suckers and these can sometimes be invasive[202]. Pruning can be carried out in early to mid spring. Removing one third of the oldest growth down to ground level rejuvenates the plant and encourages greater flowering[202]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.
