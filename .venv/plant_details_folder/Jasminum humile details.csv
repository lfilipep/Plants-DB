24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a good well-drained loam in a sunny position[1, 200]. Tolerates light shade[202]. Tolerates most soil types, including dry soils once it is established[202]. This species is not very cold hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. It requires some protection such as a warm wall when grown outdoors in Britain[200]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188]. The flowers are slightly scented[245]. Plants produce suckers and these can sometimes be invasive[202]. Pruning can be carried out in early to mid spring. Removing one third of the oldest growth down to ground level rejuvenates the plant and encourages greater flowering[202]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy. Cuttings of mature wood in November. Layering."
