It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,"Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Aromatic  Diaphoretic  Laxative  Malaria  Stimulant  TonicA tea made from the bark is antiperiodic, aromatic, mildly diaphoretic, laxative, stimulant, tonic[4, 222]. It has historically been used as a substitute for quinine in the treatment of malaria[222]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of stomach ache and cramps[257]. The bark has been chewed by people trying to break the tobacco habit[222]. A hot infusion of the bark has been snuffed to treat sinus problems and has also been held in the mouth to treat toothaches[257]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238]. It does not store well so stocks should be renewed annually[238]. A tea made from the fruit is a tonic, used in the treatment of general debility and was formerly esteemed in the treatment of stomach ailments[222].","Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The roots are very disease-resistant and are used as a rootstock for less vigorous species[226].  - finely grained, soft, light, durable, not strong[4, 46, 61, 82, 171, 229, 235]. It weighs 29lb per cubic foot[235]. It takes a very good polish and is used for boxes, crates, flooring, cabinet making etc[4, 46, 61, 171, 229].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Best grown in a warm position in a moderately rich free soil of an open texture[1]. Tolerates limey soils[200] so long as they are deep and rich in humus[188]. The branches are brittle and so a sheltered position is required[200]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. Plants are hardy to about -28°c[200]. A fairly fast-growing tree, it takes about 25 - 30 years before it first produces flowers and lives about 125 - 150 years in the wild[229]. The sub-species M. acuminata cordata begins flowering at an earlier age[245]. Good seed crops are produced about every 3 - 5 years[229]. The flowers have a delicate perfume[245]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
