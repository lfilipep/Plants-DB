A hot infusion of the bark has been snuffed to treat sinus problems and has also been held in the mouth to treat toothaches[257]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238].

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Best grown in a warm position in a moderately rich free soil of an open texture[1]. Tolerates limey soils[200] so long as they are deep and rich in humus[188]. The branches are brittle and so a sheltered position is required[200]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. Plants are hardy to about -28°c[200]. A fairly fast-growing tree, it takes about 25 - 30 years before it first produces flowers and lives about 125 - 150 years in the wild[229]. The sub-species M. acuminata cordata begins flowering at an earlier age[245]. Good seed crops are produced about every 3 - 5 years[229]. The flowers have a delicate perfume[245]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200]."
