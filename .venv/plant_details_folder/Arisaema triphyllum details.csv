19,Edible Uses Description,"Tuber - it must be thoroughly dried or cooked before being eaten[2, 21, 55, 57, 95, 102]. The roots can be cut into very thin slices and allowed to dry for several months, after which they are eaten like potato chips, crumbled to make a cereal or ground into a cocoa-flavoured powder for making biscuits, cakes etc[177, 183]. They can also be pounded into a powder, this is thern left to dry for several weeks when it becomes safe to use[213]. The root is up to 5cm long and 2cm wide[4]. Caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Acrid: Causes heat and irritation when applied to the skin.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Contraceptive: Prevents fertilization occurring in females.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Irritant: Causes irritation or abnormal sensitivity in living tissue.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Acrid  Antirheumatic  Antiseptic  Contraceptive  Diaphoretic  Expectorant  Irritant  Poultice  StimulantThe root is acrid, antiseptic, diaphoretic, expectorant, irritant and stimulant[21, 46, 222, 238, 257]. It is harvested in early spring and dried for later use[4]. The fresh root is considered to be too dangerous and intensely acrid to use, whilst the dried roots become inactive, so fresh, partially dried roots are used[213]. Due to the potentially toxic nature of this plant, it should only be used internally under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[K]. The root was applied as a poultice on headaches, scrofulous sores, rheumatism, boils, abscesses and ringworm[222, 257]. A decoction of the root has been used as a wash for sore eyes[257]. The root was used as a contraceptive by the N. American Indians. One teaspoonful of the dried powdered root in cold water was said to prevent conception for a week whilst two teaspoonfuls in hot water was said to induce permanent sterility[213].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Massing, Woodland garden. Prefers a cool peaty soil in the bog garden, woodland garden or a sheltered border in semi-shade[90, 134, 200]. Prefers a loamy or peaty soil and will tolerate a sunny position if the soil is moist but not water-logged and the position is not too hot or exposed[1, 200]. Tubers should be planted about 10cm deep[233]. Only plant out full sized tubers and mulch them with organic matter in the winter[200]. Plants need protection from slugs[200]. Most species in this genus are dioecious, but they are sometimes monoecious and can also change sex from year to year.  Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Wetlands plant.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a cold frame[134]. Stored seed remains viable for at least a year and can be sown in spring in the greenhouse but it will probably require a period of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least a coupe of years until the corms are more than 20mm in diameter. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst they are dormant. Division of tubers when the plant dies down in late summer.",
