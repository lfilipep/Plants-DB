23,Other Uses Description,"The latex obtained from the roots could be used in making rubber[46, 61, 161, 177]. Unfortunately it is not produced in sufficient quantity to make commercial extraction worthwhile[K]. A green dye is obtained from the bark[168]. A yellow-gold dye is obtained from the flowers[168, 257]. It is orange when alum is used as a mordant[257]. It rapidly establishes in disturbed habitat, including burns, flooded washes, and rockslides, so it is a valuable shrub for revegetating damaged land such as overgrazed rangeland and abandoned mining areas.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position and prefers a well-drained sandy soil[1, 11]. Plants do not require a rich soil[11]. They tolerate alkaline soils[200]. A very hardy plant but it prefers a drier climate than it finds in Britain though it succeeds in this country if given the protection of a dry sunny wall[200]. A very variable and ornamental species[60]. The leaves and stems are pleasantly aromatic[219].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse and only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200].",
