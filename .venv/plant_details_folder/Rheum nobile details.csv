0,Rheum nobile,Sikkim Rhubarb,Polygonaceae,6-9,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves of some if not all members of this genus contain significant quantities of oxalic acid and should not be eaten in any quantity. Oxalic acid can lock up certain minerals in the body, especially calcium, leading to nutritional deficiency. The content of oxalic acid will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",Rock ledges around 4000 metres[187].

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,,"Leaf stem - raw or cooked[51, 105, 183, 272]. Pleasantly acid, this is a commonly used vegetable where it grows wild[2, 183].","Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  Astringent  Carminative  Depurative  Diuretic  LaxativeThe root is astringent, carminative, depurative, diuretic, purgative and tonic[51, 91, 240]. Small doses act as an astringent tonic to the digestive system, whilst larger doses act as a mild laxative[232]. The flowering stem is used in Tibetan medicine, it is said to have a sour taste and a heating potency[241]. It is antiemetic, diuretic and laxative[241]. It is used in the treatment of swellings and fullness of the abdomen as well as to rid the body of retained fluids[241].",,An ornamental plant[1] hardy to about -15°c.,,"Prefers a deep, fertile, moderately heavy, humus rich, moisture retentive, well-drained soil in sun or semi-shade. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -15°c[200]. Plants have proved very difficult to grow in cultivation in Britain[187]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200].","Seed - best sown in autumn in a shaded cold frame[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in the spring. Division in early spring or autumn[1, 111]. Divide up the rootstock with a sharp spade or knife, making sure that there is at least one growth bud on each division. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
