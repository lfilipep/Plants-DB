17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anticonvulsant: used to control (prevent) seizures (convulsions),Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Epilepsy: Used in the treatment of Epilepsy - a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Nervine: Stimulates and calms the nerves.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticonvulsant  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Epilepsy  Miscellany  Nervine  Sedative  TonicA commonly used herbal medicine, Virginian skullcap is a very effective nervine that has traditionally been used in the treatment of a wide range of nervous conditions. Its tonic and restorative properties help to support and nourish the nervous system, calming and relieving stress and anxiety[222, 238, 244, 254]. Very little research has been carried out on this species, despite its long use in American and British herbal medicine[244]. Research is sorely needed, and may reveal more uses for this valuable herb[254]. The leaves are antispasmodic, slightly astringent, diuretic, nervine, sedative and strongly tonic[4, 21, 46, 165]. They are harvested in early summer and dried for later use[4]. It is used in the treatment of various problems of the nervous system including epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety, delirium tremens, withdrawal from barbiturates and tranquillisers, and neuralgia[222, 238, 244]. An infusion of the plant has been used to promote suppressed menstruation, relieve breast pain and encourage expulsion of the placenta[213, 254], it should not be given to pregnant women since it can induce a miscarriage[238]. This plant should be used with some caution since in excess it causes giddiness, stupor, confusion and twitching[238]. The plant was once believed of use in the treatment of rabies, though there is no evidence to support this[207, 213]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sunny position in any ordinary garden soil that does not dry out during the growing season[200]. Plants are not so long-lived when grown in rich soils[4]. Many of the plants grown under this name in gardens are in fact S. altissima[238]. It is important to ensure you have the correct plant if using it medicinally[238]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ outdoors in late spring. If there is only a small quantity of seed it is better to sow it in a pot in a cold frame in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the spring. Division in spring just before new growth begins. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Basal cuttings in early summer in a frame. Very easy. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
