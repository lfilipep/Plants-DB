Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticonvulsant  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Epilepsy  Miscellany  Nervine  Sedative  TonicA commonly used herbal medicine, Virginian skullcap is a very effective nervine that has traditionally been used in the treatment of a wide range of nervous conditions. Its tonic and restorative properties help to support and nourish the nervous system, calming and relieving stress and anxiety[222, 238, 244, 254]. Very little research has been carried out on this species, despite its long use in American and British herbal medicine[244]. Research is sorely needed, and may reveal more uses for this valuable herb[254]. The leaves are antispasmodic, slightly astringent, diuretic, nervine, sedative and strongly tonic[4, 21, 46, 165]. They are harvested in early summer and dried for later use[4]. It is used in the treatment of various problems of the nervous system including epilepsy, insomnia, anxiety, delirium tremens, withdrawal from barbiturates and tranquillisers, and neuralgia[222, 238, 244]. An infusion of the plant has been used to promote suppressed menstruation, relieve breast pain and encourage expulsion of the placenta[213, 254], it should not be given to pregnant women since it can induce a miscarriage[238]. This plant should be used with some caution since in excess it causes giddiness, stupor, confusion and twitching[238]. The plant was once believed of use in the treatment of rabies, though there is no evidence to support this[207, 213].",Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,None known,,"Succeeds in a sunny position in any ordinary garden soil that does not dry out during the growing season[200]. Plants are not so long-lived when grown in rich soils[4]. Many of the plants grown under this name in gardens are in fact S. altissima[238]. It is important to ensure you have the correct plant if using it medicinally[238]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow in situ outdoors in late spring. If there is only a small quantity of seed it is better to sow it in a pot in a cold frame in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the spring. Division in spring just before new growth begins. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Basal cuttings in early summer in a frame. Very easy. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
