25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information for this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in at least the milder areas of the country.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed will require 1 - 2 months stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame. Layering in early spring.",
