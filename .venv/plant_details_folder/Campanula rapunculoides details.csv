See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",,"Leaves and young shoots - raw or cooked[85, 177]. Rich in vitamin C. A pleasant mild flavour[K]. Root - raw or cooked[2, 105, 177]. A nut-like flavour, very palatable[85]. The young roots are best[85]. Somewhat sweet, they are a pleasant addition to the salad bowl[183].",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Vitamin CThe plant has been used as a cure for hydrophobia in Russia[271].,,None known,,"An easily grown plant succeeding in almost any soil[221], though it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. It is slower growing and less spreading when grown in heavier soils[271]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A beautiful plant, it was at one time cultivated as a culinary plant but has fallen into disuse[4]. The plant produces a mass of thick white roots which can spread at an alarming rate, especially in light soils. It can often fill an entire bed with its tenaceous roots, killing off less vigorous plants[271]. It is best grown in the wild garden where it can be allowed to romp without harm[221, 271]. Plants can also succeed when growing in thin grass[233]. Plants produce seed freely and often self-sow[221]. Slugs are very attracted to this plant, we have had great problems growing it on our Cornish trial grounds because the slugs eat out all the new shoots in spring and can kill even well-established specimens[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. Easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[200]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, any part of the root will produce a new plant[221].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
