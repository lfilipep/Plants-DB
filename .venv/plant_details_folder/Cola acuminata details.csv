It can be chewed or ground into a powder and made into a drink in order to give energy, increase alertness, retard hunger and fatigue, aid digestion and increase stamina[ 301 ]. When the whole nuts are chewed, they taste bitter at first but they leave a sweet taste in the mouth later that affects other foods or drinks that are consumed[ 301 ]. Thus chewing cola nuts before drinking water helps to render the water sweeter[ 303 ]. The bitter tasting seeds are much appreciated by Muslims in the drier region of West Africa, especially during the month of Ramadan[ 303 ]. The nuts are used for non-alcoholic soft drinks like Coca-Cola[ 303 ]. An extract, prepared from the dried kernels, is used to flavour carbonated drinks, ice cream, candy, baked goods etc[ 301 ]. The kernels can be red, white or pink[ 301 ]. The red ones can be used as a natural food colorant[ 301 ].",

The crushed nuts are boiled together with the leaves of Morinda lucida and the liquid taken internally to cure piles[ 303 ]. The nuts ground to a fine paste together with the leaves of Scoparia dulce, are dissolved in a little water and a few drops are administered orally to babies for headache[ 303 ].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Cola needs a hot humid climate, with a mean annual temperature in the range of 26° - 35°c, and a mean annual rainfall of 1,200 - 1,800mm[ 303 ]. However, it can withstand a dry season on sites with a high groundwater level and it may be cultivated in drier areas where groundwater is available[ 303 ]. Though it is a lowland forest tree it has also been found at altitudes over 300 metres on deep rich soils under heavy and evenly distributed rainfall[ 303 ]. Prefers a minimum temperature no lower than 13°c[ 238 ]. Prefers deep, rich, well-drained soil[ 303 , 307 ], although it may also be found in marshy areas[ 303 ]. Does well in both light and heavy soils[ 303 ]. Intolerant of soils with a high pH[ 335 ]. Cola grows naturally in the shade, but it develops a better spreading crown which yields more fruits when grown in open places[ 303 ]. Trees start producing at around the age of 12 - 15 years and can produce 10 - 16 kilos of seed annually for more than 80 years[ 238 ]. Trees commence flowering and fruiting when they are small[ 307 ]. Yields of 300 nuts per mature tree are considered good[ 303 ]. Plants are often used as shade trees for cocoa (Theobroma cacao) plantations[ 238 ]. Muslims consider the cola nut as sacred and brought by the prophet Mohammed. They use the nut for ceremonial and social occasions[ 303 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow individually in containers[ 200 ]. The seedlings are sometimes raised in pots or in polythene bags before planting out[ 303 ]. Ripe fruits harvested before the follicles split open, the seeds or nuts are extracted from the follicles and the white aril removed after 5 days of fermentation. Nuts for planting are the mature ones that have undergone after-ripening[ 303 ]. Cuttings of mature wood[ 200 ]. Aerial layering.",
