It is considered the strongest fish poison in South-East Asia[303 ]. The leaves are said to be poisonous enough to kill cattle[418 ].","Forest edges, roadsides and along rivers, usually at low elevations but up to 1,500 metres in Java[303 ].

There is no known edible uses of Derris but it has several medicinal uses. It is used traditionally to eliminate microorganisms that cause diseases. It is applied to abscesses and used in the treatment of leprosy. It is sometimes used to cause abortion and increase menstrual flow in women. The root contains a toxic substance known as Rotenone, which is used as an insecticide.","Paraderris elliptica is a CLIMBER growing to 16 m (52ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Deguelia elliptica (Roxb.) Taub.

The roots are used as emmenagogue[303 ]. The stems are a blood tonic[303 ]. Rotenone, the active insecticidal ingredient found mainly in the root, has been evaluated as a potential antitumor agent[303 ]. It is broadly cytotoxic, the growth-inhibiting effect has been demonstrated both with cultured cells and experimental tumours[303 ]. The roots also contain tubaic acid (0.01% of air-dried root). This compound has shown anti-microbial activity, inhibiting the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at high concentrations[303 ].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.","The powdered root is widely used as an insecticide[303 ]. It is effective against a range of horticultural pests, such as aphids and caterpillars, and also against external body parasites like ticks, lice, fleas and flies[418 ]. The root can be up to 2cm in diameter and more than 2 metres long[418 ].",,"A plant mainly found in humid, lowland tropical areas, though it can also be grown at elevations up to 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 20 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 3,500mm, but tolerates 1,400 - 5,000mm[418 ]. It can survive dry periods of up to 4 months[418 ]. Prefers a position in full sun or in light shade[418 ]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils of at least moderate fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.3 - 8.6[418 ]. Plants can commence flowering when about 18 months old[303 ]. The yield of dried roots is 1,100 - 1,800 kg/ha, occasionally up to 3,000 kg/ha, particularly when plants are trellised[303 ]. There is a danger of soil erosion during the first few months after planting and again after harvesting, therefore land suitable for this crop should either be flat or only slightly sloping[418 ]. Several cultivars (mostly clones of this vegetatively propagated crop) are widespread in cultivation and have bean selected for high rotenone content (13% of the roots)[317 ].",Seed -,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
