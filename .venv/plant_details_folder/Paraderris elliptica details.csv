13,Summary,"Derris, Paraderris elliptica, is an evergreen climbing shrub with woody stems that grow up to 16m long and commonly found in East Asia. There is no known edible uses of Derris but it has several medicinal uses. It is used traditionally to eliminate microorganisms that cause diseases. It is applied to abscesses and used in the treatment of leprosy. It is sometimes used to cause abortion and increase menstrual flow in women. The root contains a toxic substance known as Rotenone, which is used as an insecticide.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Paraderris elliptica is a CLIMBER growing to 16 m (52ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Blood tonic: Is this any different to a blood purifier?,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Leprosy: Used to treat leprosy - a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and superficial nerves (in the skin) caused by Mycobacterium leprae.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antiseptic  Antitumor  Blood tonic  Emmenagogue  Leprosy  ParasiticideThe plant is traditionally used for antisepsis and is applied to abscesses and against leprosy and itch, and sometimes as an abortifacient[303 ]. The roots are used as emmenagogue[303 ]. The stems are a blood tonic[303 ]. Rotenone, the active insecticidal ingredient found mainly in the root, has been evaluated as a potential antitumor agent[303 ]. It is broadly cytotoxic, the growth-inhibiting effect has been demonstrated both with cultured cells and experimental tumours[303 ]. The roots also contain tubaic acid (0.01% of air-dried root). This compound has shown anti-microbial activity, inhibiting the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at high concentrations[303 ].",
20,Other Uses,"Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The powdered root is widely used as an insecticide[303 ]. It is effective against a range of horticultural pests, such as aphids and caterpillars, and also against external body parasites like ticks, lice, fleas and flies[418 ]. The root can be up to 2cm in diameter and more than 2 metres long[418 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant mainly found in humid, lowland tropical areas, though it can also be grown at elevations up to 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 20 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 3,500mm, but tolerates 1,400 - 5,000mm[418 ]. It can survive dry periods of up to 4 months[418 ]. Prefers a position in full sun or in light shade[418 ]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils of at least moderate fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.3 - 8.6[418 ]. Plants can commence flowering when about 18 months old[303 ]. The yield of dried roots is 1,100 - 1,800 kg/ha, occasionally up to 3,000 kg/ha, particularly when plants are trellised[303 ]. There is a danger of soil erosion during the first few months after planting and again after harvesting, therefore land suitable for this crop should either be flat or only slightly sloping[418 ]. Several cultivars (mostly clones of this vegetatively propagated crop) are widespread in cultivation and have bean selected for high rotenone content (13% of the roots)[317 ].",
