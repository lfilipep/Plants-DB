0,Dryopteris carthusiana,"Narrow Buckler Fern, Spinulose woodfern",Dryopteridaceae,6-8,"Although we have found no reports for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. The fresh plant contains thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]. However, there have been reports for other species of ferns suggesting that even cooked fronds can have a long term harmful effect. Some caution is therefore advised.","Damp and wet woods, marshes and wet heaths[17].","Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to Spain and Siberia. N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",D. spinulosum. Watt.

Some caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity. Old leafstalks on the underground stems can be roasted, peeled and the inner portion eaten[257]. Young curled fronds, harvested as they are developing in the spring, can be boiled and eaten like asparagus[257].",Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.VermifugeThe root contains ‘filicin’, a substance that paralyses tapeworms and other internal parasites and has been used as a worm expellent[4, 222, 238]. It is one of the most effective treatments known for tapeworms - its use should be immediately followed by a non-oily purgative such as magnesium sulphate in order to expel the worms from the body[238]. An oily purge, such as caster oil, increases the absorption of the fern root and can be dangerous[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and can be dried for later use, it should not be stored for longer than 12 months[238]. This remedy should be used with caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The root is toxic and the dosage is critical[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity.",,"When spaced about 30cm apart each way, the plants can be grown as a ground cover[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Woodland garden. Prefers an acid to neutral soil, succeeding in ordinary fertile soil in a shady position[175, 200]. Requires permanently moist conditions at its roots. A very ornamental plant[1], it is often evergreen in mild winters[188]. Plants spread slowly at the rootstock[233]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, There are no flowers or blooms.","Spores - can be sown at any time of the year in a greenhouse. Surface sow on a sterilised compost and keep moist, possibly by placing the pot in a plastic bag. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c. Pot up small clumps of the plants when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a shady part of the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Division in spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
