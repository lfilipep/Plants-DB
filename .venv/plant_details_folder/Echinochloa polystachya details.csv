13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Echinochloa polystachya is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can grow in water.",

21,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  New CropClimate: warm temperate to tropical. Humidity: humid. Tolerates a wide range of soil fertility, but prefers soils of medium to high fertility.  Grows in clay soils.  It is adapted to soil pH 4.0–8.0 and has some resistance to sodicity .  Very tolerant of poor drainage. Its natural habitat is seasonally flooded wetlands, but can grow under very high rainfall (>1,900 mm) conditions.  Generally no growth under dry conditions unless there is a high water table, but re-establishes from stems and stolons with subsequent flooding.  Normally grown in water to 1 m depth but can persist for short periods in deeper water to 3 m.  Grows best in wet or seasonally flooded areas, where flooding can occur for 7–12 months of the year. No frost tolerance. Full sunlight [415]. Aleman grass is a high yielding species with average DM yields of 8-12 t/ha in South America and 10-20 t/ha in Australia. It was reported to yield as much as 99 tons DM/ha in Brazil. In Australia, it has been introduced to enhance the productivity of Para grass stands. In India it was reported to yield much higher green biomass, dry matter and crude protein than Para grass. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: hay. (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Aleman grass spreads vegetatively when broken stems, runners and roots are moved in water.",
