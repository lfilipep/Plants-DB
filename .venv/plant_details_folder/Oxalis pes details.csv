This species is not very cold-hardy in Britain, though it is naturalized in parts of south-western England[1, 17]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[90]. Plants spread rapidly when in a suitable environment and can quite easily become a weed in virtually frost-free environments[200, 260]. Plants seldom produce seed in Europe but they spread by means of asexually produced bulbils[200].",Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
