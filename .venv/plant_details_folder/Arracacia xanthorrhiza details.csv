It grows up to 1 m tall. It is commonly cultivated in small scale operations for its edible starchy roots. The tuber is cooked and is considered as a staple food in some parts of South America, usually as a potato substitute. It is also a good source of starch. The leaves are used as a flavouring, or eaten either raw or cooked and mixed in salads. The stems are as well cooked and eaten as vegetables.","Arracacia xanthorrhiza is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile. Suitable for: medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. esculenta. Conium arracacia.,Cultivated Beds; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Tuber - cooked[ 22 , 46 , 61 , 97 , 171 ]. Both long and fine roots and edible, tuberous and fusiform roots emerge from the stem[ 418 ]. Very palatable and easily digested[ 1 , 196 ], the root is used as a staple food in some parts of S. America[ 2 ]. The root contains 10 - 25% starch, it is high in calcium and vitamin A[ 196 ]. It is used as a potato substitute, its flavour is between that of parsnips and sweet chestnuts with a hint of sweetness[ 2 , 183 ]. The sweetness increases in storage[ 196 ]. The root is also used as the source of starch used in other foods[ 183 ]. The roots can be 5 - 25cm long and up to 8cm in diameter[ 418 ]. The roots are harvested in the autumn and have a relatively short storage life[ 196 ]. Leaves. Used as a flavouring[ 177 ]. The leaves are used in the same way as celery in raw or cooked salads[ 418 ]. Young stems - raw or cooked as a vegetable[ 183 , 196 ]. The stems are sometimes blanched and used like celery in salads[ 196 , 301 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 14 - 21°c, but can tolerate 10 - 28°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 800 - 1,200mm, but tolerates 600 - 1,800mm[ 418 ]. Requires a sunny position[ 418 ]. Prefers a good loam. Grows best in a well-drained sandy loam with a pH in the range of 5 to 6[ 196 , 300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 6.5. Plants take about 120 - 240 days from planting to produce a first crop and 300 - 400 days to produce a crop of mature tubers[ 196 ]. At harvest time there can be as many as 10 tubers each the size of a carrot formed around the central root196]. One plant can yield 2 - 3 kg of edible roots, total yields of 40 tonnes per hectare are possible[ 196 ]. Preventing the plant from flowering can increase yields[ 196 ]. Plants might be sensitive to daylength, possibly requiring short days to initiate tuber production, and so may not be suitable for temperate climates[ 196 , 300 ]. They also have a longer growing season than potatoes and are frost-tender so need a relatively long growing season[ 196 ]. Plants do not always produce viable seed in S. America[ 196 ].","Seed - sow in a seedbed or containers and only just cover the seed. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination is often poor, less than 50%[ 196 ]. Since this species is believed to be a hybrid it will probably not breed true from seed. Plant out when about 10cm tall. Division. The plant forms a clump of tubers around a central root, each tuber can be used to grow a new plant. Traditionally the base of the tuber is repeatedly slashed to stimulate shoots to form and encourage a uniform arrangement of lateral roots. They are then left for a few days to heal before planting them out[ 196 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
