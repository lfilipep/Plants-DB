24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very well-drained light sandy soil in a warm sunny position[200]. Prefers a rich soil[1]. Plants can be killed by excessive winter wet[200]. This species is rather variable with a number of sub-species and cultivars of differing hardiness[200, 260]. The hardiest forms tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c[260] and can be grown outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, though they are probably best grown in a cold greenhouse. When grown outdoors, the top growth will be cut back to the ground in cold winters but, if the roots are given a good mulch in the autumn, plants will often survive the winter outdoors and resprout freely from the base in the spring[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees, providing a good source of nectar[61]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. In areas where the plant is towards the limits of its hardiness, it is best to grow the plants on in a greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood succeed at almost any time in the growing season[200]."
