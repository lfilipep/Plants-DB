13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Betula ermanii is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.",

20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseborrheic: Used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseborrheic  VulneraryVulnerary. The bark is used to bandage wounds[61].,
22,Other Uses,"Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The tree colonizes poor soils and cleared woodlands in the wild[11]. This makes it suitable for use as a pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands. It is a quite short-lived species, but grows fairly quickly and creates suitable conditions for more permanent trees to become established. Because its seedlings do not grow well in shady conditions, the birch is eventually out-competed by the other woodland trees.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained loamy soil in a sheltered position[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes wet soils[200]. Shade tolerant[200]. A very polymorphic species[58], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[50]. The young growth in spring is subject to damage by late frosts[1]. A colonizer of poor soils and cleared woodlands, it tolerates very poor soils[11]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a light position in a cold frame[78, 80, 113, 134]. Only just cover the seed and place the pot in a sunny position[78, 80, 134]. Spring sown seed should be surface sown in a sunny position in a cold frame[113, 134]. If the germination is poor, raising the temperature by covering the seed with glass can help[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If you have sufficient seed, it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed, either as soon as it is ripe or in the early spring - do not cover the spring sown seed. Grow the plants on in the seedbed for 2 years before planting them out into their permanent positions in the winter[78, 80, 113, 134].",
