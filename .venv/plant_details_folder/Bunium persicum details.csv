It is likely to prefer a well-drained light to medium soil in sun or light shade."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn."
