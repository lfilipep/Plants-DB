It is equal in quality to D. papyracea and D. bholua[146].,,We have very little information on this species and doubt that it will be hardy in Britain. A good sandy loam suits most members of this genus[11]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. According to one report the correct name for this species is Eriosolena involucrata[109].,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in spring after the last expected frosts.
