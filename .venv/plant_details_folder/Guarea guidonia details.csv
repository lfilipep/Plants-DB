17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antiasthmatic  Cardiac  Emetic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Haemostatic  Purgative  StypticA decoction of the whole, crushed plant is drunk as a treatment for angina, asthma and dyspnoea[348 ]. The resin obtained from the leaves and the stem, as well as the pulverised bark, is used locally as styptic[317 ]. The stem bark is emetic (in larger doses), expectorant, haemostatic and purgative[46 , 317 , 348 ]. A decoction is used to induce vomiting and to treat infant's thrush[348 ]. Applied externally, the powdered bark is used as a haemostatic to stem bleeding[46 ]. The liquid obtained from the rasped bark is rubbed onto skin in order to relieve body aches[348 ]. The boiled leaves are used as an emetic[348 ]. The bark contains the alkaloid rusbyine[46 ]. A juice obtained from the roots and stems is abortifacient, emmenagogue, purgative and violently emetic[348 ]. The juice is a corrosive poison which can be counteracted by an infusion of buds of Jatropha curcas[348 ]. Extracts of the bark and wood contain beta-sitosterol[348 ]. The seed contains angustinolide, a tetranotriterpenoid[348 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is cultivated in an agroforestry system on Haiti together with coffee, bananas and other species[317 ]. In Puerto Rico it is considered to give too dense a shade for growing with coffee[447 ]. Other Uses: A reddish Sandal oil is obtained from the wood[46 ]. (refers to G. trichilioides, a synonym of this species.) The very attractive heartwood is pinkish to red, turning light reddiish brown; the sapwood is whitish to brownish. The texture is medium, grain is straight; aromatic when green though odourless when seasoned. The wood is of medium weight to moderately heavy; hard; strong; tough; elastic to somewhat brittle; and very durable, even when in wet ground, with resistance to attack by dry-wood termites. Rate of air-seasoning is slow, and amount of degrade is moderate. Machining characteristics are as follows: planing, shaping, turning, mortising, and resistance to screw splitting are good; boring is fair; and sanding is excellent. This pretty wood makes fine furniture and cabinets, since it resembles mahogany and Spanish-cedar and takes a high polish. It is used also for construction, internal works, window frames, carpentry, implements, cooperage etc[46 , 333 , 419 , 447 ]. The wood is a favoured fuel because it splits easily[922 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position[419 ]. Newly planted young trees are fairly slow-growing[419 ]. Plants can flower and produce fruit for most of the year[447 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer Mid Summer Late Summer/Early Fall. Bloom Color: White/Near White. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out, nor should the aril surrounding the seed be removed[419 ]. Sow the seed as soon as it is harvested in a lightly shaded position, either in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. Germination rates are usually low, with the seed sprouting within 30 - 50 days[419 ].",
