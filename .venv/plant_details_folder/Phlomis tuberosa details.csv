Hardy to at least -15°c[200], if the top growth is killed back by the cold the plants will usually regrow. Another report says that it is hardy to about -25°c but is totally deciduous in the winter[187].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. The seed germinates quickly, prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for their first year in a greenhouse. Plant them out in early summer. Division of the tubers in spring or autumn[200]. Be careful not to damage the tubers[200]. If dividing in the autumn, it is best to store the tubers in a cool but frost-free place over the winter, planting them out in the spring. Spring divisions can be planted out straight away into their permanent positions.",
