0,Ilex verticillata,"Winterberry, Common winterberry",Aquifoliaceae,3-7,"Although no specific reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, the fruits of at least some members of this genus contain saponins and are slightly toxic. They can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and stupor if eaten in quantity[274]. The fruit is poisonous[177].","Swamps, pond margins and damp thickets[43].",Eastern N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Prinos verticillata.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Bog Garden;,,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","A tea is made from the dried and crumbled leaves[161, 177]. It does not contain caffeine[183].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Astringent  Cathartic  Malaria  Skin  TonicThe bark is antiseptic, astringent, cathartic and tonic[4, 238]. A decoction is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, malaria etc, and externally in the treatment of indolent sores and chronic skin disease[4, 238]. The bark contains about 4.8% tannin[4]. It is harvested in the autumn before the first frosts[4]. Another report says that the bark is harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238]. The fruit is cathartic[4].",,None known,,"Succeeds in most soils so long as they are not water-logged[200]. This species tolerates wetter conditions than most members of the genus[238]. A very ornamental and cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -35°c[184]. A slow-growing tree in the wild[229]. A number of named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[182]. Flowers are produced on the current year's growth[229]. The plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back into old wood if required[188]. Unlike most members of the genus, this species produces suckers[200]. Resents root disturbance, especially as the plants get older[11]. It is best to place the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, perhaps giving some winter protection for their first year or two[K]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It can take 18 months to germinate. Stored seed generally requires two winters and a summer before it will germinate and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. Scarification, followed by a warm stratification and then a cold stratification may speed up the germination time[78, 80]. The seedlings are rather slow-growing. Pot them up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame for their first year. It is possible to plant them out into a nursery bed in late spring of the following year, but they should not be left here for more than two years since they do not like being transplanted. Alternatively, grow them on in their pots for a second season and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them a good mulch and some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of almost ripe wood with a heel, August in a shaded position in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months before potting up. Layering in October. Takes 2 years[78].
