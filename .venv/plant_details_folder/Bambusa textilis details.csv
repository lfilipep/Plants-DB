Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Straw: For drinking with.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. : bank. Other Systems: strip intercrop, multistrata. Good hedging/screening in full sun to part shade. Tolerates rigorous pruning of tops to 1m. Tight footprint to 1m. A good specimen plant. Good for pots.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: Multistrata  Other Systems: Strip intercropA clumping non-invasive bamboo. Climate: warm temperate to tropical. Humidity: humid. Both hardy and drought resistant once established and tolerates sandy soils, winds and light frosts. Tolerates rigorous pruning of tops to 1m. Tight footprint to 1m. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: managed multistem (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. .",
