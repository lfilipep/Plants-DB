24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on the cultivation needs of this plant and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. Judging by its native range it is likely to succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. From its native habitat it is assumed that the plant is fairly tolerant of soil conditions, probably preferring sunny conditions."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Alternatively, sow it in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting out in late spring of the following year. Division may be possible in spring or autumn."
