See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from March to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",B. ligulata. Megasea ciliata. Saxifraga ciliata.

Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Lithontripic  Ophthalmic  Poultice  Tonic  UrinaryA juice or powder of the whole plant is used to treat urinary troubles in Nepal[272]. The juice of the leaves is used as drops to relieve earaches[272]. The root is used as a tonic in the treatment of fevers, diarrhoea and pulmonary affections[218, 240, 243]. The root juice is used to treat coughs and colds, haemorrhoids, asthma and urinary problems[272]. Externally, the root is bruised and applied as a poultice to boils and ophthalmia, it is also considered helpful in relieving backache[243, 272]. The root of this plant has a high reputation in indigenous systems of medicine for dissolving stones in the kidneys[240].","Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","The root contains 14 - 16% tannin[272]. A good ground cover plant[188], forming a slowly spreading clump[208, 233].",,"Succeeds in full sun or light shade in most soils[200] but prefers a deep fertile soil that does not dry out fully[134]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are at their best in a medium-heavy soil[208]. Succeeds in shade or semi-shade-[187]. The leaf colour is best when plants are grown in a poor soil in a sunny position[188]. Dislikes cold winds[197]. The plant is hardy to about -20°c, but the flowers and young leaves are rather sensitive to frost[187] so it is best to choose a position with shade from the early morning sun. This species is only hardy in sheltered gardens of south and west Britain[208]. If the leaves are cut back by frost then they are soon replaced by fresh leaves in the spring[188]. The roots of this plant are commonly collected from the wild for medicinal purposes. Overcollection in many areas of its range are a cause for conservation concern[272]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The different species of this genus will hybridise freely when grown near each other[233].","Seed - surface sow in a greenhouse. Make sure that the compost does not dry out. Two weeks cold stratification can speed up germination which usually takes 1 - 6 months at 15°c[134]. Fresh seed, sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring is liable to germinate better than stored seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in late spring after flowering[188] or in autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
