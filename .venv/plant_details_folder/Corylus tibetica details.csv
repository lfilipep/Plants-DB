See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",C. ferox tibetica.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[63, 105, 146, 177]. Rich in oil. The seed, in its shell, is about 10 - 15mm in diameter[266]. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. An upright growing tree that does not produce suckers[183]. This species is closely related to C. ferox[11, 200]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
