18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - cooked[200]. Sweet and fleshy, it is a delicious staple food and is also very nutritious providing a rich source of vitamins and minerals[200, K]. There are cultivars with soft, moist flesh and also forms with a more dry flesh[200]. There are also less sweet cultivars, bred for industrial production of starch[200]. In order for the roots to store through the winter, they need to be cured in the sunshine at temperatures around 25°c fr about a week before being stored at around 14°c[264]. Young shoot tips[264]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel."
23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Alpine garden, Arbor, Container, Groundcover, Specimen. The root is a source of starch[200]. Sweet potato tubers are being examined as a valuable raw material for producing alcohol bio-fuel[418]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant. Sweet potato is a plant of the tropics, but can also be grown in the subtropics and, if there is a sufficient growing season of 110 - 170 days, as an annual crop in warmer parts of the temperate zone. It is grown in the tropics at elevations up to 2,800 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 28°c, but can tolerate 10 - 38°c[418]. When dormant, the roots can survive temperatures down to about 1°c, but young growth can be killed by temperatures of 5°c[418]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 750 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 350 - 5,000mm[418].An easily grown plant, it prefers a well-drained, sandy loam soil and requires a sunny position[200, 264]. Ample potash in the soil is essential for a good crop[264]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 7, tolerating 4 - 8.7[418]. A low humidity as the plants reach maturity is beneficial[200].Plants grow very vigorously in the tropics. They have escaped from cultivation in some areas and become invasive[296, 305].Unlike many root crops, the sweet potato begins to store starch at an early age, making early harvests possible[298]. It is one of the most efficient plants to capture the energy of the sun as calories[298].The plant can mature a crop within 2 months in tropical areas, though at least three months are required in sub-tropical regions[264].Optimum yields vary from 17.5 - 27.5 tonnes per hectare depending on the cultivar and growing conditions, while average yields are 5 tonnes per hectare in Africa, 10 tonnes in South America and 16 tonnes in Asia. The world highest production yield at 80 tonnes has been obtained in Israel[418].A short-day plant, it requires less than 11 hours of sunlight per day to initiate flowering[200]. However, day length variation appears to have little effect upon tuber production[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water, or scarify the seed, and sow in individual pots in a greenhouse in early spring. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 weeks at 22°c. Plants are extremely resentful of root disturbance, even when they are quite small, and should be potted up almost as soon as they germinate. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings can be very variable and are likely to be less productive than vegetatively produced plants[200]. Stem cuttings obtained from terminal shoots[200]. Remove the lower leaves and insert the cuttings to half their depth in individual pots."
