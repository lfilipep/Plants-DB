24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, preferring a moist to wet but well-drained humus-rich soil in a shady position or a cool sunny place by water but sheltered from hot drying winds[187, 200, 233]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Hardy to at least -20°c[187]. Plants spread slowly by means of a stout creeping rhizome, eventually forming large clumps[187]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
