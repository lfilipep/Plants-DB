4,Known Hazards,The plants contain alkaloids of carcinogens and also an amino-acid that causes chronic nervous disorders[200]. Regular consumption of the plant leads to severe health problems and death. This toxic principle can be removed if the food is properly prepared but consumption of the plant still cannot be recommended because its use often means the death of the plant and it is becoming rare in the wild.

18,Edible Uses,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.
19,Edible Uses Description,"The pith is rich in carbohydrate and a sago can be made from it[2, 46, 61, 177]. This use will kill the plant[K]. The raw seed is poisonous, but after being cut into thin slices, dried, then steeped in water for a few minutes and dried again, it becomes edible[2, 61, 63, 146, 177]. It can be used as a sago[2]. Using the seed for food cannot be recommended, however. See the notes above on toxicity. The very young leaves are edible[177]. The plant yields a gum[64, 146, 171]. No further details are given."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Specimen. Requires a strong loam with sharp sand and good drainage[1]. Succeeds in dry soils. Requires a sunny position[188]. This species is not fully hardy in Britain and requires greenhouse or conservatory protection over the winter, but it can be grown outdoors in the summer[1]. Plants are slow-growing[188]. This plant is often used as a food source in its native range but recent research has shown that it can cause chronic nervous disorders if it is not treated properly. Overall its use is not to be recommended, especially since it is becoming rare in the wild[200]. The plants produce special upward growing roots where nitrogen is produced in symbiosis with algae[175]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, There are no flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe, 2cm deep in individual pots which are then sealed in plastic bags to keep them moist until germination takes place. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 25°c[164]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water then treat as above. Division of suckers in the spring[188]."
