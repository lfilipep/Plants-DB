It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Dysentery  FebrifugeThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226]. The bark of this species is used interchangeably with S. alba. It is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, gout, inflammatory stages of auto-immune diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, feverish illnesses, neuralgia and headache[238]. The bark is removed during the summer and dried for later use[238]. The leaves are used internally in the treatment of minor feverish illnesses and colic[238]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Salix / Willow for diseases accompanied by fever, rheumatic ailments, headaches (see [302] for critics of commission E).","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs.

The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[131]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The dried leaves have a pleasant aromatic aroma and can be used in pot-pourri[245]. Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11].",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Best planted into its permanent position when young[11]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. The dried or bruised leaves have a sweet aromatic fragrance[245]. The scent resembles oil of wintergreen and is due to the presence of salicyl aldehyde[245]. Cultivated for its use in basket making, there are several named varieties[131]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days.
