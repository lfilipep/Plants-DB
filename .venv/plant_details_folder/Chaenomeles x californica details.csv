22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"The hybrid C. x californica is a tri-species hybrid (C. x superba x C. cathayensis). Named cultivars are available in the horticultural trade. Chaenomeles x californica is a strong growing quince with an upright crown reaching 1.8m high and wide. 'Enchantress' is a compact shrub single white to pink flowers and large yellow edible fruits. ?'Masterpiece' has large ovate fruit and pink-red flowers.  Easily cultivated in any reasonably good soil[1, 200]. Prefers a deep moist well-drained loam[4, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates full shade but requires a sunny position for best fruit production[3, 11, 200]. Becomes chlorotic on very alkaline soils[188, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -25c[200]. Plants are subject to canker, especially when growing in the milder moister areas of Britain[49]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Fruits are usually freely produced in Britain, but they do not always ripen[11, 182].  A good bee plant, flowering early in the year and providing pollen and nectar[108]. Landscape Uses: Border, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Woodland garden. Special Features: Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in February in a greenhouse[78]. Germination usually takes place within 6 weeks[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If well grown, these seedling can be large enough to plant out in the summer, but give them some protection in their first winter. Otherwise plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. This species is a hybrid and so will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Easy[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a cold frame. Layering in late spring or in autumn. This is a sure and easy method, though it takes 12 months[78, 200].",
