A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -25c[200]. Plants are subject to canker, especially when growing in the milder moister areas of Britain[49].

Special Features: Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in February in a greenhouse[78]. Germination usually takes place within 6 weeks[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If well grown, these seedling can be large enough to plant out in the summer, but give them some protection in their first winter. Otherwise plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. This species is a hybrid and so will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Easy[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a cold frame. Layering in late spring or in autumn. This is a sure and easy method, though it takes 12 months[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
