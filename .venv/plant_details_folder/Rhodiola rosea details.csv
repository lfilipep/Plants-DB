13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rhodiola rosea is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 1 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The young succulent leaves and shoots are eaten raw or cooked like spinach[2, 52, 62, 85, 172, 183]. A slightly bitter taste, we find them unpleasant on their own though they can be used as a small part of a mixed salad[K]. They can be made into a sauerkraut[257]. Stems - cooked and eaten like asparagus[183]. Root - raw or cooked[106, 183, 257]. It was fermented before being eaten by the N. American Indians[172]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Adaptogen: Helps the body ,Antidepressant: Used to alleviate mood disorders, such as major depression and dysthymia and anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Adaptogen  Antidepressant  Stomachic  TBThough little known as a medicinal plant, rose root has been used in traditional European medicine for over three thousand years, mainly as a tonic. Modern research has shown that it increases the body's resistance to any type of stress by regulating the body's hormonal response. Its use has been shown to have a protective effect upon the neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine in the brain. It improves neurotransmitter activity by inhibiting their enzymatic destruction and preventing their decline caused by excessive stress hormone release. Rose root also enhances the transport of serotonin's precursors into the brain and studies have shown that use of this herb can increase brain serotonin by up to 30%[255]. The root is adaptogen. It has an enhancing effect upon physical endurance and sexual potency. A decoction of the flowers has been used to treat stomach aches and intestinal discomfort[257]. The raw flowers have been eaten in the treatment of tuberculosis[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:Plants can be grown as a ground cover when planted about 30cm apart each way[208].Other Uses:An extract of the root is used in cosmetic preparations as an antioxidant, astringent and skin conditioner[1243].The dried root smells strongly of roses. They may be used to distill rose-water[245]. Ornamental."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile well drained open loam in a sunny position[83, 200]. Tolerates fairly damp conditions but prefers a raised well-drained spot[83]. Established plants are drought resistant[190]. This species is extremely polymorphic[200]. Plants often self-sows when they are growing in a suitable position[83]. They can self-sow to the point of nuisance[K]. The dried root has a rose scent[1, 83]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a sunny position in a greenhouse in spring. Do not let the compost dry out. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in early summer of the following year. Division in August to October[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings taken in the growing season[200]. Basal shoots in early summer are easiest. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
