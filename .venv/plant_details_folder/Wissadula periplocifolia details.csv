20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"An excellent fibre is obtained from the bark[46 , 454 ]. The stems strip well and readily and the bark 'retts' out, leaving a fine fibre of a type to compete with jute (Corchorus spp.)[454 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Regional CropTropical and sub-tropical humid climate. The plant thrives magnificently in barren and rocky soils[454 ]. It is estimated that as much as 1 tonne of stripped bark can be obtained from a hectare, and that from 25 - 40% of cleaned fibre could be obtained from this[454 ]. Plants growing very near to each other will produce very tall stems, say from 3 - 3.6 metres tall and straight, but those that happen to grow far apart will send out side branches and make lower growth with shorter, less useful fibres[454 ].",
