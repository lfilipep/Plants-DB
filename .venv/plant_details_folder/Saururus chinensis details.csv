22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"This is a plant for a boggy area of the garden, it is able to withstand temporary flooding[56]. It prefers a loamy soil[1] growing well in pond margins though it spreads vigorously[56]. It can succeed in damp sites in the woodland as well as in the bog garden[200]. Plants are fairly cold tolerant, but are best given a protective mulch in the winter[56]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in early autumn. Sow stored seed in late winter or early spring. Keep the pots moist by standing them in shallow water[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[1, 200]. The plants spread freely and division is possible at almost any time in the growing season. Divisions taken in mid to late summer should be overwintered in pots in a cold frame and then be planted out in late spring. Regular division maintains the vigour of the plant[200]."
