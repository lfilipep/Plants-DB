Form: Oval.","Carya ovata is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf from June to October, in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",C. alba. (L.)Nutt. non Koch. Juglans ovata.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Milk: made from plants, that is.","d - raw or cooked and used in pies, cakes, bread etc[2, 4, 61, 62, 183]. Sweet and delicious[1, 117, 183]. The seed can be ground into a meal and used to thicken soups etc[183]. A nut milk can be prepared from the seed and this is used as a butter on bread, vegetables etc[183]. The shell is normally thick and hard[101] but in selected cultivars it can be thin[159]. The seed ripens in late autumn and can be stored for up to 2 years in a cool cellar[117]. The seed is up to 4cm long[229]. Sap - sweet[257]. It is tapped in spring[101] and can be made into a syrup[226].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  AntirheumaticThe fresh small shoots have been steamed to make an inhalant for treating headaches[257]. A decoction of the bark has been taken internally to treat rheumatism and also used as a poultice on rheumatic joints[257].,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark[226].  - close-grained, tough, elastic, heavy and very hard. It weighs 52lb per cubic foot[227]. An excellent quality wood, it is used for tool handles, wheel spokes, sporting goods, baskets etc[46, 61, 63, 82, 227, 229]. The wood is an excellent fuel, burning well and giving off a lot of heat[229]. It produces an excellent charcoal[229]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilLandscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Prefers a deep moisture-retentive loam in a sunny sheltered position, requiring a good summer for best development[1, 63, 137, 200]. Succeeds in drier soils than most members of this genus[200]. Slow growing[200]. A very ornamental but slow-growing tree[1, 11, 227], it grows well in Britain, especially when young[11, 137], and does well in Cornwall[59]. The tree has a loose grey bark that comes away in broad flakes and gives the tree its common name[11]. The shagbark hickory is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[183]. It tends to be low-yielding[117] and is said to be of no value in Britain as a commercial nut crop[11]. Trees take 15 years to come into flower from seed[117]. This species is the fastest growing hickory in N. America, it can fruit in ten years from seed[137]. Recommended cultivars (these are often hybrids with C. cathayensis or C. laciniosa) include:- Shagbarks - 'J Yoder No. 1', heavy cropping and early[200]. 'Porter'. 'Weschcke', a very thin shell and regular cropper[200]. 'Wilcox', an excellent producer[200]. Shellbarks (these are more likely to be hybrids with C. laciniosa) - 'Fayette', thin shelled[200]. 'Henry', a very large nut[200]. Cultivated as a timber tree in C. Europe[50]. Plants are strongly tap-rooted and should be planted in their permanent positions as soon as possible[1, 137]. Sowing in situ would be the best method so long as the seed could be protected from mice[1, 200]. Trees are late coming into leaf (usually late May to June) and lose their leaves early in the autumn (usually in October)[137]. During this time they cast a heavy shade. These factors combine to make the trees eminently suitable for a mixed woodland planting with shrubs and other trees beneath them[137]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Most species in this genus have quite a wide range of distribution and, in order to find trees more suited to this country, seed from the most appropriate provenances should be sought[137]. Most trees growing in Britain at present tend to only produce good seed after hot summers[137]. Trees are self-fertile but larger crops of better quality seeds are produced if cross-pollination takes place[229]. The leaves are aromatic[245].  Special Features:North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - requires a period of cold stratification. It is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[78]. Stored seed should be kept moist (but not wet) prior to sowing and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as possible[78]. Where possible, sow 1 or 2 seeds only in each deep pot and thin to the best seedling. If you need to transplant the seedlings, then do this as soon as they are large enough to handle, once more using deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Put the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in their first summer, and give them some protection from the cold for at least the first winter[78, K]. Seed can also be sown in situ so long as protection is given from mice etc and the seed is given some protection from cold[200] (a plastic bottle with the top and bottom removed and a wire mesh top fitted to keep the mice out is ideal)",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
