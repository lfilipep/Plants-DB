0,Euphorbia pekinensis,Da Ji,Euphorbiaceae,Coming soon,"The sap contains a latex which is toxic on ingestion and highly irritant externally, causing photosensitive skin reactions and severe inflammation, especially on contact with eyes or open cuts. The toxicity can remain high even in dried plant material[200]. Prolonged and regular contact with the sap is inadvisable because of its carcinogenic nature[214].","Grassy places in lowland and mountains, C. and S. Japan[58].","E.

It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Epilepsy: Used in the treatment of Epilepsy - a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Diuretic  Epilepsy  Purgative  VasodilatorDa Ji is classified as a toxic herb in Chinese medicine and so is only prescribed for relatively serious diseases[254]. It is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs[218] and is used as a cathartic to purge excess fluids in conditions such as pleurisy and ascites and for the treatment of kidney problems, especially nephritis[254]. Research has shown that it is therapeutically useful in the treatment of ascites and nephritis, but it does produce significant side-effects[254]. It should only be used under the supervision of a qualified herbalist[254]. The root is antibacterial, diuretic, emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and vasodilator[176, 218, 238]. It is used in the treatment of oedema, fullness of the chest, sticky sputum, epilepsy, carbuncle and tubercle[176]. When used in conjunction with liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species) the diuretic and purgative actions are inhibited[176]. Another report says that the plant is incompatible with liquorice because it neutralizes their medicinal effects[254]. Externally, it is applied to inflamed sores to reduce swelling[254].",,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. It is a polymorphic species[58]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a light well-drained moderately rich loam in an open position[200]. Succeeds in dry soils[1]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200]. The ripe seed is released explosively from the seed capsules[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. This genus has been singled out as a potential source of latex (for making rubber) for the temperate zone, although no individual species has been singled out[141].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
