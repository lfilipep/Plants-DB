0,Malus prunifolia rinkii,Chinese Apple,Rosaceae,3-7,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",Not known in a truly wild state.,E.

Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[200]. Cultivated for its edible fruit in China, there are many named varieties[11, 22]. This species is a famous fruit tree in N and NE China[266]. Many cultivars have been bred during its long cultivation, the fruit of which differ in shape, color, size, and ripening period[266]. It is also used in apple breeding programmes for its frost resistance[74]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
