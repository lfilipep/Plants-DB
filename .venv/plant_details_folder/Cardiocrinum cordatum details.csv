See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in August, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Lilium cordatum.

Requires a deep, very fertile humus-laden soil[233]. Prefers growing in woodland conditions[42, 200]. The dormant plant is in general hardy to about -10°c but it comes into growth very early in the year, sometimes in February, and the young growth is susceptible to frost damage[90, 200]. A monocarpic plant, the bulb takes about 7 years to reach flowering size but then dies after flowering. However, it produces a number of new bulblets at the base and can be propagated by these[47, 200]. These bulblets take 3 - 5 years to flower[200]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. When planting, only just cover the bulb with leafmould[47]. The bulb is very attractive to slugs, mice and voles and may require protection[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in the autumn. The plant has delayed epigeal germination and will often germinate in the spring but can take up to 2 years especially if the seed is stored prior to being sown[134]. An alternative is to mix the seed with some moist leafmould and seal it in a plastic bag. Keep this at a temperature of 20°c for 3 weeks then pot up any seed that germinates and place the rest in a fridge for 4 - 5 weeks at 3 - 5°c before sowing in a warm place[138]. Seedlings should be grown on in pots in a shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse for 3 - 4 years before planting them out in their permanent positions[138]. Bulblets are obtained from the base of the old plant after flowering. Pot up and plant out when well established.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
