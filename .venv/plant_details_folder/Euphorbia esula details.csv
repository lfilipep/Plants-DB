0,Latin Name,Euphorbia esula
1,Common Name,Leafy Spurge. Green spurge
2,Family,Euphorbiaceae
3,USDA hardiness,3-9
4,Known Hazards,"The sap contains a latex which is toxic on ingestion and highly irritant externally, causing photosensitive skin reactions and severe inflammation, especially on contact with eyes or open cuts. The toxicity can remain high even in dried plant material[200]. Prolonged and regular contact with the sap is inadvisable because of its carcinogenic nature[214]."
5,Habitats,"Found on prairies, savannas, mountain meadows, and near woodlands. It grows in fields and waste places."
6,Range,"Eurasia. Native to central and southern Europe, and eastward through most of Asia north of the Himalaya to Korea and eastern Siberia. Currently found worldwide with the exception of Australia and New Zealand."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Euphorbia esula is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Euphorbia esula has nutrient value similar to alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.) and provides nutritious forage for sheep and goats. Potential as a whole-plant biomass as a locally grown fuel crop for home-heating purposes (Maxwell et al., 1985). A high protein feed stock for grazing sheep and goats (Fox et al., 1991; Sedivec et al., 1995). The high protein diet result in very high quality mohair in angora goats (Stoneberg, 1989).  High in hydrocarbon latex - possibly a good col-hardy hydrocarbon species. Leafy spurge hay burns with 4x the energy of wheat straw [1-1]. Dynamic accumulator."
22,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Management: HayClimate: boreal to subtropical. Humidity: arid to humid. Prefers areas of full sunlight and dry soil but can tolerate a variety of habitats including temperatures as low as -45C (-49F). A deep-rooted perennial plant. Roots grow twice as fast in sandy soil as in clay soil. Roots in clay soil have greater branching than those in sandy soil. High levels of soil nitrogen can reduce the biomass of leafy spurge roots and lead to greater root concentrations near the top of the soil profile (U.S. Forest Service). Especially aggressive in semi-arid situations. Adapted to a wide range of conditions, from moist to dry with annual rainfalls as low as 180mm (7""). It grows as clusters with upright stems, 0.3 to 1m tall. Cultivation: experimental. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,It can grow from seed or from creeping roots. Reproduces readily like by seeds that have a high germination rate and may remain viable in the soil for at least eight years.
