This is one of three species (the others are S. Aristolochiifolia and S. regelii) that gained a high reputation in the 17th century as cure-alls[238 ]. They were widely imported into Europe until early in the 20th century, by which time their rather overrated reputation had waned somewhat. However, the plants do have a number of important medicinal benefits - in particular, their roots contain steroidal saponins which are an efective treatment for many cases of psoriasis; they also have hormonal effects, and may improve fertility in women with ovarian dysfunction[238 ]. The rhizomes are alterative, digestive, febrifuge[46 , 238 ]. A decoction is used in the treatment of fevers, digestive disorders, kidney troubles and gonorrhoea[46 ]. It is also used against scrophulus, skin diseases and rheumatism[46 ].",,None known,,Succeeds in sun or partial shade[200 ].
