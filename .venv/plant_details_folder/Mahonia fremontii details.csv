America.,(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaFremontii.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaFremontii2.jpg",,"Mahonia fremontii is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[257]. It is usually cooked[177]. An acid flavour but it is rather nice raw, especially when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. A beverage has been made from the fruit[257]. The ovoid fruit is about 15mm long[200].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Bitter  Dysentery  Hepatic  Laxative  TonicThe plant has been used as an aid for the gums[257]. The roots are bitter tonic, hepatic and laxative[257]. An infusion has been used to promote digestion[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A yellow dye has been obtained from the roots[257]. A purple dye has been obtained from the fruit[257].,,"Unlike most members of this genus, this species requires a dry, perfectly drained position in full sun, a gritty slightly acid soil is best[11, 200]. It grows best on a sunny south facing wall in Britain[11] and does well in a hot, dry position[184]. It requires a position sheltered from strong or cold winds[202]. Plants are only hardy in the milder areas of the country, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. Plants are slow-growing[202]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The flowers are refreshingly fragrant[245]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. This species is often confused with M. trifoliolata, which differs in only ever having 3 leaflets per leaf[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
