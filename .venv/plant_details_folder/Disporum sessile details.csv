24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Woodland garden. Best grown in partial shade in a moist peaty or woodland soil[1, 175]. Plants spread rapidly[188] by means of creeping rhizomes when they are grown in a leafy soil[187]. This species is very closely related to Disporum nantouense, and both species could be identical[266]. Special Features:Attractive foliage."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[175]. Use a lime-free compost and keep it moist[175]. Stored seed requires 6 weeks cold stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible[175]. Germination usually takes place within 3 - 6 months or more at 15°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200]."
