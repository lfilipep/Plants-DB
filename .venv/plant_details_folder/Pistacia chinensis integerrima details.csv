18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The fruit is used to impart a flavour to plant milks[183]. The following two uses have been given for the closely related P. chinensis and not for this species, but it is assumed that they do apply here also. Young shoots and leaves - cooked. Used as a vegetable[11, 46, 182, 183]. Seed - roasted and eaten or used in confectionery[105, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Dysentery  Expectorant  Miscellany  TonicGalls, produced on the tree in response to attacks by insects, are expectorant and tonic[240]. They are used in the treatment of coughs, phthisis, asthma, dysentery etc[240]. Resin from the closely related P. lentiscus is analgesic, antitussive, expectorant and sedative. It would be worthwhile examining this species[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant can be used as a rootstock for the pistachio nut, P. vera[200].  - very hard, durable, beautifully marked. Used in furniture making, carving etc[146, 158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position in a deep well-drained light soil[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Plants are prone to fungal root rots[200]. Any pruning that needs to be done is best carried out in the spring[238]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 16 hours in alkalized water[78], or for 3 - 4 days in warm water[1], and sow late winter in a cold frame or greenhouse[78, 113]. Two months cold stratification may speed up germination, so it might be better to sow the seed in early winter[113]. The germination is variable and can be slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving some protection from winter cold for their first year or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood from juvenile trees, July in a frame[113]. Layering."
