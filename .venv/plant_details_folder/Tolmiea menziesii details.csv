Although perfectly hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -17°c[200], this plant is often grown as a houseplant because of its interesting habit of producing new young plants on its old leaves[1]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of young plants in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring."
