24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in a well-drained moisture-retentive soil in an open sunny position[200]. Succeeds in light shade but fruits less well in such a position. This species is a bi-generic hybrid of garden origin between Sorbus aria and Pyrus communis[183].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise in late winter. The plant produces very little fertile seed, and this does not breed true[200], though some interesting plants might be produced[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Grafting is the best method of propagating this plant. This is best carried out in early spring, though budding can be carried out in the summer.",
