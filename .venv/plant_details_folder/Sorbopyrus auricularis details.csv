The plant produces very little fertile seed, and this does not breed true[200], though some interesting plants might be produced[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Grafting is the best method of propagating this plant. This is best carried out in early spring, though budding can be carried out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
