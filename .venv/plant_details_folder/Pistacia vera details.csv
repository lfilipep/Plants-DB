Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Rounded, Spreading or horizontal, Vase.","Pistacia vera is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft 10in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Oil: ","- raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 74]. The seed is rich in oil and has a pleasant mild flavour[2]. It is very nice when eaten raw and is also widely used in confectionery, ice cream, cakes, pies etc[183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed but is not produced commercially due to the high price of the seed[183]. The fruits can be made into a flavourful marmalade[183].","Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is not used commercially due to the high value of the seed for food[183]. Male trees yield a small quantity of a high grade resin.

Requires a sunny position in a deep well-drained light soil[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Does well in light calcareous soils[200]. Grows well on poor soils[200]. Prefers long hot summers and low humidity[200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain and are unlikely to succeed outdoors in any but the mildest areas of the country. They will be hardier in areas with long hot summers that will thoroughly ripen the wood. Plants are prone to fungal root rots[200]. The pistachio nut is often cultivated for its edible seed in warm temperate areas, there are many named forms[183]. It is very unlikely to produce a crop of seeds in Britain, simply because the summers here are not hot enough or long enough[K]. Any pruning that needs to be done is best carried out in the spring[238]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. One male plant for every five females is adequate[200]. Special Features:Edible, Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Pre-soak the seed for 16 hours in alkalized water[78], or for 3 - 4 days in warm water[1], and sow late winter in a cold frame or greenhouse[78, 113]. Two months cold stratification may speed up germination, so it might be better to sow the seed in early winter[113]. The germination is variable and can be slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving some protection from winter cold for their first year or two outdoors[K].
