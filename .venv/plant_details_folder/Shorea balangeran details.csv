There are no known edible and medicinal uses of this plant. However, it yields a dammar known as ?Tangkawang fat?, a hard resin, which is used for candle making, soap manufacturing, and for illumination. It has many other purposes and commercial applications but due to the availability of synthetic materials nowadays, it has become less significant. The wood is hard to very hard, heavy to very heavy, strong, and durable. It is used for construction, ship building, bridges, etc."

21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: A dammar, known as 'Tangkawang fat' is obtained from the tree[46 ]. It is used for candle making, soap manufacture and for illumination[46 ]. Dammar is a hard resin, obtained from various trees of Southeast Asia. Traditionally, it is used for purposes such as caulking boats and baskets, as an adhesive, a medicine, as a fuel for torches and sometimes in foods. Dammar has many commercial applications, though many of these uses are less important nowadays due to the advent of synthetic materials. Commercially, it is an ingredient of inks, lacquers, oil paints, varnishes etc, and is used as a glazing agent in foods[891 ]. Harvesting of the resin commences when the bole is around 25cm in diameter (approx 20 years old). Triangular cuts (becoming circular with age) are arranged in vertical rows around the trunk. The cuts are several centimetres wide at first, but become enlarged at every tapping and eventually become holes of 15 - 20cm in depth and width. The average number of holes for a tree about 30 metres tall and 60 - 80cm in diameter is 9 - 11 in each of 4 - 5 vertical rows. For the higher holes, the tapper climbs the tree supported by a rattan belt and using the lower holes as footholds. The exuded resin is allowed to dry on the tree before it is collected. The frequency with which the tree is visited to refreshen the cut varies from once a week to once a month, depending on how far the tree is from the village. Tapping can continue for 30 years[891 ]. The heartwood is grayish to yellowish gray; the moderately thick band of sapwood is light gray. The texture is fine; the grain interlocked. The wood is hard to very hard; heavy to very heavy; strong; durable. It is widely used for permanent construction, shipbuilding, and bridges[359 , 890 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of lowland areas in the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 100 metres[451 ]. Mostly found on poor sandy soils on alluvial sites or hillsides in the wild[359 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"We have no specific information for this species - the information below is a general guide for the genus. Seed - best sown as soon as possible. It does not require pre-treatment, but it is recommended to soak the seed for 12 hours prior to sowing[325 ]. The seeds are sown in seedbeds, where they are covered with a mixture of sand and soil (1:1) or with a thin layer of sawdust[325 ]. Germination of fresh seeds is usually good and rapid. About two weeks after germination, when the seedlings are 5 - 6cm tall, they are potted up into individual containers about 15 x 23cm with good drainage holes at their base[325 ]. It is normally recommended to use a mixture of forest soil and sand (at a ratio of 3:1) as the potting medium in order to introduce the appropriate mycorrhiza to the roots. The seedlings are placed in 50 - 60% sunlight and watered twice daily[325 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 30 - 40cm tall - harden the seedlings off in full sunlight for one month prior to planting[325 ]."
