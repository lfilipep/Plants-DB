It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Young leaves and flower buds - raw or cooked[105, 183]. When added to soup they thicken it in much the same way as okra[85, 159, 183]. Some caution is advised if the plant has yellow flowers since these can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62]. A tea can be made from the leaves[85, 183]. The flowers are candied.","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Dysentery  PoulticeA poultice of the leaves has been used to allay the pain of a headache[257]. An infusion of the plant has been used in the treatment of dysentery, coughs and colds[257]. A poultice of the crushed root has been applied to boils[257].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","Landscape Uses: Alpine garden, Border, Rock garden, Woodland garden. An infusion of the root has been used to soak corn seeds before planting in order to keep off insects[257]. Faunal Associations: The flowers attract long-tongued bees, small butterflies, and skippers. Bee visitors during the spring include bumblebees and Anthophorine bees. Compared to other violets, the flowers of this species attracts more butterflies and skippers, which are often held horizontal to the ground (face up) and easier for such insects to land on. The caterpillars of various Fritillary butterflies feed on the foliage and flowers; the caterpillars of Speyeria idalia (Regal Fritillary) may prefer this violet species over others as a food source. Ants are attracted to the sugary gel on the seeds, and help to distribute them [1-6].",,"A beautiful species but very difficult in cultivation[187]. It requires a very well-drained soil plus warmth and moisture in the summer. Some people have recommended that it should be grown on a clay soil, unpoisoned by humus[187]. It has been seen growing on the shaley bank of a newly-made road in full sun[187]. Cool moist well-drained humus-rich soil in partial or dappled shade and protection from scorching winds. Tolerates sandstone and limestone soils but becomes chlorotic if the pH is too high. Prefers a pH between 6 and 6.5. All members of this genus have more or less edible leaves and flower buds, though those species with yellow flowers can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62, 85, 159].  Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in the autumn or just after flowering. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
