23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Alpine garden, Border, Rock garden, Woodland garden. An infusion of the root has been used to soak corn seeds before planting in order to keep off insects[257]. Faunal Associations: The flowers attract long-tongued bees, small butterflies, and skippers. Bee visitors during the spring include bumblebees and Anthophorine bees. Compared to other violets, the flowers of this species attracts more butterflies and skippers, which are often held horizontal to the ground (face up) and easier for such insects to land on. The caterpillars of various Fritillary butterflies feed on the foliage and flowers; the caterpillars of Speyeria idalia (Regal Fritillary) may prefer this violet species over others as a food source. Ants are attracted to the sugary gel on the seeds, and help to distribute them [1-6].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A beautiful species but very difficult in cultivation[187]. It requires a very well-drained soil plus warmth and moisture in the summer. Some people have recommended that it should be grown on a clay soil, unpoisoned by humus[187]. It has been seen growing on the shaley bank of a newly-made road in full sun[187]. Cool moist well-drained humus-rich soil in partial or dappled shade and protection from scorching winds. Tolerates sandstone and limestone soils but becomes chlorotic if the pH is too high. Prefers a pH between 6 and 6.5. All members of this genus have more or less edible leaves and flower buds, though those species with yellow flowers can cause diarrhoea if eaten in large quantities[62, 85, 159].  Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in the autumn or just after flowering. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",
