1,Common Name,Evergreen Maidenhair Fern
2,Family,Polypodiaceae
3,USDA hardiness,9-11
4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]."
5,Habitats,"Rock crevices and on forest slopes, 1700 - 2200 metres in Kashmir[145]. Moist, shady, rocky places in Nepal at elevations of 300 - 3,600 metres[272]."

Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position. Division in spring or autumn."
