22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. However, judging by its native range, it is likely to succeed outdoors in most areas of the country. The plant is generally a biennial, flowering and then dying in its second year. However, it often produces offsets by which it perennates[279]. It also freely produces seed[200]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a position in full sun in a gritty well-drained soil[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually free and rapid[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out in the summer. Consider giving some protection from the wet during winter.,
