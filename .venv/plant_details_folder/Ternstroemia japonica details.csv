Succeeds in north-facing sites[200]. Generally considered to be a tender shrub, but it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c if the wood has been well-ripened[200] and succeeds outdoors in the mildest maritime areas of Britain[182, 200]. Any pruning is best carried out in spring[188]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Sow stored seed in a greenhouse in early spring[188]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. Grow the young plants on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half ripe wood, August in a frame[200]."
