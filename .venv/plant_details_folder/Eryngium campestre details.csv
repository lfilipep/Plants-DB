24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained soil and a sunny position[1]. Prefers a light sandy soil but tolerates most soil types including lime and poor gravels[200]. The plant has deep and wide-ranging roots, it can spread freely in the garden and become difficult to eradicate[4]. Plants should be put in their final position whilst small since they resent root disturbance[200]. The plant is often used in dried flower arrangements since it retains its colour for a long time[7]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early autumn on the surface of a well-drained compost in a cold frame[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. It usually germinates in 5 - 90 days at 20°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring or autumn. Take care since the plant resents root disturbance[200]. Root cuttings in autumn or winter[200]."
