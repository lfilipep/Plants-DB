24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich moist soil[85] but succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. Japanese millet is sometimes cultivated in India and E. Asia for its edible seed, especially in areas where rice will not grow. There are some named varieties[1, 61, 74, 171]. Plants can produce a crop of seeds within 6 weeks of sowing in warmer areas of the world[179, 183] but obtaining a reasonable crop is more problematic in the cooler summers of Britain. The plants need to be started off early in a greenhouse in order to give sufficient growing time. They are also more likely to succeed in the eastern side of the country where the summers are usually warmer and drier."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. A sowing in situ in late spring might also succeed but is unlikely to ripen a crop of seed if the summer is cool and wet."
