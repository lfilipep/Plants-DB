22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows well in a sandy freely draining loam where it flowers freely in a sunny position[11]. Succeeds in dry soils[11, 202]. Plants tolerate partial shade if they are grown in a perfectly draining lean soil[200]. They are very tolerant of maritime exposure[75, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is not very hardy in Britain, succeeding outdoors only in the milder areas of the country and tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. The plants do not have leaves, but they have very sharp spines which are used instead of the leaves in the function of photosynthesis[188]. The flowers are fragrant[188]. They have the scent of vanilla[202]. A very slow growing plant[75]. The form 'Rosea' is stronger-growing[202].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing fresh seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse and stored seed as early in the year as it is received. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Cuttings of mature side shoots of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, early winter in a cold frame. Leave for 18 months before potting up. Good percentage[78].",
