24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"S. torvum is an erect or spreading prickly shrub, 1 to 3 m tall. A plant of the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,600 metres. Succeeds in full sun and in light shade [418 ]. Grows well in a range of fertile, moist but well-drained soils [418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6 (acidic), tolerating 4.3 - 6.8 [418 ]. Plants can tolerate some drought [305 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 17 - 29°c, but can tolerate 12 - 35°c [418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,200mm [418 ]. Heavy rainfall discourages fruit set [418 ]. The plant is spread by birds that eat the fruits and spread the seeds. It is considered to be a major weed in pastures, along roadsides and in wasteland in the tropics. It also occurs in plantations, but is not found in significant quantities in cultivated land [305 ]. Often found in disturbed areas, it can form dense impenetrable stands. Solanum torvum is considered to be a serious threat to the productivity and sustainability of pasture [413 ]. Besides its economic impacts, it competes with native species [413 ]. The plant commences flowering when 3 - 4 months old and is said to have an economic life of 3 - 5 years[299 , 418 ]. The plant can flower and produce fruit all year round [266 ]. It can regrow after a fire [305 ]. There are named forms in Africa and in Thailand [299 , 301 ]. At least one form is free of prickles [777].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a sunny position [299 ]. The fresh seed shows strong dormancy. Seed is sown in a nursery and seedlings are transplanted after 5 - 6 weeks at a spacing of 1 metre [299 ]. Branch cuttings taken from high-yielding shrubs are also used for propagation. Semi-hardwood cuttings 12 - 15cm long, collected from fresh shoots and with their leaves removed, will produce roots and new shoots in 3 - 4 weeks [299 ].",
