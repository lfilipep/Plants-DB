It is in flower from January to April, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Milk: made from plants, that is.,Oil: ,Oil: ","ed - raw or roasted and used in breads, cakes, biscuits, sweets etc[2, 5, 9, 12, 13, 34, 183]. An excellent nut for raw eating[K]. They can also be liquidized and used as a plant milk[183]. Rich in oil. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. A clear yellow edible oil is obtained from the seed[7, 9, 183]. It is used in salad dressings, baking etc.","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Nutritive: A food for convalescents to help restore strength.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health.

The whole seed can be used to polish and oil wood[6]. It is very easy to apply and produces a nice finish[K]. The finely ground seeds are used as an ingredient of face masks in cosmetics[7]. Plants can be grown as a tall hedge[29]. They need to be left untrimmed or only lightly trimmed if seed is required[29]. The bark and leaves are a source of tannin[7].  - soft, easy to split, not very durable, beautifully veined. Used for inlay work, small items of furniture, hurdles, wattles, basketry, pea sticks etc[7, 13, 23, 46, 61, 63, 66, 125]. The twigs are used as dowsing rods by water diviners[11]. The wood also yields a good quality charcoal, used by artists[63, 101].","Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world.

An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, but is in general more productive of seeds when grown on soils of moderate fertility[11, 200]. It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Succeeds in a pH range 4.5 to 8.5, but prefers a range of 5 to 7[200]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. A very hardy plant, succeeding in all areas of Britain[200]. The flowers, however, are produced in late winter and early spring and can be damaged by heavy frosts at this time[200]. A parent, together with C. maxima, of many cultivated forms of filberts and cob nuts. There are many named varieties[11]. Plants are self-fertile but a more certain crop is obtained if more than one cultivar is grown[200]. The main difference between cob nuts and filberts is that the husk of a filbert is longer than the seed and often completely encloses it, whilst the husk on a cob nut is shorter than the seed[200]. Squirrels are a major pest of this plant, often decimating the crop of nuts[200]. Often grown as a coppiced shrub in woodlands, the stems have a variety of uses[23, 67, 186]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11]. A food plant for the caterpillars of many lepidoptera species[30].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in early spring. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
