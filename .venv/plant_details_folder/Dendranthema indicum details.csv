24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most well-drained fertile soils in a sunny position[1, 200]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c and should succeed outdoors in most parts of Britain[260]. This species is closely related to D. x grandiflorum (the cultivated chrysanthemum) according to one report[58] whilst another says that it is a parent of the cultivated chrysanthemum[1]. It has been proposed (1999) to restore this species to Chrysanthemum as C. indicum L. since the plant is so widely known under this name. When bruised, the foliage has a pungent refreshing fragrance that is somewhat lemon-like and reminiscent of chamomile[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring to early summer in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[200]. It usually germinates in 10 - 18 days at 15°c but if it does not germinate within 4 weeks then try chilling the seed for 3 weeks in the salad compartment of a fridge[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
