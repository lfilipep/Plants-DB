24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sandy medium, rich in decaying organic matter, in full sun[200]. Plants overwinter as resting buds at the bottom of the pond[1]. Another report says that the plants do not form winter buds, but persist at the bottom of the pond[56]. This species is considered to have the potential to be invasive when introduced into some areas such as Texas[274]. A good water oxygenator[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but the seed is quite probably of limited germination, especially if it becomes dry, and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if this is possible. Otherwise store the seed in a cool place in a jar of water and sow in the spring. Keep the pots in trays of water. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the spring. Cuttings can be inserted directly into the soil of the pond at any time in the growing season[56]. Division."
