See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to April. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Buddleja asiatica,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.",The dried and powdered root is used in the preparation of a fermented liquor[183].,"Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The juice f the plant is applied as a wash to treat skin diseases[272].",Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,"- tough, moderately hard. It could be used for making walking sticks[158].",,"Requires a sunny position, succeeding in most reasonably good soils so long as they are well-drained[1, 11, 182, 200]. Prefers a rich loamy soil[11]. Plants are very tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. Of doubtful hardiness in most of Britain, it is likely to be damaged or killed by temperatures lower than 0°c[260]. However, one report says that it succeeds outdoors in southern Cornwall[1] whilst other reports say that it might be hardy on a south or south-west facing wall in the mildest areas of this country[11, 166, 182, 188]. So long as the plant is well mulched it resprouts freely from the base if cut back by severe weather[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], the cut flowers last well in water[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Any pruning is best done after flowering[200]. An excellent plant for bees and butterflies. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - cold stratify for 4 weeks at 4°c[138] and surface sow the seed in February/March in a greenhouse[78, 113] (the pre-chilling might not be required for this species). Germination usually takes place within 3 - 4 weeks at 21°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are inclined to damp off and so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Use short side-shoots[78]. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long, October/November in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
