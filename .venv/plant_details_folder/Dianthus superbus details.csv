4,Known Hazards,"The plant contains saponins but apparently in quantities too low to cause harm[179]. Although fairly toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without harm. Saponins are found in many foods, such as beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]."

18,Edible Uses,Nectar: produced in such abundance by some flowers that it can be harvested fairly easily.
19,Edible Uses Description,"aves, stems and tops are boiled, steeped in water and eaten as a potherb[105, 177, 179, 183]. Young plants are also eaten[183]. One report says that they contain saponins but that the leaves are apparently not toxic[179]. Probably this is because the content of saponins is too low to be harmful[K]. Children suck the flowers for their sweet edible nectar[105, 177, 183]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Antibacterial  Astringent  Contraceptive  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Febrifuge  Haemostatic  Ophthalmic  Resolvent  Tonic  Urinary  VulneraryThe fringed pink, called Qu Mai in Chinese herbalism, has been used in Chinese herbal medicine for over 2,000 years. The whole plant is a bitter tonic herb that stimulates the digestive and urinary system, and also the bowels[238]. It also lowers blood pressure, reduces fevers and controls bacterial infections[218, 238]. Little used on its own, it is often taken with Dan Shen (Salvia multiorrhiza) to induce menstruation[254]. The closely related D. chinensis has the same uses as Qu Mai and is more commonly used[238]. The plant is abortifacient, contraceptive, diuretic, emmenagogue, ophthalmic, tonic and vulnerary[147, 176, 178, 218]. It is said to promote hair growth[147, 176, 178]. It is ranked 9th in a list of 250 potential antifertility Chinese plants[218]. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (especially cystitis), urinary stones, constipation and failure to menstruate[238]. Externally, it is applied to skin inflammations and swellings[238]. The leaves are used in the treatment of haemorrhoids, lumbricoid worms, venereal sores etc[218]. The flowers are astringent, diuretic, haemostatic, resolvent and vulnerary[218]. Research has shown that the flowers are the most markedly diuretic part of the plant[254]."
