0,Dianthus superbus,Fringed Pink,Caryophyllaceae,4-8,"The plant contains saponins but apparently in quantities too low to cause harm[179]. Although fairly toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without harm. Saponins are found in many foods, such as beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",Woody hills and dry meadows[100].,Europe to N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",D. wimmeri.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",Nectar: produced in such abundance by some flowers that it can be harvested fairly easily.,"aves, stems and tops are boiled, steeped in water and eaten as a potherb[105, 177, 179, 183]. Young plants are also eaten[183]. One report says that they contain saponins but that the leaves are apparently not toxic[179]. Probably this is because the content of saponins is too low to be harmful[K]. Children suck the flowers for their sweet edible nectar[105, 177, 183].","Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Contraceptive: Prevents fertilization occurring in females.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow.

The whole plant is a bitter tonic herb that stimulates the digestive and urinary system, and also the bowels[238]. It also lowers blood pressure, reduces fevers and controls bacterial infections[218, 238]. Little used on its own, it is often taken with Dan Shen (Salvia multiorrhiza) to induce menstruation[254]. The closely related D. chinensis has the same uses as Qu Mai and is more commonly used[238]. The plant is abortifacient, contraceptive, diuretic, emmenagogue, ophthalmic, tonic and vulnerary[147, 176, 178, 218]. It is said to promote hair growth[147, 176, 178]. It is ranked 9th in a list of 250 potential antifertility Chinese plants[218]. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (especially cystitis), urinary stones, constipation and failure to menstruate[238]. Externally, it is applied to skin inflammations and swellings[238]. The leaves are used in the treatment of haemorrhoids, lumbricoid worms, venereal sores etc[218]. The flowers are astringent, diuretic, haemostatic, resolvent and vulnerary[218]. Research has shown that the flowers are the most markedly diuretic part of the plant[254].",,None known,,"Prefers an alkaline soil but tolerates slightly acid soils[200]. Succeeds in any well-drained peaty soil in sun or light shade[187]. Plants succeed when grown on the top of a broad or retaining wall[219]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[187]. The flowers have a soft sweet perfume[245].","Seed - sow April/June in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 weeks at 20°c.
