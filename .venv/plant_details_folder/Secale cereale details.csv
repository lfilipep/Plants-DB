0,Secale cereale,"Rye, Cereal rye",Poaceae or Gramineae,3-7,None known,Not known in a truly wild situation.,W. Asia? Original habitat is obscure.,(4 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SecaleCereale.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SecaleCereale2.jpg",,"Secale cereale is a ANNUAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Oil: ,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.","rSeed - cooked[2, 13, 34, 46]. A common cereal, it is used especially in N. Europe to make bread[183]. The seed contains about 13% protein[61]. The grain also contains some gluten, though not as much as wheat, so it makes a heavier bread than wheat. It can also be used to make cakes etc. The seed can be sprouted and added to salads[183]. A nutritional analysis is available[218]. Malt, a sweet substance produced by germinating the seed, is extracted from the roasted germinated seed and used as a sweetening agent and in making beer etc[13]. The roasted (ungerminated) seed is used as a coffee substitute[46, 183].","Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cancer  Laxative  PoulticeThe seed is made into a poultice and applied to tumours[218]. The seed is also an effective laxative due to its fibrous seed coat[269].,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.","The straw is used as a fuel or as a biomass in industry[141]. It is quite strong[100] and can also be used in thatching, for paper making, weaving mats and hats etc[13, 34, 46, 61, 171]. Other uses for the straw include as a packing material for nursery stock, bricks and tiles, for bedding, archery targets, and mushroom compost[269]. The plant is a good green manure crop. It is fast growing with an extensive and deep root system[46]. It is especially useful if sown in late autumn. Its growth over the winter will prevent soil erosion and the leaching of nutrients from the soil, it can then be incorporated into the soil in the spring[171]. The extensive root system also makes this a good plant to use for soil stabilization, especially on sandy soils[171].",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but prefers a well-drained light soil in a sunny position[1, 132]. It thrives on infertile, submarginal areas and is renouned for its ability to grow on sandy soils[269]. Established plants are drought tolerant[1]. The plant is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of of 22 to 176cm, an annual temperature in the range of of 4.3 to 21.3°C and a pH of 4.5 to 8.2[269]. Rye is a widely cultivated temperate zone cereal crop. It is able to withstand severe climatic conditions and can be grown much further north and at higher altitudes than wheat[13, 34, 57]. Average yields vary widely from country to country, the world average is around 1.6 tonnes per hectare with yields of almost 7 tonnes per hectare achieved in Norway[269]. There are many named varieties[183]. Rye is a rather variable species and botanists have divided it into a number of sub-species, all of which could be of value in breeding programmes. These sub-species are briefly listed below:- S. cereale afghanicum (Vavilov.)K.Hammer. Native to the Caucasus, western Asia and India. S. cereale ancestrale Zhuk. Native to western Asia. S. cereale dighoricum Vavilov. Native to the Caucasus and eastern europe. S. cereale segetale Zhuk. Native to temperate Asia. Rye grows well with cornflowers and pansies[18, 20], though it inhibits the growth of poppies and couch grass[18, 20]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1].",Seed - sow March or October in situ and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
