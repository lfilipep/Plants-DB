It can be found in northern Mexico south to northern Argentina. It is the national tree of Paraguay and is planted in gardens and boulevards as an ornamental tree. It has a straight bole and a large, round but often sparse canopy. The leaves are opposite, and palmately compound with usually five leaflets. The bark is brownish gray in color, tough, and hard to peel. Tea which is used as a tonic can be made from the inner bark. The plant is used in the treatment of a wide range of conditions such as wounds, fevers, dysentery, chronic degenerative diseases, cancers, inflammatory diseases, fungal infections, skin conditions, etc. The wood is yellowish in color, vary tough and heavy. It is ideal for heavy construction, railway sleepers, bridges, posts and poles, etc.","Handroanthus impetiginosus is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil.

The heartwood contains a naphthaquinone called lapachol - this has been shown to have antibiotic and antitumor effects[238 ]. Many native S. American peoples have prized pau d'arco as a cure-all, using it to treat a wide range of conditions including wounds, fevers, dysentery, intestinal inflammation and snake bites[254 ]. In modern herbalism the bark is used internally in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, chronic degenerative diseases, cancers, tumours, cysts, fungal infections (especially candidiasis), venereal diseases, rheumatic diseases, skin problems (especially eczema, herpes and scabies)[238 ]. It is also used, in combination with other herbs, to clear toxins, resolve congestion and strengthen the immune system[238 ]. The wood is harvested as required and dried for later use[238 ].",Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,"Other Uses: The heartwood is greenish to yellowish-brown; the sapwood is yellowish. The texture is medium; the grain interlocked; lustre is medium. The wood is very heavy, durable, especially when not in contact with the soil. It can be very hard to cut, but works well and gives a good finish. The timber, known as lapacho, is highly valued for cabinet making. It is also used for railway ties, telegraph poles, interior finishes, parquet flooring, sports items such as wooded balls, musical instruments etc[238 , 363 , 419 ]. Most species of Handroanthus, almost certainly including this one, produce a very hard, heavy and durable timber known as Ipe. The general description of Ipe wood is as follows:- The heartwood is yellowish brown to dark olive brown, sometimes with thin veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 9cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is usually fine, though it is medium in some species; the grain is interlocked; there are canals in the wood containing a greenish-yellow deposit of lapachol. The wood is very heavy; very hard; elastic; it is very durable, even in contact with the soil, resisting fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly, but with only a low risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect - stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; there can be some difficulties due to the interlocked grain; filling is recommended in order to get a good finish; nailing and screwing are good , but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for internal use only, and needs to be done with care because the wood is so dense. A very durable and strong wood, it has a very wide range of uses, especially for outdoor applications. It is used for making high class furniture, cabinet work, heavy construction, railway sleepers, bridges, hydraulic works, industrial flooring, posts and poles, turnery, musical instruments, tool handles, veneer etc[848 ].",,"A species of higher elevations in the tropics, it is well-suited to subtropical areas[307 ]. Prefers a well-drained fertile soil and a position in full sun[238 ]. Young plants establish well, achieving heights of around 3.5 metres within 2 years[419 ]. Flowering Time: Late Winter/Early Spring Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: Pink. Spacing: 20-30 ft. (6-9 m).","Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a nursery seedbed or individual containers[200 , 419 ]. The germination rate is usually high, occurring in 10 - 12 days. Seedlings grow away quickly and are usually ready to plant out in less than 4 months[419 ]. Air layering. Cuttings of half ripe wood, herbaceous stem cuttings, softwood cuttings, semi-hardwood cuttings.
