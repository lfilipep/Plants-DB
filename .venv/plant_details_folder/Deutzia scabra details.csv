The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",D. crenata.

An easily grown plant, it tolerates most soils but prefers a moist well-drained fertile humus-rich soil with shade from the early morning sun when grown in areas with late frosts[11, 200]. Prefers a sunny sheltered position, it can be grown on a woodland edge[184]. Tolerates a limey soil[11]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. The young growth, however, is subject to damage by late frosts and so a suitable position with shelter from early morning spring sunshine is best. A very ornamental plant[1], it is the best and most reliable species in this genus for growing in Britain[11]. A number of cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Flowers are produced on the previous seasons wood[182]. Flowering can be increased by thinning the old shoots after flowering[188]. A very polymorphic plant[58]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - sow February in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[78, 175]. Germination is usually good, taking 1 - 3 months at 18°c[78, 175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 12cm with a heel, end of June to July in a frame[11, 78]. Good to high percentage[78]. Cuttings of ripe wood, 20 - 25cm with a heel, either in an outdoor bed if it is sheltered enough, otherwise in a cold greenhouse[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
