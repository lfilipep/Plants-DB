24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[111]. The seed usually germinates in 2 months at 15°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring as new growth commences. Do not allow the plants to become dry either before or after planting[1, 111]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
