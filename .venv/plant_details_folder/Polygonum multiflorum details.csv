3,USDA hardiness,6-9
4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been made for this species, there have been reports that some members of this genus can cause photosensitivity in susceptible people. Many species also contain oxalic acid (the distinctive lemony flavour of sorrel) - whilst not toxic this substance can bind up other minerals making them unavailable to the body and leading to mineral deficiency. Having said that, a number of common foods such as sorrel and rhubarb contain oxalic acid and the leaves of most members of this genus are nutritious and beneficial to eat in moderate quantities. Cooking the leaves will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Anticholesterolemic  Antipyretic  Antispasmodic  Antitumor  Astringent  Cardiotonic  Demulcent  Deobstruent  Hypoglycaemic  Laxative  Sedative  Tonic  UrinaryHe Shou Wu is considered to be one of the most important of the Chinese herbal tonics and is widely used in that country[218]. It is said to restore vitality and virility[174], working especially on the liver and the reproductive, urinary and circulatory systems[238]. Some care should be exercised, however, since excessive doses can cause skin rash and numbness of the extremities[238]. The roots and stems are antibacterial, anticholesterolemic, antispasmodic, astringent, cardiotonic, demulcent, depurative, hypoglycaemic, laxative, sedative, tonic[116, 147, 174, 176, 238, 279]. The roots are taken internally in the treatment of menstrual and menopausal complaints, constipation in the elderly, swollen lymph glands and high cholesterol levels[238]. They are very effective in reducing high cholesterol levels in the blood and increase blood sugar levels[254]. Externally, they are used to treat ringworm, bleeding wounds and sores[238]. The roots are harvested in the autumn, preferably from plants 3 - 4 years old, and are dried for later use[238]. The leaves and roots tonify the liver and kidneys, fortify the blood, strengthen the muscles and prevent premature greying of the hair[218]. The stem is deobstruent and sedative[218]. It is taken internally in the treatment of insomnia and neurasthenia whilst it is applied externally to ringworm[176, 238]. The stems are harvested in late summer or early autumn and are dried for later use[238]. Extracts of the plant have shown antipyretic, antitumour, hypoglycaemic and sedative activity[218]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1] but prefers a moisture retentive not too fertile soil in sun or part shade[200]. Repays generous treatment[1]. This species is hardy to at least -15°c[238]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. There is a suggestion that this plant might be dioecious[178], in which case male and female plants will need to be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually free and easy. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have reached sufficient size. If not, overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out the following spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer."
