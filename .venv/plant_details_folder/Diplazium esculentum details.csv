4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens, so some caution is advisable [200 ]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities, this enzyme will not harm people eating an adequate diet rich in vitamin B, though large amounts can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase [172 ].",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Diplazium esculentum is considered the most important edible fern worldwide, rich in iron, phosphorus, potassium and proteins. Its use as a vegetable is prevalent in Asia and Oceania, and it is widely used in the Himalayas [1-8].  The young leaves are eaten as lalab (a vegetable salad served with sambal) with rice [ 46 ]. The young fronds are boiled and used as a vegetable[ 200 , 317 , 437 ]. They are stir-fried and used in salads. Fronds are blanched, boiled or stir-fried and, in some cases, pickled. Often compared to the flavour of over-cooked asparagus, the young fronds are generally cooked before consumption to avoid bitterness. They can be dried and then reconstituted for cooking.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Diplazium esculentum ferns are a forest under-storey preferring shady, moist conditions. As the ferns spread very vigorously by rhizomes, it is important to plant them in an area that won't cause problems. Diplazium esculentum is a plant of the humid tropics[611]. In its native habitat, Diplazium esculentum grows in wet valleys, sheltered spots in dry areas, open places on damp ground, marshy areas, secondary forests, rainforests and by riverbanks and canals at elevations from sea level to 2300m. A cold-sensitive plant suitable for the warmer regions and tender to freezing temperatures. Light: Part Sun, Filtered Shade, Shade. Drainage: Well-drained, Moist soil. Soil pH: mildly acid to mildly alkaline. It grows best when organic matter is abundant in the soil [200]. Special soil tolerances: infertile.",
26,Plant Propagation,Spores - they germinate readily and develop quickly[200 ]. Division of plantlets that are produced at the roots[200 ].,
