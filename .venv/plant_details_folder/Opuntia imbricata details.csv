0,Opuntia imbricata,Tree Chola,Cactaceae,8-11,The plant has numerous minutely barbed glochids (hairs) that are easily dislodged when the plant is touched and they then become stuck to the skin where they are difficult to see and remove. They can cause considerable discomfort[200].,Sandy to gravelly soils[228].,South-western N. America.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/OpuntiaImbricata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/OpuntiaImbricata2.jpg",Opuntia imbricata (Haw.) DC. is now classified as a synonym of Cylindropuntia imbricata (Haw.) F.M.Knuth,"Opuntia imbricata is an evergreen Perennial growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil and can tolerate drought.",Opuntia imbricata (Haw.) DC. is a synonym of Cylindropuntia imbricata (Haw.) F.M.Knuth,Cultivated Beds; East Wall. By. South Wall. By.,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"Pads - cooked or raw[257]. Watery and very mucilaginous[85]. The prickles on the skin must be carefully removed before eating the pads. The young pads can be split lengthways then dried and stored for winter use[257]. Fruit - raw, cooked or dried for later use[257]. Sweet and gelatinous[85]. Lean and insipid[95]. The unripe fruits can be added to soups etc, imparting an okra-like mucilaginous quality[183]. The fruit can hang on the plant all year round[160]. Be careful of the plants irritant hairs, see the notes above on toxicity. The fruits of O. imbricata are dry, about 3cm in diameter and usually free of spines[200, 227]. Seed - briefly roasted then ground into a powder[62]. It is also used as a thickener[62].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Mordant: Used for making a dye more permanent, it also affects the colour of the dye.,Needles: Used for sewing, darning etc.","The fruit is chopped into small pieces, boiled and then the fibre and seed is filtered out. The resulting liquid is used as a mordant for dyes[227]. The thorns have been used as a sewing material and for tattooing[257]. The dried stems have been used as candles and torches[257]. The following notes are for O. ficus indica. They almost certainly also apply to this species[K]. A gum is obtained from the stem. It is used as a masticatory or mixed with oil to make candles[64]. The juice of the boiled stem segments is very sticky. It is added to plaster, whitewash etc to make it adhere better to walls[92].",,Requires a sandy or very well-drained soil[160]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 to 7.5[200]. Plants must be kept fairly dry in the winter but they like a reasonable supply of water in the growing season[200]. A position at the base of a south-facing wall or somewhere that can be protected from winter rain is best for this plant. Requires warmth and plenty of sun. Plants tolerate considerable neglect. This species is fairly cold tolerant and can succeed outdoors in a selected site in the milder areas of the country[200].,"Seed - sow early spring in a very well-drained compost in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from winter wet. Make sure you have some reserve plants in case those outdoors do not overwinter. Cuttings of leaf pads at any time in the growing season. Remove a pad from the plant and then leave it in a dry sunny place for a couple of days to ensure that the base is thoroughly dry and has begun to callous. Pot up into a sandy compost. Very easy, rooting quickly.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
