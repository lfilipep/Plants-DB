13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rosa virginiana is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.5 m (5ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[177]. The fruit is up to 15mm in diameter[200], but there is only a thin layer of flesh surrounding the many seeds[K]. Some care has to be taken when eating this fruit, see the notes above on known hazards. The buds are eaten by native Indians in N. America[161, 177, 183]. No further details are given, does this refer to the leaf or flower buds? The seed is a good source of vitamin E, it can be ground into a powder and mixed with flour or added to other foods as a supplement[102, 183]. Be sure to remove the seed hairs[102].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Cancer  Haemostatic  OphthalmicA decoction of the roots has been used as a bath and to treat worms in children[257]. An infusion of the roots has been drunk and used as a wash in treating bleeding cuts on the feet[257]. An infusion of the roots has been used as a wash to treat sore eyes[257]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].",
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Can be grown as a hedge, succeeding in windy positions[1, 11]. The suckering form of this species can be used to fix sand dunes[11]. It also makes a good ground cover[245].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, preferring one on the dryish side[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a circumneutral soil and a sunny position[200]. Dislikes water-logged soils. Does well in a windy position[11]. Grows well with alliums, parsley, mignonette and lupins[18, 20]. Garlic planted nearby can help protect the plant from disease and insect predation[18, 20]. Grows badly with boxwood[18]. The flowers are fragrant[245]. The form in cultivation in Britain is very invasive, forming thickets with its suckers, whilst the wild form does not produce suckers[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[80]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat[80]. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate[80]. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested[80]. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°c[200]. It may take 2 years to germinate[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July in a shaded frame. Overwinter the plants in the frame and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth. Select pencil thick shoots in early autumn that are about 20 - 25cm long and plant them in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[78, 200]. The cuttings can take 12 months to establish but a high percentage of them normally succeed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Layering. Takes 12 months[11].",
