Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Parasiticide  Stimulant  Stomachic  TonicThe root and the seeds are antispasmodic, aromatic, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, stimulant, stomachic, and tonic[7, 13, 21, 147, 218]. This plant is less rich in active principles than A. archangelica and so is much less used medicinally than that species[9, 244], but a decoction is sometimes used in the treatment of bronchial catarrh, coughs and dyspepsia[9]. Large doses have the effect of depressing the central nervous system[7]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[200]. Succeeds in deep shade. Plants are reliably perennial if they are prevented from setting seed[200].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in situ as soon as it is ripe."
