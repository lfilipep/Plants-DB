Plants are reliably perennial if they are prevented from setting seed[200].,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in situ as soon as it is ripe.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
