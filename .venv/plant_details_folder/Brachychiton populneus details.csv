24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen. Prefers a well-drained moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Succeeds in most soils, tolerating dry soils in Australian gardens[157, 167]. Plants dislike wet soils, especially in the winter[K]. Requires a minimum temperature of 7 - 10°c[188, 200]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. This plant is very doubtfully hardy outdoors in Britain, though plants in an unheated greenhouse survived a prolonged cold period in 1996 - 97 when temperatures sometimes went down to -8°c[K]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth."
