It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 28c, but can tolerate 9 - 32c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,300 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,500mm[ 418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in dappled shade[ 418 ]. Grows best in a fertile, heavy soil[ 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5.5 - 7.5[ 418 ]. Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[ K ]. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying.",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
