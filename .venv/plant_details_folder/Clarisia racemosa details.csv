The heartwood is bright yellow, becoming brown or russet, but retaining a golden lustre upon exposure; it is sharply demarcated from the 2 - 5cm wide band of white sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse; the grain variable, often decidedly roey with an attractive figure; dry specimens are without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is moderately heavy, moderately hard; very durable, but not if in contact with the soil, being very resistant to attacks by dry wood borers and termites. It seasons normally, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable to stable in service. It is easy to work, though has a high blunting effect so stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it is rated fair to good in all machining operations; cross-grained material requires sharp tools to produce a smooth surface; fresh wood saws woolly; it does not take nails and screws well; glues and stains satisfactorily. A valued timber, it can be used for a wide range of purposes including making high-class furniture, cabinet work, panelling, joinery, tool handles, flooring, general construction and laminates[ 316 , 341 , 625 , 848 ].",,"Young plants grow best in the dappled shade of the woodland, becoming more light tolerant as they grow larger[ 625 ]. Prefers a clayey soil[ 625 ]. Young trees have a moderate rate of growth[ 625 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[ 625 ].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in individual containers - placing 2 - 3 seeds in each container. A low germination rate can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 40 - 60 days[ 625 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
