22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a free-draining, light, sandy, acid soil with additional leafmould added[200]. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain[200]. It can be grown in areas where frosts are light and of short duration, otherwise it will require some protection from winter cold[200]. The flowers are very fragrant[82, 200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species, but the seed is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out in early summer when there is no danger of frost. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a sandy medium in a frame[200]."
