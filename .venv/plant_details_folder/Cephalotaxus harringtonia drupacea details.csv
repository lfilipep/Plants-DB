13,Summary,"Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Spreading or horizontal."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cephalotaxus harringtonia drupacea is an evergreen Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

19,Edible Uses Description,"t. - raw or cooked[177]. The fruit closely resembles a plum in its structure, the flesh is thick, juicy and very sweet with a hint of pine in its flavour[2, 183]. The fruit is about 2 - 3cm long[200]. The fruit does not always ripen in Britain, before full ripeness it has a disgusting resinous flavour that coats the mouth and refuses to go away for hours[K]. Seed - raw or cooked[81, 105]. Oily[1]. The seed has a firm texture and a slightly resinous flavour[K]."

23,Other Uses Description,"An oil obtained from the seed is used as an illuminant[105]. Very tolerant of pruning, this plant makes a very good hedge in shady positions[200]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Hedge, Massing, Screen, Woodland garden. Prefers a moist well-drained sandy soil but succeeds in most soils though it dislikes dry gravelly or chalky soils[1, 200]. Prefers a position in semi-shade but tolerates full shade[11, 81] and it also succeeds but does not usually thrive in full sun[200]. It grows very well in the mild wet coastal region of W. Scotland where it succeeds even in full sun[200]. Requires a humid sheltered site[200], strongly disliking very exposed positions[1]. Although the dormant plant is very cold-hardy, the young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. The Japanese plum yew is a very slow growing tree[185] with an excellent potential as a food crop in Britain. This subspecies is growing very well in the shade of other conifers at Kew botanical gardens, where it fruits regularly and heavily. Both the fruit and the seed are edible, these are often eaten in Japan. In addition, the seeds seem to be immune to the predations of squirrels. The seed on trees growing at Kew Botanical gardens are untouched even though virtually every other nut tree there has its crop destroyed[K]. Plants are dioecious, but female plants sometimes produce fruits and infertile seeds in the absence of any male plants[11]. However, at least one male plant for every five females should be grown if you are growing the plants for fruit and seed. Plants have also been known to change sex[81]. Male cones are produced in the axils of the previous year's leaves, whilst female cones are borne at the base of branchlets[200]. There has been some confusion in the naming of this plant. Some botanists have separated it off as a separate species, C. drupacea, though most nowadays include it as a subspecies of C. harringtonia, differing from the species in its shortly pedunculate male catkins[81]. In cultivation it is often known as the variety 'Fastigiata'[81]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[113], it should then germinate in the following spring[K]. A hard seedcoat can delay germination, especially in if the seed is not sown as soon as it is ripe[81, K]. Stored seed should be cold-stratified and sown in a cold frame in the spring[200]. Germination can take 18 months or more. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter under cover. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Greenwood cuttings of terminal shoots, August/September in a humid cold frame[1, 200]. Difficult[113]."
