The plants are rich in tannin[213], the root containing 10 - 20%[222]. The roots can be harvested in the autumn then dried and stored[213]. It is best to harvest the roots as the plant comes into flower since it is then at its most active medicinally[4]. The leaves are harvested as the plant comes into flower and are dried for later use[238].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Woodland garden. Succeeds in any moderately fertile retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates a wide range of soil types[200], including water-logged soils[187]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
