24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light soil[1, 206]. Requires a rich well-drained moisture-retentive soil in full sun[200]. Plants require a well-drained soil but do not need particularly fertile soil[206]. Prefers an acid soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6[206]. The plant is not frost hardy and requires temperatures above 18°c if it is to grow well[206]. The plant requires short days in order to flower[206]. Shiso is often cultivated in the Orient as a food flavouring. This is a very ornamental form of the plant with particularly deep red leaves[74, 206]. Shiso is also cultivated for the oil obtained from its seed[50, 171]. It is sometimes used in sub-tropical bedding schemes in Britain[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Surface-sow or only lightly cover the seed in mid spring in a greenhouse. The seed germinates best at 20°c, though it also succeeds at slightly lower temperatures[206]. Germination is usually quick, prick out the seedlings into trays or individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer[200, K]. Give the plants some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. The seed has a short viability and should be used when less than a year old[206]."
