0,Porteresia coarctata,Wild rice. Uri. Tropical wild rice,Poaceae,10-12,None known,It is a tropical plant. It grows in mangrove forests and in saline estuaries. It grows in coastal places.,"Origin: S. Asia. Native to India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.",(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Water Plants,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Porteresia_coarctata1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Porteresia_coarctata2.JPEG","A form of wild rice that grows in saline estuaries in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar and is harvested and eaten locally. The plant is A salt-tolerant wild rice that grows in saline estuaries. It is as pioneer species in the succession process of mangrove formation along the estuaries of India. May also be known as as Oryza coarctata Roxb.","Porteresia coarctata is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can grow in water.",Indoryza coarctata (Roxb.) A.N.Henry & B.Roy. Oryza coarctata Roxb. Oryza triticoides Griff. Sclerophyllum coarctatum (Roxb.). Griff.,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Edible Portion: Seeds. Perennial grains have been a dream of the sustaiable agriculture movement for some time promising to marry the carbon and agroecological benefits of perennials to the annual staples we know and love. The task of perennializing grains is a slow and laborious process but some progress is being made. Wild rice species have proven to be tremendous gene reservoirs to increase domesticated rice yield, quality, and resistance to diseases and insects. Wild rice species have furnished genes for the hybrid rice revolution, exhibit yield-enhancing traits and have shown tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Among the wild relatives of rice, P. coarctata shows considerable adaptation to salinity. Porteresia coarctata is currently wild-harvested and grown for erosion control and coastal protection. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"Grown for erosion control and coastal protection. The plant is salt-tolerant, and is seen as a possibly important source of salt-tolerance genes for transfer to other rice species. P. coarctata act as pioneer species in the succession process of mangrove formation along the estuaries of India","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbClimate: tropical. Humidity: humid. It is closely related to Oryza australiensis. P. coarctata grows in abundance along the eastern and western coasts of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh shows considerable adaptation to salinity. Porteresia, a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) distant wild rice relative, is a monotypic genus occurring as an associate of mangroves along the coastal belts.
