24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in a rich garden soil if this stays reliably moist in the summer[1]. Requires a wet or moist peaty soil in sun or partial shade[187]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 to 7[200]. Prefers partial shade[200]. The plant is found in sunny habitats in the wild[58]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. Only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 20cm tall. Plant them out in the summer, or late in the following autumn. Division in spring. This is best done every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain the vigour of the plant[200]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well."
