In this ecological community, you'll typically see Hay-scented Ferns growing among wildflowers such as goldenrods, hawkweeds, dandelions, Oldfield Cinquefoil, Common Evening Primrose, Field Chickweed, New England Aster, and Queen Anne's Lace. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length  [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Propagate by spores or rhizome division. Cut rhizomes between fronds, set apart and trim back at least half of each frond.",
