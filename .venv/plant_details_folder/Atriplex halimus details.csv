13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Atriplex halimus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in July. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems."
19,Edible Uses Description,"s - raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 177]. Some forms are eaten raw[177]. A famine food according to one report[177], but in our opinion it is far from being a famine food, in fact this is one of the more popular crops being grown at 'The Field' at present (1993)[K]. The leaves have a very nice rather salty flavour, they go well in salads or can be cooked like spinach[K]. When lightly steamed, the leaves retain their crispness and are a delicious spinach substitute[K]. The leaves retain their salty flavour even when grow inland in non-salty soils[K]. The leaves can be used at any time of the year though winter harvesting must be light because the plant is not growing much at this time[K]. Seed - cooked[85]. It can be ground into a meal and used as a thickener in soups, or mixed with cereals in making bread. The seed is small and fiddly. The plant is said to yield an edible manna[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CarminativeThe shoots are burnt to produce an antacid powder[238].
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps. Does not include the essential oils, dyes and oils that are also used in making soap.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility."
23,Other Uses Description,"The ash from the burnt plant is used as the alkali in making soap[46, 61]. The plant makes a superb wind-resistant low-growing hedge that can be allowed to grow untrimmed or can be trimmed[K]. It is especially valuable in maritime areas, succeeding right on the coast, though can also be used inland[75, 182, K]. The plant is extremely tolerant of pruning and can regrow even when cut back into old wood[K]. The plant draws salt out of the soil and so has been used in soil-reclamation projects to de-salinate the soil[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in full sun in any well-drained but not too fertile soil[182, 200]. Tolerates saline and very alkaline soils[200]. Succeeds in dry soils including pure sands[49, 75]. Plants will grow in semi-shade, though they will soon become leggy in such a position, they are really best in full sun[K]. A very wind hardy plant, it is resistant to salt-laden gales[75], and can be used as a hedge in maritime areas[182]. Plants dislike very wet climates[K]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. This plant is hardier than the foregoing report suggests, it grows well at Hilliers Arboretum in Hampshire where temperatures can fall somewhat lower than -10°c[K]. Plants can be damaged by severe frosts but they soon recover[11]. Resents root disturbance when large[134]. Plants are apt to succumb to winter wet when grown on heavy or rich soils[182]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 7. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April/May in a cold frame in a compost of peat and sand. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 weeks at 13°c[134]. Pot up the seedlings when still small into individual pots, grow on in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. The seed is seldom formed[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy. Pot up as soon as they start to root (about 3 weeks) and plant out in their permanent positions late in the following spring[K]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November/December in a frame. Very easy. Pot up in early spring and plant out in their permanent position in early summer[K]."
