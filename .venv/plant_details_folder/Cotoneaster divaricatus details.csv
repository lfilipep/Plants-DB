See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, midges. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,,"Industrial Crop: Dye: Botanical dyes replacing synthetic dyes (known as heavy polluters).,Industrial Crop: Tannin: Occur generally in the roots, wood, bark, leaves, and fruit of many plants.

Plants are often used in informal hedging[200].,,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a good soil but also does well in poor soils[1, 11, 200]. It thrives in lime and is also happy in peaty soils[1]. It succeeds in any soil that is not marshy or waterlogged[11, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade but does not fruit so freely in a shady position[11, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A very hardy species, tolerating temperatures down to at least -15°c[202]. Fairly fast-growing[202]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The flowers, when inhaled near to, have an unpleasant smell like decaying fish[245]. They are very attractive to bees whilst the fruit is a good winter food source for many species of birds[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed. Members of this genus hybridize freely so, if you require seed that breeds true, it is important to obtain it from a known wild source or from a controlled fertilization of garden plants. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it will usually germinate in the spring[11, 200]. Stored seed germinates faster if given 3 months warm stratification at 15°c and then 3 months cold stratification at 4°c[164]. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 18 months at 15°c but it can take 2 years[164]. Pot the seedlings up as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into nursery beds or into their permanent positions when they are more than 10cm tall.
