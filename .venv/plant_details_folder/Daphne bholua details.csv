See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",D. cannabina. pro parte.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  FebrifugeThe juice of the roots, combined with molasses, is used in the treatment of fevers and intestinal problems[272]. A decoction of the bark is used to treat fevers[272]. The powdered seeds are anthelmintic[272].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.","A very good quality paper is made from the inner bark[11, 46, 51, 61, 272]. It is one of the principle sources of hand made paper in Nepal[272]. The fibre in the inner bark can be used to make rope[146, 272].",,"Prefers a cool lime-free well-drained sandy loam and a sunny position[1, 11]. Succeeds in neutral soils[11] and tolerates partial shade[200]. Plants also succeed in quite deep shade[219]. At least some forms, especially the sub-species D. bholua glacialis.(see below) tolerate alkaline soils[184]. Flowers well when grown in dry shade[184]. Likes plenty of moisture in the growing season[11]. Grows well in London, tolerating atmospheric pollution[184]. Said to be hardy to about -5°c[200], plants succeed outdoors in southern England, but are defoliated in severe winters[11]. Plants at higher altitudes in its native range are often deciduous whilst plants from lower altitudes are evergreen but less hardy[166]. A very variable and very ornamental species[1, 200], the cultivars 'Ghurka' (deciduous) and 'Jacqueline Postill' (evergreen) are more hardy than the type[182, 200]. One report says that the cultivar 'Ghurka' is part of the deciduous sub-species D. bholua glacialis. (W.W.Smith.&Cave.)Burtt. and that it can tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. The flowers are fragrant[272]. Because it flowers in the winter, this species seldom produces much seed in Britain unless it is hand-pollinated[214]. Plants often sucker and form clumps in the wild[214]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, June/July in a frame[214].
