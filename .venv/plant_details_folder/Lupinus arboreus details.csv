0,Lupinus arboreus,"Tree Lupin, Yellow bush lupine",Fabaceae or Leguminosae,7-10,"The seed of many lupin species contain bitter-tasting toxic alkaloids, though there are often sweet varieties within that species that are completely wholesome[65, 76]. Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65].","Stable sand dunes, coastal scrub and pine forest close to the coast. Naturalized by the sea in S. England[184].",South-western N. America - California to Oregon. Naturalized in S.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.","A bright yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. The root fibres have been used to make a string for making nets etc[257]. Plants are used in land reclamation schemes to stabilize sandy soils and dunes[200]. Because they are fast growing and tolerant of maritime exposure, they quickly provide shelter for other plants as well as enriching the soil with nitrogen[K]. An excellent pioneering plant in permaculture, even in exposed areas it grows rapidly to its maximum height of about 1.5 metres and will give shelter to enable other less tolerant plants to become established. It is especially useful for helping the establishment of shrubs and herbaceous perennials in small gardens[K].",,"Requires a well-drained dry or moist soil in a sunny position[11, 182]. Prefers an alkaline soil[188]. Grows well near the coast[11], resisting maritime exposure. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Hardy to about -15°c[184, 200]. Plants are hardy in all but severe winters in Britain[200], though they become less hardy with age[11]. A fast-growing but short-lived plant[182], especially when growing in rich soils[11]. Plants have reached 2.7 metres tall and wide within 4 years from seed in a rich soil, flowering and producing seed prolifically[11]. Plants self-sow when in a suitable position[200]. The flowers bear the fragrance of white clover[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a greenhouse[1, 200]. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. It should also be possible to sow the seed in situ in mid to late spring. Protect the seed from mice.
