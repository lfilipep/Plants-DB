Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Galactogogue  Kidney  Poultice  TonicSkeleton weed was employed medicinally by various native North American Indian tribes who used it particularly as a galactogogue[213, 257]. It is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. The leaves and stems are galactogogue and tonic[213, 257]. An infusion of the stems has been used to promote milk flow in nursing mothers, in the treatment of smallpox, measles, kidney problems, diarrhoea, heartburn and burning coughs and also as a general tonic for children[257]. A poultice of the plant has been applied to bring relief to rheumatic and swollen joints[257]. An infusion has been used as a wash for sore eyes[257]. An infusion of the powdered galls that are found on the plant is diuretic[257]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most areas of the country. It is likely to require a sunny position in a light well-drained soil."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division can be tried in the spring."
