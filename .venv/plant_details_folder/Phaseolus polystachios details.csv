0,Phaseolus polystachios,Thicket Bean. Wild bean,Fabaceae,6-10,"We have seen no specific reports for this species, but the mature seed of most, if not all, members of this genus contain various anti-nutritional factors. Soaking the seeds, discarding the water and then boiling them and discarding the water will remove these toxins and render the seeds safe and nutritious[K Plants for a Future Author Ken Fern Description Notes from observations, tasting etc at Plants For A Future and on field trips. ].","A temperate plant. It grows in dry woods and sandy thickets. Climbing on shrubs and young trees in moist thickets, clearings and edges of deciduous forests, in deep swamps and sometimes on dry sandy, dry shale and rocky hillsides[1555 ].","North America, Mesoamerica.

America - Iowa to Maine, south to Texas and Florida",(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Phaseolus_polystachios1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Phaseolus_polystachios2.JPEG","Phaseolus polystachios is a herbaceous perennial climbing plant. In spite of its common name, it is more closely related to the lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), and it holds potential as a crop wild relative due to its resistance to white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum).","Phaseolus polystachios is a CLIMBER growing to 3 m (9ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Dolichos polystachios L. Phaseolus sinuatus Torr. & A.Gray,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",,"Edible Portion: The seeds are eaten, fresh or dried. Seeds - cooked[1438 ]. The elongate seedpod can be 70mm long and 12 mm wide, containing black, squarish seeds around 6mm long, 6 - 7mm wide and 4mm thick[1555 ]. Carbon farming - Staple Crop: protein.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,Carbon farming - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen.,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Historic Crop: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Historic Crop  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: ProteinClimate: cold temperate to tropical. Humidity: humid. Found in the wild on a range of soils from clays to sands[1555 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: historic crop. Management: standard. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. Herbaceous.","Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have ripened and dried the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
