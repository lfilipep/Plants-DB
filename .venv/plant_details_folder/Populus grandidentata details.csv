13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Populus grandidentata is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower in March, and the seeds ripen in April. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"- boiled[46, 61, 105, 161, 257]. There are no more details but inner bark is often dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereals when making bread.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Febrifuge  TonicThe bark of most, if not all members of the genus contain salicin, a glycoside that probably decomposes into salicylic acid (aspirin) in the body[213, 238]. The bark is therefore anodyne, anti-inflammatory, febrifuge and tonic[4, 238]. It is used especially in treating rheumatism and fevers, and also to relieve the pain of menstrual cramps[238]. An infusion of the bark has been used to ease and lessen menstrual flow[257].",
22,Other Uses,"Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"An excellent pioneer species, establishing well and growing quickly. It provides good growing conditions for other woodland trees. Since this species is intolerant of shade, it will eventually be out-competed by the other trees[229].  - soft, rather woolly in texture, without smell or taste, of low flammability, not durable, very resistant to abrasion[11, 61, 171]. It weighs 29lb per cubic foot[235]. Used mainly for pulp, it makes a high quality paper[11, 61, 123, 171].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Massing. An easily grown plant, it does well in a heavy cold damp soil[1]. Prefers a deep rich well-drained circumneutral soil, growing best in the south and east of Britain[11, 200]. Growth is much less on wet soils, on poor acid soils and on thin dry soils[11]. It does not do well in exposed upland sites[11]. It dislikes shade and is intolerant of root or branch competition[200]. A fast-growing but short-lived tree[229], it does not appear to thrive in Britain[11], though it is extensively planted for timber in Austria[50]. Trees usually produce suckers and form large thickets in the wild[226]. This species is closely related to P. tremula[1]. Poplars have very extensive and aggressive root systems that can invade and damage drainage systems. Especially when grown on clay soils, they should not be planted within 12 metres of buildings since the root system can damage the building's foundations by drying out the soil[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be sown as soon as it is ripe in spring[113]. Poplar seed has an extremely short period of viability and needs to be sown within a few days of ripening[200]. Surface sow or just lightly cover the seed in trays in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame. If sufficient growth is made, it might be possible to plant them out in late summer into their permanent positions, otherwise keep them in the cold frame until the following late spring and then plant them out. Most poplar species hybridize freely with each other, so the seed may not come true unless it is collected from the wild in areas with no other poplar species growing[11]. Cuttings of mature wood in November/December in a sheltered outdoor bed. This species does not root readily from cuttings[200]. Suckers in early spring[78]. Layering in spring[200]. Root cuttings in the winter[200]",
