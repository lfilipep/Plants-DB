22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most good garden soils[1], preferring one that is well-drained and moisture retentive[200]. Prefers a sunny position[200], but it also succeeds in partial shade[233]. Prefers a rich soil[1], but tolerates poor ones[233]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. The crushed plant has a smell like juniper berries[257]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants need to be divided every few years, preferably in the spring, in order to keep the plant vigorous[187]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Attracts butterflies and moths, it is also a good bee plant providing nectar in autumn[30]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
