Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The roots are diaphoretic, emmenagogue and febrifuge[257]. A decoction has been used in the treatment of colds, consumption, typhoid, pneumonia and fevers[257]. A decoction has been used to promote menstruation - this can lead to an abortion[257]. The decoction has also been used to restore a woman to health after giving birth[257]. The chewed root has been applied to an aching tooth to allay the pain[257].",,"Landscape uses: Forest garden, Cottage gardens, Water garden, Wildlife garden, Moist Prairie or Meadow, Perennial borders.

Prefers a sunny position[200], but it also succeeds in partial shade[233]. Prefers a rich soil[1], but tolerates poor ones[233]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. The crushed plant has a smell like juniper berries[257]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants need to be divided every few years, preferably in the spring, in order to keep the plant vigorous[187]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Attracts butterflies and moths, it is also a good bee plant providing nectar in autumn[30].","Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
