They are used externally in the treatment of dermatitis and internally for the treatment of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain, numbness and paralysis[176, 218, 254]. When used in a clinical trial of 171 people, the blood pressure of 81% of the people dropped significantly - this effect was reversed when the treatment was stopped[254]. The plant is normally used in conjunction with Bidens bipinnata[218]. When used with the herb Siegesbeckia pubescens it is anti-inflammatory[254]. The roots and leaves are antirheumatic and hypotensive[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and hypertension[147]. The pounded seed is used to kill lice[218].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Standard, Specimen. Succeeds in a sunny position in ordinary garden soil but prefers a fertile humus-rich well-drained loam[164, 200]. The soil must not be allowed to dry out in the growing season[1]. Requires a position sheltered from cold drying winds[1, 200]. Plants are generally hardy to about -15°c[184, 200], they succeed outdoors at Kew though the branches are pithy and are apt to die back in winter[11]. The sub-species C. trichotomum fargesii. (Dode.)Rehder. is somewhat hardier, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[184]. Plants produce the occasional sucker[182]. The leaves have a heavy unpleasant odour when crushed[11, 182]. Flowers are produced on the current seasons growth and are sweetly scented[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as possible in a greenhouse. Germination can be erratic but usually takes place within 20 - 60 days at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings, 6 - 8cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Very easy, they can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
