Germination can be erratic but usually takes place within 20 - 60 days at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings, 6 - 8cm long, December in a greenhouse. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season.
