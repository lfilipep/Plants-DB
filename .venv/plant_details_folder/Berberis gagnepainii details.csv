18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Fruit - raw or cooked. The fruits are about 10mm long[200].
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  DysenteryBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant makes an impenetrable hedge that can be trimmed or left to its own devices[29, 182, 200]. A yellow dye is obtained from the root."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm moist loamy soil and light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A number of cultivars have been selected for their ornamental value[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely, they resprout well from the base[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]. Suckers, removed in late autumn/early winter and planted out in situ or potted up and planted out in late spring[200]."
