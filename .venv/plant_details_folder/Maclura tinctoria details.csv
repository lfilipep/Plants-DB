23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: A natural pioneer plant in its native range, and supplying food, medicines and commodities, this species should be a good choice as a pioneer for establishing a woodland garden, although its growth rate is only moderate[K ]. Other Uses The wood is valued as a source of dyes[331 ]. The colouring principle, maclurin, gives a yellowish brown or khaki colour much used for military uniforms[331 ]. With other dyes it gives various colours for cotton and silk materials, and also a permanent black[331 ]. All parts of the plant exude a yellow latex when wounded[419 ]. The heartwood is of various shades of yellow to light green, lustrous, becoming reddish or brownish on exposure; it is clearly demarcated from the white sapwood. The texture is usually fine; the grain variable, often interlocked; luster is high; odour and taste are lacking or not distinctive. The wood is hard, heavy, tough, strong, and durable with a fairly straight or somewhat interwoven close grain. It is not very difficult to work, finishes smoothly, and takes a good polish. It is sometimes used in regions where it is plentiful for interior finish, cart wheels, furniture and other purposes[46 , 316 , 331 , 551 ].",
