25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in this country, though judging by its native range it is unlikely to succeed in any but the very mildest areas of the country. This species is not in the IOPI list of accepted plant names."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first 2 winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors.
