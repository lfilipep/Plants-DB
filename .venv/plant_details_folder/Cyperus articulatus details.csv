More recently, interest has grown about the plants possible use in treating conditions such as epilepsy and convulsions. Researchers in Africa have published several studies which suggest that the plant can mediate many of the brain chemical reactions which are required in epilepsy and report that the rhizome has anti-epileptic actions. In addition, other laboratory research reports that the plant has anti-convulsant actions, as well as sedative actions[ 318 ]. The fresh rhizomes are ground up to extract the juice, which is used as a nerve tonic in cases of stress and nervous and mental disorders (including epilepsy). It is also used to treat and prevent a wide range of digestive and gastrointestinal disorders; to treat fevers and flu; to facilitate child birth or to induce an abortion; as a contraceptive; and for throat cancer[ 318 ].
