A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a cold frame or April outdoors. Keep moist and in a shady position until germination takes place[175]. Seed can also be sown either in a cold frame or in situ as soon as it is ripe in mid to late summer[175], though seedlings from the outdoor sowing can be killed in cold winters[K]. The seed has a limited viability so it should be stored in a sealed container at about 3°c[200]. Temperatures above 15°c inhibit germination[175]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 9 weeks at 15°c[175]."
