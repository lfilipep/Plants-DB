See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Dacrydium colensoi. Hook. D. westlandicum.

Requires high rainfall and humidity if it is to succeed[200]. This species tolerates shade and probably requires it in drier areas if the tree is to survive. It requires warm summers if it is to grow well in this country, and even then it is very slow growing[200]. Plants are only hardy in the milder areas of the country[82]. A tree at Borde Hill in Sussex was 2 metres tall in 1970[185]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow spring in a freely draining compost. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Another report says that the seed can be very slow to germinate and that it is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
