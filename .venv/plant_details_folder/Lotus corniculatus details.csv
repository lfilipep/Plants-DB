0,Lotus corniculatus,Bird's Foot Trefoil,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,3-8,"All parts of the plant are poisonous, containing cyanogenic glycosides(hydrogen cyanide)[65, 76]. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death. This species is polymorphic for cyanogenic glycosides[218]. The flowers of some forms of the plant contain traces of prussic acid and so the plants can become mildly toxic when flowering[218]. They are completely innocuous when dried[218].","Pastures and sunny banks of streams, especially on calcareous soils[7, 13, 17].","Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to N. Africa and temperate Asia.",(1 of 5),(4 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LotusCorniculatus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LotusCorniculatus2.jpg","Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Late spring. Form: Irregular or sprawling.","Lotus corniculatus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from June to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Lawn; Meadow;,"Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",,"The young seedpods are 'nibbled'[177]. Caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity.","Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Restorative: Restores consciousness or normal physiological activity.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Cardiotonic  Carminative  Febrifuge  Hypoglycaemic  Restorative  Sedative  Tonic  VermifugeCarminative, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic, restorative, vermifuge[178]. The flowers are antispasmodic, cardiotonic and sedative[7]. The root is carminative, febrifuge, restorative and tonic[218]. The plant is used externally as a local anti-inflammatory compress in all cases of skin inflammation[7].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.","An orange-yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[74]. A useful green manure plant, fixing atmospheric nitrogen[7]. It is difficult to see this plant as a useful green manure, it is fairly slow growing with us and does not produce much bulk[K].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Rock garden. Requires a well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Dislikes shade[200]. Does well on poor soils[61]. An important food plant for many caterpillars[30]. It is also a good bee plant[74], the flowers providing an important source of nectar[240]. The flowers are powerfully scented, even though they are able to pollinate themselves[245]. The plant spreads very freely at the roots[1]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts butterflies. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in the spring or autumn in situ. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 15°c. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
