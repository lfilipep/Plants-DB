Older fruits are cooked, they can be stuffed in much the same way as marrows[ 183 , 196 ]. The fruit has a large cavity in which the seeds develop, and this can be filled with other foods to make kaywa dishes. This may have inspired the local Spanish name pepino de rellenar (""stuffing cucumber""). Mature fruit are cooked with oil and vinegar or added to soups and stews. The fruit is about 6 - 15cm long[ 196 ] and 6cm wide[ 200 ]. Leaves and tender young shoots - cooked and used as greens[ 183 , 284 ]."
