18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world. The annual value of each is more than $1 billion US Examples include coconuts, almonds, and bananas.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Wax: Water resistant, malleable substances. Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Other Systems: Dyke-pond: Aquaforestry integrating, fish, livestock and crops.,Other Systems: Homegarden: Tropical multistrata agroforestry (multi-story combinations of trees, crops, domestic animals in the homestead).,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.FebrifugeThe whole plant is febrifuge, its use stimulates blood circulation[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of 'angry' boils, 'lacquer' sores (probably refers to rashes caused by the sap of Rhus species[K]), dental caries, snakebites, pterygium and traumatic injuries[147].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. One report says that it is no more than a synonym for S. japonica[218]. It quite possible resists maritime exposure.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it might be worthwhile sowing some in situ in April.",
