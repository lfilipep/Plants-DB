13,Summary,"This name is a synonym of Baccharis salicifolia subsp. salicifolia. Baccharis salicifolia is part of a complex that extends through the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America to Argentina and Chile. It is recognized by the narrowly lanceolate, willowlike, finely serrate leaves with acute or acuminate apices, smallish heads in dense clusters, reddish phyllaries, and 5-nerved cypselae. By tagging and measuring individual plants throughout the year, D. H. Wilken (1972) demonstrated that Baccharis salicifolia has distinct seasonal forms. The North American plants were once known as Baccharis glutinosa or Baccharis viminea, which were differentiated from each other by differences in woodiness, leaf size and serration, and flowering time[270 ].",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Baccharis viminea is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft 1in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it requires an almost frost-free climate and tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants respond well to trimming[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - no pre-treatment is required[113]. Surface sow in pots a cold frame in the spring, do not let the compost dry out. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 2 weeks[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[K]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, November in a frame. Easy[K].",
