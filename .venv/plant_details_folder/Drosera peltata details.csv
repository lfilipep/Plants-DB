22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sandy peaty soil, succeeding in poor soils and in bogs[200]. An insectivorous plant, it can survive in nitrogen poor soils because it gets the nutrients it needs from insects[1, 200]. The upper surfaces of leaves are covered with hairs that secrete a sweet sticky substance[7].This attracts insects, which become smeared with it and unable to escape - the plant then exudes a digestive fluid that enables it to absorb most of the insect into its system[7]. A highly variable species in the wild[266]. This sundew is not very hardy in Britain and is best treated as a greenhouse plant[1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a free-draining soil with some charcoal added and with a layer of finely chopped sphagnum moss on top[175]. Surface sow and keep the compost moist. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
