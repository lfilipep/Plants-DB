It is also considered to be analgesic, aphrodisiac, diaphoretic, emetic, emmenagogue, stimulant and tonic[218]. The bark is abortifacient[240]. The juice from the bark is used in the treatment of indigestion[272]. The seed is aphrodisiac, bitter, emetic, laxative and stimulant[240]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism, leprosy, gout, fevers and paralysis[240, 272]. The oil from the seed is a powerful stimulant. It is used in the treatment of beriberi[240]. Many plants in this genus contain compounds of interest for their antitumour activity[218].","Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The seed contains 52% oil, and the fruit 30%[240]. This oil is used medicinally (see notes above), we do not know if it has any other applications[K].",,"Prefers a deep loamy soil[11]. A gross feeder, it requires a rich soil[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A rampant climber, it requires ample space and is best grown into an old tree[1, 200]. Fruits best when its top growth is in a sunny position[182]. Plants climb by means of twining and by hooked prickles[182]. They do not normally require pruning[219]. This species is closely related to C. scandens[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - gather when ripe, store in dry sand and sow February in a warm greenhouse[78]. Three months cold stratification leads to a higher germination rate[113]. Remove the aril since this inhibits germination[113]. Germination rates are usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in August of the current seasons growth. Takes 12 months[78]. Root cuttings, 6mm thick 25mm long in December. Plant horizontally in pots in a frame[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
