24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil[11]. A gross feeder, it requires a rich soil[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A rampant climber, it requires ample space and is best grown into an old tree[1, 200]. Fruits best when its top growth is in a sunny position[182]. Plants climb by means of twining and by hooked prickles[182]. They do not normally require pruning[219]. This species is closely related to C. scandens[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - gather when ripe, store in dry sand and sow February in a warm greenhouse[78]. Three months cold stratification leads to a higher germination rate[113]. Remove the aril since this inhibits germination[113]. Germination rates are usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in August of the current seasons growth. Takes 12 months[78]. Root cuttings, 6mm thick 25mm long in December. Plant horizontally in pots in a frame[78].",
