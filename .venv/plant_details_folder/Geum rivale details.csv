See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to September, and the seeds ripen from June to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; Hedgerow; Bog Garden;,,"Chocolate: substitutes for chocolate, that is.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.","rinkThe dried or fresh root can be boiled in water to make a delicious chocolate-like drink[85, 95, 106, 183, 213]. It can also be used as a seasoning[102, 183]. It is best harvested in the spring or autumn but can be used all year round[213]. Fragrant[161], it was once used to flavour ales[2, 183].","Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antiinflammatory  Antiseptic  Aromatic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  Stomachic  Styptic  TonicThe root is anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic, febrifuge, stomachic, styptic and tonic[4, 21]. An infusion is taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea (and is suitable for children to use), intestinal and stomach complaints, liver disorders etc, it is also applied externally as a wash to various skin afflictions - it is said to remove spots, freckles and eruptions from the face[4, 9]. This plant has similar properties but is less active than the related G. urbanum and so is seldom used medicinally[9, 238]. The root is best harvested in the spring, since at this time it is most fragrant[4]. Much of the fragrance can be lost on drying, so the root should be dried with great care then stored in a cool dry place in an airtight container, being sliced and powdered only when required for use[4]. The root is rich in tannin and is a powerful astringent[213, 222].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The dried root repels moths. Plants are suitable for ground cover when spaced about 30cm apart each way[208]. The cultivar 'Leonard's Variety' is the best for this purpose[208].,,"Easily grown in any moderately good garden soil that is well-drained[1]. Easily grown in a moist or shady border[28, 187]. Prefers a soil rich in organic matter[200]. Prefers a base rich soil[17]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, especially with G. urbanum[187]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[208, 233]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer' Division in spring or autumn. This should be done every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain the vigour of the plant[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
