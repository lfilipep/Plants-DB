0,Rumex bucephalophorus,red dock,Polygonaceae,Coming soon,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Sandy and rocky places, especially by the sea[50].",Europe - Mediterranean.,(1 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexBucephalophorus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexBucephalophorus2.jpg",,"Rumex bucephalophorus is a ANNUAL/PERENNIAL.
