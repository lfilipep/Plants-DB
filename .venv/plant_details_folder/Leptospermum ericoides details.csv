24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in almost any neutral or acid soil of good or reasonable quality, preferring a light sandy loam and full sun[200]. Grows best in an acid sandy soil[260]. Prefers a position sheltered from hot or cold drying winds[200]. This species is not very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c, though there are montane forms that might be hardier[260]. It only succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[200]. Resentful of root disturbance, plants should be pot grown and planted out in their final positions as soon as possible[200]. The flowers have a delicate sweet perfume[245]. Plants do not regenerate from old wood[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. The seed remains viable for many years. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, early August in a frame. Over-winter in the greenhouse for its first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 4 - 5 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. Good percentage[78]."
