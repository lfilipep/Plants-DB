24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist loamy soil[1]. Grows well in marshy soils[24]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. A good plant for the summer meadow[24]. It spreads rapidly by means of runners and is often a weed in lawns or gardens. A polymorphic species, there is at least one named variety. 'Flore Pleno' is a double-flowered form that does not spread by runners and so is unlikely to become a nuisance in the garden[187]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in situ. You are very unlikely to need to encourage this plant. Division in spring. Very easy, though probably totally unnecessary, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",
