It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",C. lanceolatus.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Bog Garden; South Wall. By. West Wall.

Other members of this genus can also be used[168]. A cinnamon dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. Other members of this genus can also be used[168].  - hard, heavy, tough, close grained, but too small for economic use. Used for tool handles etc[154]. It is also used for fuel[272].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Espalier, Pollard, Screen, Standard, Specimen. Succeeds in any soil, tolerating both water-logging and drought[260]. Requires a fertile well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds in a hot position in dry soils. Accepts very wet conditions in Australian gardens[157]. Prefers an acid soil, not doing very well on chalk[182]. This species requires cold greenhouse treatment in most of Britain but it is possibly hardy in the milder areas of the country although even there it is best grown against a wall[1, 11]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157]. Another report says that it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c in Britain[184] and grows well in warm positions in southern gardens. Small-leaves forms of the plant are hardier than the type and can tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c[260]. The cultivar 'Splendens' is said to be particularly good in Britain and is possibly more hardy than the type[202]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning, even old plants will regenerate if pruned back hard into the old wood[K]. The species C. linearis, C. rigidus and C. subulatus are all closely allied to this species and are somewhat hardier[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The leaves vary considerably in shape and are lemon scented[182, 184]. The leaves, when pressed, emit a refreshing scent of lemon[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - surface sow in February in a shaded part of the greenhouse[78]. Cover with paper and stand the pots in a few centimetres of water until germination takes place[200]. Remove from the water tray as soon as the seed germinates. Seedlings are prone to damp off and must be watered with care and kept well ventilated[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood,7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame.
