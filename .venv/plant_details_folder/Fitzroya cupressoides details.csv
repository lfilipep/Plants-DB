See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",F. patagonica.

It is used for construction, carpentry, musical instruments etc[46, 61, 139].",,"This species dislikes soils that dry out rapidly, preferring an acid soil with a pH around 5[200]. It grows best in humid conditions, especially on north facing slopes or in the shelter of a woodland edge[200]. It dislikes cold drying winds[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it is much hardier in Britain than was once thought[11]. Generally a very slow growing tree in Britain but young plants can grow 30cm a year and growth can continue until October[185]. A very slow growing and long-lived tree in its native habitat[139, 200], probably to 3000 years or more, but trees are unlikely to survive that long in Britain[200]. Plants grow best in the mild and damp maritime climate of south-west and west Britain[185, 200]. Plants can be monoecious or dioecious, though they are more often dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is to be produced, though there is a report that trees rarely produce fertile seed in Britain[200]..","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once they have reached a height of at least 30cm, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[200].
