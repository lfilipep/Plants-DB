0,Prunus caroliniana,"American Cherry Laurel, Carolina laurelcherry, Laurel Cherry,",Rosaceae,7-10,"The leaves and young branches of this species contain considerable quantities of hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Deep, well-drained rich moist bottomlands, bluffs or streambanks[82, 229].","South-eastern N.

It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Laurocerasus caroliniana.

It has a thick skin and a thin dry flesh[82] and is not edible[227]. It is slightly toxic to humans[229]. The fruit is about 13mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.,,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Amenable to trimming, this plant can be grown as a screen and hedge[82, 227]. It can also be used in shelterbelt plantings[200]. A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].  - hard, heavy, strong, close grained[82]. The trees are seldom large enough for the wood to be exploited commercially[229].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Screen, Standard, Street tree, Woodland garden. Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[11, 200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in light shade but fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11, 200]. Prefers some chalk in the soil but apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[11]. Fairly wind-resistant[200]. One report says that this species is tender in most of Britain[11], whilst another says that it succeeds in climatic zone 7 (tolerating frosts down to about -15°c)[200]. A fast-growing but short-lived tree[229]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200].
