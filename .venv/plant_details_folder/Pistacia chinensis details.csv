Any pruning that needs to be done is best carried out in the spring[238]. This species strongly resents being transplanted[113], it should be planted out into its permanent position as young as possible and given some protection from winter cold for its first few winters outdoors. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 16 hours in alkalized water[78], or for 3 - 4 days in warm water[1], and sow late winter in a cold frame or greenhouse[78, 113]. Two months cold stratification may speed up germination, so it might be better to sow the seed in early winter[113]. The germination is variable and can be slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving some protection from winter cold for their first year or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood from juvenile trees, July in a frame[113]. Layering.",
