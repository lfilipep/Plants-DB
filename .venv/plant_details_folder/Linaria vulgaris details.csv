21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiphlogistic  Astringent  Cathartic  Detergent  Diuretic  Hepatic  Homeopathy  Ophthalmic  PurgativeYellow toadflax has a long history of herbal use. It acts mainly on the liver and was once widely employed as a diuretic in the treatment of oedema[238]. It is little used now, but undoubtedly merits investigation[238]. The whole plant is antiphlogistic, astringent, cathartic, detergent, depurative, diuretic, hepatic, ophthalmic and purgative[4, 7, 9, 21]. It is gathered when just coming into flower and can be used fresh or dried[4, 238]. The plant is especially valued for its strongly laxative and diuretic activities[4]. It is employed internally in the treatment of oedema, jaundice, liver diseases, gall bladder complaints and skin problems[4, 222, 238]. Externally it is applied to haemorrhoids, skin eruptions, sores and malignant ulcers[238]. The plant should be used with caution. It should preferably only be prescribed by a qualified practitioner and should not be given to pregnant women[238]. Dosage is critical, the plant might be slightly toxic[21, 238]. The fresh plant, or an ointment made from the flowers, is applied to piles, skin eruptions etc[4, 222]. The juice of the plant, or the distilled water, is a good remedy for inflamed eyes and cleaning ulcerous sores[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and cystitis[9].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Insecticide: Kills insects.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow dye is obtained from the whole plant[7, 13]. It is obtained from the flowers according to other reports[4, 100]. A tea made from the plant has been used as an insecticide[222]. A good bee plant[24]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a moderately good well-drained soil[1]. Grows best in a neutral to alkaline soil[238]. It prefers a sunny position[111] but also succeeds in semi-shade[219]. A very drought resistant plant once established[200], it can be grown in a drystone wall[219]. Plants can spread fairly aggressively at the roots when they are in a suitable position[K]. They also often self-sow freely[238].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in situ. Division in April or the autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. This species can be divided successfully at almost any time in the growing season.",
