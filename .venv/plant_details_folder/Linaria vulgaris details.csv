It acts mainly on the liver and was once widely employed as a diuretic in the treatment of oedema[238]. It is little used now, but undoubtedly merits investigation[238]. The whole plant is antiphlogistic, astringent, cathartic, detergent, depurative, diuretic, hepatic, ophthalmic and purgative[4, 7, 9, 21]. It is gathered when just coming into flower and can be used fresh or dried[4, 238]. The plant is especially valued for its strongly laxative and diuretic activities[4]. It is employed internally in the treatment of oedema, jaundice, liver diseases, gall bladder complaints and skin problems[4, 222, 238]. Externally it is applied to haemorrhoids, skin eruptions, sores and malignant ulcers[238]. The plant should be used with caution. It should preferably only be prescribed by a qualified practitioner and should not be given to pregnant women[238]. Dosage is critical, the plant might be slightly toxic[21, 238]. The fresh plant, or an ointment made from the flowers, is applied to piles, skin eruptions etc[4, 222]. The juice of the plant, or the distilled water, is a good remedy for inflamed eyes and cleaning ulcerous sores[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9].

They also often self-sow freely[238].","Seed - sow early spring in situ. Division in April or the autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well.
