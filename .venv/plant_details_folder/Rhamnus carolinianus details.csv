Prefers a moist moderately fertile soil in sun or partial shade[200]. One report suggests that the plant might not be very hardy in Britain[11], whilst another says that it is in climatic zone 6 and thus tolerates temperatures down to about -15°c[200]. A slow-growing and usually short-lived plant in the wild[229]. Plants are susceptible to 'crown rust' of oats[149]. The species in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species is closely related to R. purshiana[11]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed will require 1 - 2 months stratification at 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame. Layering in early spring[4]."
