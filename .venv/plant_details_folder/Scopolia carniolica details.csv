It is used internally in the treatment of chronic diarrhoea, dysentery, stomach ache and manic-depressive states[238]. A very toxic plant, it should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and normally processed for extraction of the alkaloids which are used in the pharmaceutical industry[238].

Germination is quick and easy[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer[K]. Division in spring[188]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
