It causes a sleep that resembles normal sleep[4]. The medicinal activity of this plant resembles belladonna (Atropa belladonna) but it is more narcotic[46]. It is used internally in the treatment of chronic diarrhoea, dysentery, stomach ache and manic-depressive states[238]. A very toxic plant, it should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and normally processed for extraction of the alkaloids which are used in the pharmaceutical industry[238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Scopolia carniolica for liver & gallbladder complaints (see [302] for critics of commission E)."

23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light, fertile, well-drained dry soil in a shady position[1, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is occasionally cultivated for its medicinal uses[46]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[K]. The seed is best sown in the autumn[188]. Germination is quick and easy[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer[K]. Division in spring[188]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
