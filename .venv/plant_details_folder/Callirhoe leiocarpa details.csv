24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Prefers a light rich sandy loam and a sunny position[1]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[200]. A polymorphic species[1]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be planted into their final positions as soon as possible[138]. Slugs are strongly attracted to this plant and can destroy even established plants by eating out all the young shoots in spring[K].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow outdoors or in a cold frame. Plants resent root disturbance so the seed is best sown in situ in April[138], though the slugs will have a field day if you do not protect the plants[K]. If seed is in short supply then sow it in pots in a cold frame, putting a few seeds in each pot, and plant the pots out in early summer once the plants have put on at least 15cm of growth. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138].",
