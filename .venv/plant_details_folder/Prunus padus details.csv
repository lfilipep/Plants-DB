1,Common Name,"Bird Cherry, European bird cherry",
2,Family,Rosaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,3-6,
4,Known Hazards,"The seed and leaves contain hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is readily detected by its bitter taste. Usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm, any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten[19, 65]. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",
5,Habitats,"By streams and in moist open woods[9], usually on alkaline soils[98] but also found on acid soils in upland areas[186].",

14,Physical Characteristics,"Prunus padus is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 5, 13, 46]. The fruit usually has a bitter taste and is used mainly for making jam and preserves[11, 183]. The fruit is about the size of a pea and contains one large seed[200]. Flowers - chewed[177, 183]. Young leaves - cooked[177]. Used as a boiled vegetable in Korea[183]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity. A tea is made from the bark[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Diuretic  Febrifuge  SedativeThe bark is mildly anodyne, diuretic, febrifuge and sedative[9, 13]. An infusion is used in the treatment of colds, feverish conditions etc[9]. The bark is harvested when the tree is in flower and can be dried for later use[9]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].  - hard, heavy, durable, easy to work, polishes well. It is much valued by cabinet makers[11, 46, 115].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Succeeds in any soil, preferring a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. Very hardy but it does not like exposure to strong winds[186]. A very hardy tree[1, 11], tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[184]. A very ornamental species[1], there are some named varieties[188]. The sub-species P. padus borealis is found in Scandinavia and the mountains of C. Europe. It is a shrub growing only to about 3 metres high[184]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Trees usually produce lots of suckers and will soon regenerate by this method if the main trunk is cut down[186]. This tree is a host for cereal virus vector[98]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Trees only cast a light shade and do not themselves thrive in heavy shade[186]. The fruits are relished by birds and the flowers and leaves attract many insects.  Special Features: Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from runners away from the plant [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood, October/November in a frame. Suckers removed in late winter. Layering in spring.",
