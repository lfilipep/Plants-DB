1,Common Name,"Cycas, Sago Palm"
2,Family,Cycadaceae
3,USDA hardiness,8-12
4,Known Hazards,The plants contain alkaloids of carcinogens and also an amino-acid that causes chronic nervous disorders[200]. Regular consumption of the plant leads to severe health problems and death. This toxic principle can be removed if the food is properly prepared but consumption of the plant still cannot be recommended because its use often means the death of the plant and it is becoming rare in the wild.

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Cycad nuts are edible in some species and used as a famine food once processed. (see individual plants) but many are toxic. They are high in starch.
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.See individual species.
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: starch (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles). Genera to investigate include: Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Microcycas, and Zamia [1-1]. Nearly all cycads fix low amounts of nitrogen. Ornamental - Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Massing, Seashore, Specimen."
24,Cultivation Details,"Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Industrial Crop: Starch: Materials and chemicals include bioplastics, paper, cardboard, solvents, paints, glues etc. Plants are usually pods, starchy fruits, nuts & seeds, starchy trunks.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Hypothetical Crop  Industrial Crop: Starch  Management: StandardCycads (Division Cycadophyta) have adapted throughout the tropics and subtropics. Species for sun and shade, desert, swamp, and rain forest [1-1]. Climate: warm temperate to tropical. Humidity: arid to humid. Long lived but slow growing. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: hypothetical. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, 2cm deep in individual pots which are then sealed in plastic bags to keep them moist until germination takes place. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 25°c[164]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water then treat as above. Division of suckers in the spring."
