It is evergreen and perennial, and grows about 4 - 6 m in height with a clump of large pseudo stems that can be up to 30 cm in diameter. It produces runners along the ground that take roots at each segment to form new plants. The leaves are dark green but light green on the the underside and oblong. The fruits are inedible containing irregular shaped seeds. Abaca fiber or commonly known as Manila hemp is the strongest of the natural fibers. It is highly durable and resistant to salt water damage. It is used in the paper industry and in handcrafts like bags, carpets, furniture, and clothing.","Musa textilis is an evergreen Perennial growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Birds, Bats. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil.

The present zone of successful cultivation lies within the latitudinal range 15°N and 5°S. In the Philippines it is usually grown in regions below 500 metres in elevations but it can be grown in the tropics at altitudes between sea level and 1100 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature falls within the range 20 - 29°c, but can tolerate 16 - 33°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 3,000mm, tolerating 700 - 4,400mm[418 ]. Prefers a sunny position[418 ]. Plants can succeed in most humus-rich, fertile soils, so long as they are well-drained[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, though it can tolerate 4.5 - 8[418 ]. Prefers a position sheltered from strong winds. A perennial plant, growing for 18 - 36 months years before first harvest and with a economical life of 6 - 15 years[418 ].
