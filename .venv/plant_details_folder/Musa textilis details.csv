13,Summary,"Musa textilis or commonly known as Abaca is a banana species native to the Philippines and is mainly cultivated for its fiber. It is evergreen and perennial, and grows about 4 - 6 m in height with a clump of large pseudo stems that can be up to 30 cm in diameter. It produces runners along the ground that take roots at each segment to form new plants. The leaves are dark green but light green on the the underside and oblong. The fruits are inedible containing irregular shaped seeds. Abaca fiber or commonly known as Manila hemp is the strongest of the natural fibers. It is highly durable and resistant to salt water damage. It is used in the paper industry and in handcrafts like bags, carpets, furniture, and clothing.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Musa textilis is an evergreen Perennial growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Birds, Bats. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant is not wind tolerant.",

23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The sclerenchym fibres of the leaf sheaths are used to make ropes for ships and nets that are resistant to salt-water[317 ]. The fibre is also used to make sacks, cloth etc[46 , 317 ]. In Japan it is used for making special paper for the construction of movable room walls[317 ]. With the advent of synthetic fibres, demand for this plant has been reducing, though it is becoming increasingly popular as a source of fibre for pulp[418 ].",

A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Managed Multistem  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: MultistrataA plant of the hot, humid tropics adapted to an average relative humidity of about 80%[418 ]. The present zone of successful cultivation lies within the latitudinal range 15°N and 5°S. In the Philippines it is usually grown in regions below 500 metres in elevations but it can be grown in the tropics at altitudes between sea level and 1100 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature falls within the range 20 - 29°c, but can tolerate 16 - 33°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,800 - 3,000mm, tolerating 700 - 4,400mm[418 ]. Prefers a sunny position[418 ]. Plants can succeed in most humus-rich, fertile soils, so long as they are well-drained[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, though it can tolerate 4.5 - 8[418 ]. Prefers a position sheltered from strong winds. A perennial plant, growing for 18 - 36 months years before first harvest and with a economical life of 6 - 15 years[418 ]. In the Philippines, the annual fibre yield ranges from 0.31 - 1.71 t/ha, while in Ecuador, yields are between 1.5 - 2.5 t/ha[418 ].",
