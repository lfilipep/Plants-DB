Used as a salad or cooking oil317]. Very stable, it does not easily turn rancid[370 ]. It is almost identical with olive oil[301 , 370 ]. Used in cooking and as a colouring for chocolates[301 ]. Traditionally, the oil is extracted by pounding the fruit, boiling it in water and skimming off the oil as it floats on the surface[370 ]. Fruit - a sweet flavour46]. The thin, oily mesocarp has a chocolate-like flavour, and is very popular[355 ]. It is usually soaked before eating to soften the pulp[355 ]. The fleshy fruit can be eaten fried[317 ]. The fruit is about 3cm long and 2cm wide[416 ]. A nutritious protein- and oil-rich beverage (agua de seche) is made from the fruit pulp[46 , 317 ]. It is sometimes made into an alcoholic drink by fermentation[317 ]. A nutritious milk-like beverage is made by mixing the juice of the pulp with manioc meal[301 ]. Seed - cooked[324 ]. Eaten mainly by poor people[324 ]. Leaves - cooked[317 , 763 ]. The apical bud, often known as a 'palm heart', is eaten as a vegetable[763 ]. Eating this bud leads to the death of the tree because it is unable to make side shoots[K ].","Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.,Tonic: Improves general health.

The oil obtained from the fruit is used medicinally[317 ]. It is used as a carrier oil - the wood chips of Schefflera morototoni are steeped in the oil and then the oil is massaged into the back to relieve pain in the vertebral column[348 ]. The oil from the seed is purgative and is also used to treat tuberculosis[739 ].

The fronds of the palm are used for thatching[370 ]. The leaves are used for making walls and baskets[317 , 768 ]. The hair-like fibres of the leaves are used to produce ropes for the navy[317 ]. The spine-like fibres of the leaf sheath are made into darts for the blowpipe[317 , 768 ]. A dark blue dye is obtained from the fruit[317 ]. The wood is utilized for the manufacture of bows and arrow points[317 ]. The trunks are exploited for construction[317 , 768 ]. The wood of the stem is split and used for floors, and for other construction needs[355 ].","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Staple Crop: OilA plant of low to moderate elevations in the humid tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,350 metres[314 , 370 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 21 - 28°c, but can tolerate 17 - 32°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about 5°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 4,000mm, but tolerates 1,500 - 6,300mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position and a moist soil[314 ]. Very young plants require a shady position, becoming more light-demanding as they grow older[418 ].
