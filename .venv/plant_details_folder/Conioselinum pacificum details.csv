The plant produces a root cluster, only the larger roots were removed, the smaller ones being left in the ground to continue growing. The roots were steamed for some hours before being eaten[256]. Some reports say that the roots are sweet and tasty, though others say that they have a strong flavour and can cause diarrhoea[256]. If trying out this plant as a food then caution is advised[256]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. However, judging by its native range it is likely to be hardy in all parts of the country and, judging by its native habitat, is likely to require a well-drained soil and a sunny position. It is also likely to be tolerant of saline soils[K]. One report says that the correct name for this species is C. gmelinii[257]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe if possible. Sow stored seed in early spring. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the young seedlings into individual pots and plant them out once they are 20cm or more tall. Division of the rootstock in the spring. Divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
