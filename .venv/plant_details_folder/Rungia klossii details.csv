24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist tropics, where it is found mainly at elevations from 1,000 - 2,000 metres, though it can also be grown down to sea level[658 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 12 - 17°c, but can tolerate 12 - 29°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 800 - 1,200mm, but tolerates 500 - 2,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a sunny position[418 ]. It prefers a reasonably fertile soil, preferably moist, but will grow in most soils[658 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.2, tolerating 5 - 7[418 ]. The plant grows reasonably slowly[658 ]. The shoot tips and upper leaves can be harvested from about 2 - 4 months after planting out, with harvesting continuing at 1 - 2 monthly intervals for 2 years or more[658 ]. Regular picking keeps the branches short and productive of leaves[658 ]. A commercially cultivated vegetable.  One of the main and most popular greens in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. The tips are picked with 2 - 3 leaves on then, each tip weighing about 0.8g. Total yields can be 2 kg/plant/year. If the plants were spaced at 50cm spacing this would give a yield of 4 kg per square metre of garden[658 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Stem cuttings. The plant is grown from cuttings which are about 25cm long. A clump of stems are sown together - these often already have roots developing from the nodes, or very quickly develop roots. It can be planted at any time of the year[658 ].",
