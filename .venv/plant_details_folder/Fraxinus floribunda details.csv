See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.","na is obtained by incision of the trunk[61, 177]. It is used as a sweetener but is laxative if used in quantity[61, 23].","Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants succeed when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. Plants tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. Closely related to F. ornus[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain but can succeed outdoors in the milder areas[1]. It has a very wide range in the wild and there are probably provenances that will do much better in Britain[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
