It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,Leaves: ,Colouring: edible dyes,"Young leaves - boiled[2, 177, 183]. The old leaves are powdered and used to colour food[105, 177, 183].

Thriving in almost any soil, including chalk and sandy soils, it is particularly suited to dry shaded areas[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Shade tolerant but does not fruit well in such a position[11]. Prefers a well-drained loamy soil[11]. Plants are very tolerant of maritime exposure, succeeding even when grown on the sea shore[166], but they can be killed by cold drying winds[75, 184]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are a number of named varieties[184]. It is only hardy in S. England[11] tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. Plants are more likely to succumb to the cold if they are regularly trimmed (this exposes young growth to the cold), this regular trimming also leads to mildew especially when plants are growing in very dry ground[182]. The Japanese spindle tree is cultivated in Russia and Spain for the latex contained in the root. It is best grown in a dry soil and an open position when being grown for its latex[61, 74]. Plants are often slow to get established. Plants can be susceptible to attacks by caterpillars[182] and are often damaged during the flowering season[11]. They are also a host of the sugar beet fly[49]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[121]. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification, so should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[113]. Seed can take 18 months to germinate[74]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm long taken at a node or with a heel, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood, October in a frame78, 113]. Cuttings will root readily at any time of the year if given bottom heat[1].
