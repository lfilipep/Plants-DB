24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the highland tropics, where it is usually found at elevations of 1,400 - 2,50 metres[196 ]. It can also be grown at lower elevations in subtropical and warm, essentially frost-free temperate areas. Yields of over 100 tonnes per hectare are possible[196 ]. There are several named varieties[301 ]. The plant coppices well[196 ]. Although this species is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), fruits are usually produced parthenocarpically, without the need of pollen for fertilisation[301 , 670 ]. A few viable seeds will often be produced, however, if the flower is pollinated[670 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - unlikely to breed true since this is a hybrid species. Seeds are sometimes produced when the flowers are fertilized, these can be used to propagate the plant. Sow the seed in individual containers or in a nursery seedbed in light shade. Germination can be slow and difficult, taking about 30 days[670 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 4 - 6 months old[670 ]. Cuttings work fairly well and maintain female lines that do not need pollination in order to produce fruit..",
