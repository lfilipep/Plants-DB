It can also be grown at lower elevations in subtropical and warm, essentially frost-free temperate areas. Yields of over 100 tonnes per hectare are possible[196 ]. There are several named varieties[301 ]. The plant coppices well[196 ]. Although this species is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), fruits are usually produced parthenocarpically, without the need of pollen for fertilisation[301 , 670 ]. A few viable seeds will often be produced, however, if the flower is pollinated[670 ].","Seed - unlikely to breed true since this is a hybrid species. Seeds are sometimes produced when the flowers are fertilized, these can be used to propagate the plant. Sow the seed in individual containers or in a nursery seedbed in light shade. Germination can be slow and difficult, taking about 30 days[670 ]. Seedlings can be planted out when 4 - 6 months old[670 ]. Cuttings work fairly well and maintain female lines that do not need pollination in order to produce fruit..",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
