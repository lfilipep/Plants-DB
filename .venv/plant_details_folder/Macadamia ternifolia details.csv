19,Edible Uses Description,"acadamias are eaten fresh, roasted, and in baked goods. They are 7-8% protein. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: oil (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].",

23,Other Uses Description,"Possibly similar uses to similar species which include: agroforestry Uses: The decomposed husk is commonly used in potting soil[303 ]. Other Uses: Macadamia shells may be used as fuel, generating sufficient energy to dry wet, in-shell nuts[303 ]. The oil from the seed is used in cosmetics[307 ]. The green seed hulls contain approximately 14% of tannins[303 ]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Other Systems: multistrata.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Staple Crop: OilClimate: subtropical, tropical highlands. Prefers a fertile, sandy loam to light clay soil slightly acid (pH 5.5–7.0) and well drained. Found on moderate to steeply inclined hillslopes as well as steep slopes at 100–320m (mostly less than 200m) above sea level (asl) in altitude. Can live for over 100 years. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. The species can be found in cultivation. Nut yield 2.2 t/ha. Hybridisation between the Small-fruited Queensland Nut and the Macadamia Nut (M. tetraphylla) has been recorded in Queensland.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a nursery bed[188 ]. The dehusked seed germinates quickly at 25°c[200 ]. Cultivars may be grafted.,
