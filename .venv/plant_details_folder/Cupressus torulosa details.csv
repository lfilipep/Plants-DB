See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The plant is burnt as an incense[51, 158]. The leaves are used[272].  - moderately hard, very durable. Used for general construction[51, 61, 158, 272].",,"Thrives in a well-drained loamy or peaty soil[11]. Prefers cooler wetter summers than other members of this genus[200]. Tolerates poor sandy soils[81] but is then more subject to insect damage in a succession of dry seasons[11]. Requires a sunny position[81]. Subject to injury by the wind. Prefers a pH of 6 or lower[200]. This species is somewhat tender in Britain, succeeding only in the milder areas of the country, though some provenances should prove hardier[81]. Trees are slow growing in most of Britain, though growth is much faster in S.W. England and S. Ireland[185]. This species is planted on a small scale as a timber tree in Italy[50]. Cones can remain closed on the tree for a number of years, opening after the heat of a forest fire to scatter their seeds which then germinate and grow away quickly in the ashes of the fire[200]. The crushed foliage smells of lawn mowings[185]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Three weeks cold stratification can improve germination rates[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c. The seedlings are very subject to damping off so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can store for several years[113]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, September in a frost-proof frame[1]. April/May is the best time to take cuttings[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
