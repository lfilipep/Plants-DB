22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a well-drained loamy or peaty soil[11]. Prefers cooler wetter summers than other members of this genus[200]. Tolerates poor sandy soils[81] but is then more subject to insect damage in a succession of dry seasons[11]. Requires a sunny position[81]. Subject to injury by the wind. Prefers a pH of 6 or lower[200]. This species is somewhat tender in Britain, succeeding only in the milder areas of the country, though some provenances should prove hardier[81]. Trees are slow growing in most of Britain, though growth is much faster in S.W. England and S. Ireland[185]. This species is planted on a small scale as a timber tree in Italy[50]. Cones can remain closed on the tree for a number of years, opening after the heat of a forest fire to scatter their seeds which then germinate and grow away quickly in the ashes of the fire[200]. The crushed foliage smells of lawn mowings[185]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Three weeks cold stratification can improve germination rates[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c. The seedlings are very subject to damping off so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can store for several years[113]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, September in a frost-proof frame[1]. April/May is the best time to take cuttings[113].",
