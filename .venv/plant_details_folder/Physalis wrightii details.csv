24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though it should be possible to treat it as a tender annual, sowing the seed in early spring in a warm greenhouse and planting out after the last expected frosts[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170].,
