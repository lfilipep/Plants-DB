America - Florida.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SabalEtonia.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SabalEtonia2.jpg",,"Sabal etonia is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; East Wall. By. South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"The fruit is a small dry berry with a thin sweet flesh[229]. The fruit is up to 13mm long and 15mm wide, with a seed up to 6.7mm long and 10mm wide[270]. Although we have seen no records of edibility for this species, the following uses are for the related S. palmetto. They quite probably also apply here[K]. Fruit - raw or cooked[2]. Sweet and pleasant[2]. A nourishing food, though it is said to be an acquired taste[2]. The fruit is up to 12mm long and 3mm wide[200]. Young leaves - raw or cooked. An excellent food[2]. Sap - sweet[2].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","The following reports are for S. palmetto. They quite probably also apply to this species[K]. An excellent fibre is obtained from the leaf stalks[171]. The best quality is from young leaf stalks still in the bud, whilst coarser material is obtained from older leaves or the bases of old leaf stalks surrounding the bud[171]. The fibres are up to 50cm long, they are harvested commercially and used to make brushes, especially where these have to remain stiff in hot water or caustics[171]. The roots contain tannin[171].",,"Succeeds in most fertile moist but well-drained soils in a sheltered sunny position[188, 200, 231]. Although it prefers a humid atmosphere, this species is tolerant of arid atmospheres so long as it has plenty of moisture available at the roots[231]. This palm tolerates short-lived freezes down to about -10°c and can be grown outdoors in the very mildest areas of the country[231]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. This species can also be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. Plants are very slow-growing when young and take a considerable time to establish[231].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse at not less than 24°c[188]. Stored seed is very slow to germinate. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing may shorten the germination time. Plants form a long tap-root some time before forming a shoot. Germination of fresh seed usually takes place in 3 - 4 months at 25°c[138]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
