0,Elaeagnus umbellata,Autumn Olive,Elaeagnaceae,3-9,E. umbellata has the potential of becoming one of the most troublesome adventive shrubs in the central and eastern United States.,Thickets and thin woods in the lowland and hills[58].,"E. Asia - China, Japan, Himalayas.",(4 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ElaeagnusUmbellata.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ElaeagnusUmbellata2.gif","Autumn olive is a nitrogen-fixing deciduous shrub or small tree growing up to 4.5m (14ft) at a medium growth rate. The flowers are fragrant, blooming in the spring, with a lovely warm spice smell. Autumn olive can grow in nutritionally poor soil and can tolerate drought and maritime exposure.","Elaeagnus umbellata is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4.5 m (14ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",E. crispa.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 46, 105]. Juicy and pleasantly acid, they are tasty raw and can also be made into jams, preserves etc[160, 183, 194]. The fruit must be fully ripe before it can be enjoyed raw, if even slightly under-ripe it will be quite astringent[K]. The fruit contains about 8.3% sugars, 4.5% protein, 1% ash[194]. The vitamin C content is about 12mg per 100g[194]. Mature bushes in the wild yield about 650g of fruit over 2 - 3 pickings[194]. The harvested fruit stores for about 15 days at room temperature[194]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200] and contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked[194]. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous[160].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cancer  Cardiac  Pectoral  Stimulant  Vitamin CThe flowers are astringent, cardiac and stimulant[240]. The seeds are used as a stimulant in the treatment of coughs[240]. The expressed oil from the seeds is used in the treatment of pulmonary affections[240]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].","Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it makes a good informal hedge, succeeding even in very exposed positions[75]. The plants make a reasonable wind-protecting screen, they are about as wide as they are tall. They make a good companion hedge, enriching the soil and fertilizing neighbouring plants[K]. The wood is a good fuel[146].","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropSucceeds in most soils that are well-drained[11, 200], though it dislikes shallow chalk soils[98]. It prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in very poor soils and in dry soils[11, 200]. Prefers a light sandy loam and a sunny position[11]. Established plants are very drought resistant[1]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -40°c[200]. This species is somewhat similar to E. multiflora, but it flowers a few weeks later[182]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. 'Cardinal' and 'Red Wing' are very good fruiting forms (developed for ornament and not for fruit quality)[182]. 'Jazbo' has been bred for its edible fruits which are said to be ripe when 'they drop into your hand'[214]. This makes them valuable in breeding programmes to develop easily harvested fruits[214]. Flowers are rich in nectar and very aromatic, they are much visited by bees. Polymorphic[11, 275]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. Plants can fruit in 6 years from seed[160]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[160, 200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November in a frame. Leave for 12 months. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
