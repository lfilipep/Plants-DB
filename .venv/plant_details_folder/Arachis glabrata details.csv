See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Arachis prostrata Benth.,,Flowers: ,,Possibly the flowers are edible. Green Deane at growables.org says the yellow blossoms are eaten raw and have a pea to bean-like flavor.,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.","Agroforestry Uses: The plant has potential for soil conservation and can be grown under some tree crops to provide nitrogen[310 ]. It is showing promise growing under coconuts in Indonesia[310 ]. The plant has been recommended as a green manure in Brazil[46 ]. Used in intensively grazed pastures, for hay and silage production, and agroforestry (e.g. under coconuts).  Also used for soil conservation (e.g. road verges) and as an ornamental.  May also have value in companion cropping systems, either with cool or warm season grains. A high quality forage plant.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Management: Fodder  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropPlants are productive from about latitudes 30N and 30c to near the equator. They have persisted in areas receiving rainfall as low as 750 mm per year but are probably best suited to areas receiving 1,000 - 2,000 mm[310 ]. Unlike many tropical legumes, it can compete successfully with sward-forming grasses[310 ]. It grows best when mean monthly temperatures are above about 20°c. Although tops are cut by frost, plants regrow vigorously with the onset of warmth and moisture[310 ]. During very dry conditions, top growth may die off, but rhizomes mostly survive, providing a nucleus for recovery[310 ]. Grows successfully on soils with textures ranging from sands to clays provided they are well-drained[310 ]. While apparently preferring acid soils, it has produced good yields on neutral to slightly alkaline soils[310 ]. It grows well on soils low in phosphorus[310 ] Grows well on infertile or fertile soils, but may suffer from excessive grass competition on the latter.  Appears to be less P-demanding than A. pintoi .This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. When planting in new areas, it is generally not necessary to inoculate the rhizomes[310 ]. Four cultivars have been released in Florida: 'Arb', 'Arblick', 'Florigraze' and 'Arbrook'. 'Arb' and 'Arblick' were selected initially, based on productivity and spreading ability respectively; 'Florigraze' was selected because it combined both characteristics, and 'Arbrook', the most recent release, because it is more drought-tolerant than 'Florigraze' but is of similar productivity[310 ]. One accession known as the Maiwa peanut (probably the Australian accession CPI 12121) has persisted well in Indonesia[310 ].","Despite often dense flowering, few seeds are set, except in some accessions prior to dense sward development[310 ]. Seedlings are usually quite large before they form rhizomes[310 ]. The plant is best propagated from rhizomes. While pieces of rhizome as short as 5 cm may strike, it is generally considered best to plant 30 cm square pieces of rhizome mat about 1.8 metres apart[310 ]. Alternatively, the rhizomes can be teased out, broadcast over the soil surface and disked in[310 ]. Rhizomes are planted at a depth of 3 cm in clay soils to 6.5 cm in coarse sands[310 ]. A clean seed-bed is preferable, to minimize competition for the developing plants[310 ]. Ideally, rhizomes should be produced in sandy soils for ease of digging[310 ]. Planting appears to be most successful when rhizomes are dormant[310 ]. With adequate temperature and moisture, shoots usually emerge 2 - 3 weeks after planting; dense swards develop as rhizomes form and extend the margins of the stand at up to 2 metres per year in the absence of competition, or 5 - 30 cm per year with grass competition[310 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
