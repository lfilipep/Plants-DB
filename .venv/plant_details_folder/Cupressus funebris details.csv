The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Chamaecyparis funebris. (Endl.)Franco.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AntiperiodicThe leaf is antiperiodic[218]. It is used in the treatment of bleeding piles, excessive menstrual flow etc[218]. A decoction of fruiting branches is used in the treatment of colds[218].",Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,"- hard, tough, white, durable, close grained. Used for general construction, agricultural implements etc[61, 109].",,"Thrives in a well-drained loamy or peaty soil[11]. Very tolerant of hot dry conditions[81]. Tolerates poor sandy soils[81] but is then more subject to insect damage in a succession of dry seasons[11]. Requires a sunny position[81]. Prefers a pH of 6 or lower[200]. Somewhat tender in Britain, at least in the north of the country[81], it also seems to be short-lived[185]. Plants do not succeed at Kew[11]. Cultivated as a timber crop in China[61]. Cones can remain closed on the tree for a number of years, opening after the heat of a forest fire to scatter their seeds which then germinate and grow rapidly in the ashes of the fire[200]. Plants are subject to injury by the wind[11, 81]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The crushed foliage has the scent of grass[185].","Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Three weeks cold stratification can improve germination rates[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c. The seedlings are very subject to damping off so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can store for several years[113]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, September in a frost-proof frame[1]. April/May is the best time to take cuttings[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
