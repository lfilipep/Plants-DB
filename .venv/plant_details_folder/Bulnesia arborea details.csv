It is drought tolerant and sometimes used as an ornamental plant. It is native to Colombia and Venezuela and known for its durable timber used in water turbines, mallet heads, pulley wheels, brush backs, and for railway crossties. Verawood can be grown through seeds, cuttings, or layering.","Bulnesia arborea is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 16 m (52ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Guaiacum arboreum (Jacq.) DC. Zygophyllum arboreum Jacq.,,,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Large flowering tree, Street tree, Specimen, Public open space, Bonsai subject, Xerophytic. The timber is exceptionally durable and so the tree is commonly harvested from the wild. It is also sometimes grown as an ornamental[307]. The heartwood is more or less striped and banded, varying in colour from light olive green to chocolate brown[ 316 ]. The surface of fresh wood often turns dark green upon exposure[ 316 ]. The sapwood is mostly thin and light yellow in colour[ 316 ]. The wood is fine textured, cross-grained, with an oily appearance and feel, mildly and pleasantly scented when warmed[ 316 ]. Owing to its high density and the resinous nature of the timber, the wood dries slowly and needs careful handling to avoid splitting, it is also prone to ring shake[ 316 ]. When seasoned, it is not easy to work either with machine or hand tools but does turn well in the lathe[ 316 ]. The heartwood is very durable under exposure and will last indefinitely in the ground[ 316 ]. There are reports that posts made from it have lasted for 300 years without rotting[ 307 ]. Because of its high density and self-lubrication, the wood has many uses similar to that of Lignum vitae (Guaiacum officinale), but is not considered as suitable for propeller-shaft bushings[ 316 ]. It is used as steps and collars for water turbines, mallet heads, pulley wheels, brush backs, locally for railway crossties[ 316 ].",,"Prefers a fertile, well-drained soil and a position in full sun[ 307 ].
