4,Known Hazards,"The leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them their sharp flavour. Perfectly all right in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since oxalic acid can bind up the body's supply of calcium leading to nutritional deficiency. The quantity of oxalic acid will be reduced if the leaves are cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Ground cover, Rock garden, Specimen. Easily grown in a sandy soil in a warm dry position in sun or light shade[1, 200]. Grows well in a dry shady corner[260]. Plants are not very cold-hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. Given a suitable position, it should succeed outdoors at least in the mildest parts of the country[K]. It should be possible to grow it even in the colder areas by digging up the bulbs in the autumn after the top growth has been cut down by frosts, storing them in a cool but frost-free place and replanting them in mid to late spring[K]. There are two main forms of this plant, ssp triangularis has smaller, green leaves and is, in our experience, slightly the hardier of the two. Ssp papilionacea has larger, dark purple leaves and is considered the more ornamental[K]. Special Features:Attractive foliage.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. The seed from one subspecies does not always come true - on at least one occasion we have hade the purple-leaved form grow from seed of the green leaved form that had definitely not been cross-pollinated[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.,
