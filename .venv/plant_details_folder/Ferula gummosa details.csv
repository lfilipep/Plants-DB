Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Carminative  Expectorant  StimulantThe whole plant, but especially the root, contains the gum resin 'galbanum'[4]. This is antispasmodic, carminative, expectorant and stimulant[4, 46, 64, 238]. It is used internally in the treatment of chronic bronchitis, asthma and other chest complaints[4, 238]. It is a digestive stimulant and antispasmodic, reducing flatulence, griping pains and colic[254]. Externally it is used as a plaster for inflammatory swellings, ulcers, boils, wounds and skin complaints[4, 238]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"The aromatic gum resin 'Galbanum' is obtained from wounds made in the stem[4]. It is collected by removing soil from around the top of the root and then cutting a slice off the root[64, 238] and can also be obtained from incisions made in the stem[238]. It is used medicinally and is also an ingredient of incense[1, 64, 171, 238]. It was an important ingredient of the incense used by the Israelites[268]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Requires a deep fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Another report says that it tolerates temperatures down to at least -15°c and should therefore succeed outdoors in most parts of the country[238]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance due to their long taproot[200]. They should be planted into their final positions as soon as possible. The flowers have an unpleasant smell[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as the seed is ripe in a greenhouse in autumn[1]. Otherwise sow in April in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Plant them out into their permanent positions whilst still small because the plants dislike root disturbance[1]. Give the plants a protective mulch for at least their first winter outdoors. Division in autumn. This may be inadvisable due to the plants dislike of root disturbance.
