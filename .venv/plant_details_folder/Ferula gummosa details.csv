It is used medicinally and is also an ingredient of incense[1, 64, 171, 238]. It was an important ingredient of the incense used by the Israelites[268].",,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Requires a deep fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Another report says that it tolerates temperatures down to at least -15°c and should therefore succeed outdoors in most parts of the country[238]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance due to their long taproot[200]. They should be planted into their final positions as soon as possible. The flowers have an unpleasant smell[245].",Seed - best sown as soon as the seed is ripe in a greenhouse in autumn[1]. Otherwise sow in April in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Plant them out into their permanent positions whilst still small because the plants dislike root disturbance[1]. Give the plants a protective mulch for at least their first winter outdoors. Division in autumn. This may be inadvisable due to the plants dislike of root disturbance.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
