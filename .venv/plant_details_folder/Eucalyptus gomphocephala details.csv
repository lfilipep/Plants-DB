0,Eucalyptus gomphocephala,Tuart. Tuart Gum,Myrtaceae,9-11,None Known,It grows naturally on the coastal plains of Western Australia. Coastal plains from Jurien Bay north of Perth to Ludlow in the south; on coastal sands that are not highly calcareous but may have limestone at depth.,Native to the southwest of Western Australia,(0 of 5),(4 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Tender,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Eucalyptus_gomphocephala1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Eucalyptus_gomphocephala2.JPEG","One of the six forest giants of the south Western Australia including: Corymbia calophylla (Marri), Eucalyptus diversicolor (Karri), Eucaltptus jacksonii (Red Tingle), Eucalyptus marinata (Jarrah),Eucalyptus patens (Yarri). A durable hardwood for scantlings, structural timber, the construction of railway carriages, boat building, and furniture manufacture.  Due to over-logging the Tuart is a protected tree with conditions placed on felling. A good carbon farming plant as an industrial biomass crop.","Eucalyptus gomphocephala is an evergreen Tree growing to 40 m (131ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Eucalyptus gomphocephala var. rhodoxylon Blakely & H.Steedman,,,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"A durable hardwood for scantlings, structural timber, the construction of railway carriages, and boat building. Also furniture making. The green wood has a density of 1,250 kilograms per cubic metre (78 lb/cu ft) and an air-dried density of 1,030 kilograms per cubic metre (64 lb/cu ft). Flowers good for honey. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Other Systems: SRC.","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Other Systems: SRCClimate: Mediterranean, subtropical to tropical, tropical highlands. Humidity: humid. Prefers sandy well drained soils, often over limestone, in sunny positions. Moderately tolerant of saline soil and salt-laden winds. Drought and frost tolerant. Individual trees may live over four hundred years. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: standard, coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seeds are first planted in a nursery, then transplanted after 6-10 weeks. For rapid growth the area must be free of weeds.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
