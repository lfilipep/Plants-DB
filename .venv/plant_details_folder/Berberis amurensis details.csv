See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",B. vulgaris amurensis.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,Fruit - cooked. Used in preserves[177].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antirheumatic  Cancer  DysenteryThe root is antirheumatic[218]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].","Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",Plants are very amenable to trimming and can be grown as an almost impenetrable formal or informal hedge[200].,,"Prefers a warm moist loamy soil and light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. This species is closely allied to B. vulgaris, it hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[1]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely and will resprout well from the base[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78].
