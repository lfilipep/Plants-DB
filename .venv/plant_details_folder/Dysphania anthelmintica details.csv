4,Known Hazards,"The essential oil in the seed and flowering plant is highly toxic. In excess it can cause dizziness, vomiting, convulsions and even death[ 222 , 238 ]. The plant can also cause dermatitis or other allergic reactions[ 222 ]. The leaves and seeds of all members of this genus are more or less edible. However, many of the species in this genus contain saponins, though usually in quantities too small to do any harm. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[ K ]. The plants also contain some oxalic acid, which in large quantities can lock up some of the nutrients in the food. However, even considering this, they are very nutritious vegetables in reasonable quantities. Cooking the plant will reduce its content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[ 238 ].",
5,Habitats,"Mainly found on dry wasteland and cultivated ground[ 204 , 268 ]. Sand dunes, pinelands, meadows, roadsides, and other waste areas; at elevations up to 1,100 metres in southern N. America[ 270 ].",

13,Summary,"An erect, multi-branched, annual to short-lived perennial plant growing around 1 metre tall. The plant is a popular and very effective vermifuge, as well as having many other medicinalproperties. Prior to the introduction of synthetic compounds the plant was widely cultivated for the control of hookworms and roundworms and it is still often grown for medicinal and culinary use, especially in its native Mexico.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Dysphania anthelmintica is a ANNUAL/PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"TeaLeaves - cooked[ 2 ]. The tender leaves are sometimes used as a potherb[ 183 ]. Used as a condiment in soups etc[ 46 , 61 , 105 ], it is said to reduce flatulence if eaten with beans[ 183 ]. The leaves have a rank taste due to the presence of resinous dots and sticky hairs[ 85 ]. The raw leaves should only be eaten in small quantities, see the notes above on toxicity. Seed - cooked[ 105 , 161 ]. The seed is small and fiddly, it should be soaked in water overnight and thoroughly rinsed before it is used in order to remove any saponins. An infusion of the leaves is a tea substitute[ 183 ].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiasthmatic  Antidiarrhoeal  Carminative  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Foot care  Parasiticide  Skin  Stings  Stomachic  VermifugeWormseed is a Central American herb that has been used for centuries to expel parasitic worms from the body[ 254 ]. The seed, or the essential oil obtained from the seed and flowering stem is used for this, though all parts of the plant are used medicinally. The plant, especially the essential oil, is toxic in larger doses and so should be used with care and preferably under the direction of a skilled practitioner[ 21 , 238 ]. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women[ 238 ]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Until fairly recently, this was one of the most commonly used vermifuges, though it has now been largely replaced by synthetic drugs[ 222 ]. The seed, or the essential oil, was used[ 213 ]. It is very effective against most parasites, including the amoeba that causes dysentery, but is less effective against tapeworm[ 213 , 238 ]. Fasting should not precede its use and there have occasionally been cases of poisoning caused by this treatment[ 213 ]. The essential oil is used externally to treat athlete's foot and insect bites[ 238 , 240 ]. This is at its highest concentration in the flowering stems before seed is set, these contain around 0.7% essential oil of which almost 50% is the active vermifuge ascaridol[ 240 ]. The essential oil is of similar quality from plants cultivated in warm climates and those in cool climates[ 240 ]. The whole plant is analgesic, antiasthmatic, carminative, febrifuge, stomachic and vermifuge[ 1 , 4 , 21 , 57 , 145 , 147 , 171 ]. An infusion can be used as a digestive remedy, being taken to settle a wide range of problems such colic, diarrhoea and stomach pains; it is also used to treat conditions such as coughs, fevers and internal haemorrhages[ 254 , 348 ]. The leaves are added in small quantities as a flavouring for various cooked bean dishes because their carminative activity can reduce flatulence[ 222 ]. Externally, it has been used as a wash for haemorrhoids, as a poultice to detoxify snake bites and other poisons and is thought to have wound-healing properties[ 254 ]. The macerated leaves and flowers are mixed with a pinch of salt, and used as a poultice for treating persistent sores[ 348 ]. The essential oil is high in ascaridol, a nematicidal terpene peroxide which is active against ascaris, worms and ankylostomes[ 348 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,Other Uses: The plant is used as a fumigant against mosquitoes and is also added to fertilizers to inhibit insect larvae[ 238 ]. Gold/green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[ 168 ].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 22°c, but can tolerate 4 - 31°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of -1°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 800 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 300 - 4,200mm[ 418 ]. An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils but disliking shade[ 1 , 200 ]. It prefers a moderately fertile soil[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7.5, tolerating 5 - 8.7[ 418 ]. The bruised leaves emit an unpleasant foetid odour[ 245 ]. Flowering Time: Blooms all year",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - whilst it can be sown in situ in mid to late spring, we have had better results by sowing the seed in a cold frame in early spring. Put a few seeds in each pot and thin to the best plant if necessary. Germination rates are usually very good and the seedlings should appear within a few days of sowing the seed. Plant out in late spring, after the last expected frosts.",
