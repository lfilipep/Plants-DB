14,Physical Characteristics,"Cotinus coggygria is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves[2, 179]. They are possibly edible[105, 177]. Some caution is advised. A volatile oil in the leaves contains pinene and camphene[179]. One report suggests that the essential oil contained in the flowers and leaves has a mango-like odour[158]. We have tried these leaves and really would not recommend them to anyone[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cholagogue  Febrifuge  OphthalmicThe yellow wood is used as a cholagogue, febrifuge and for eye ailments[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the leaves and flowers[105]. It has a mango-like smell[158]. Is it edible[K]? A yellow to orange dye is obtained from the root and stem[1, 4, 11, 14, 57]. It is somewhat fugitive though[4]. The leaves and bark are a good source of tannins[46, 61, 158].  - ornamental. Used for cabinet making, picture frames[158]. The twigs are used in basketry[158]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Dye: Botanical dyes replacing synthetic dyes (known as heavy polluters).,Industrial Crop: Tannin: Occur generally in the roots, wood, bark, leaves, and fruit of many plants. Used in tanning leather, dyeing fabric, making ink, and medical applications.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Wild Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Dye  Industrial Crop: Tannin  Management: Coppice  Wild CropLandscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Pollard, Screen, Standard, Specimen. Tolerates most soils[202]. Prefers a well-drained dry or moist soil in a sunny position[108, 200], doing better in a soil that is not very rich[11, 49]. Prefers a fertile but not over-rich soil[188]. Tolerates light shade[188]. Established plants are drought tolerant. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184], though die-back often occurs at the tips of shoots during the winter[202]. Plants are slow to establish but are then quite fast growing when young though they slow down with age[202]. Hybridizes with C. obovatus[182]. A number of cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value[182, 200]. The purple-leafed cultivars are susceptible to mildew[202]. Plants flower on wood that is at least 3 years old[202]. Any pruning is best done in the spring[202]. Branches sometimes wilt, especially after hard pruning, and these should be removed[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 113, 200]. It should germinate in the spring. Slightly immature or 'green' seed, harvested when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant, gives the best results[113]. Warm stratify stored seed for 2 - 3 months at 15°c, then cold stratify for 2 - 3 months[164]. Germination can be very slow, often taking 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed has a long viability and should store for several years[113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Trench layering in spring[200]."
