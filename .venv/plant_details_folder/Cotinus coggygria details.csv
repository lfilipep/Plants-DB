It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Rhus coggygria.

A volatile oil in the leaves contains pinene and camphene[179]. One report suggests that the essential oil contained in the flowers and leaves has a mango-like odour[158]. We have tried these leaves and really would not recommend them to anyone[K].","Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Tolerates most soils[202]. Prefers a well-drained dry or moist soil in a sunny position[108, 200], doing better in a soil that is not very rich[11, 49]. Prefers a fertile but not over-rich soil[188]. Tolerates light shade[188]. Established plants are drought tolerant. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184], though die-back often occurs at the tips of shoots during the winter[202]. Plants are slow to establish but are then quite fast growing when young though they slow down with age[202]. Hybridizes with C. obovatus[182]. A number of cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value[182, 200]. The purple-leafed cultivars are susceptible to mildew[202]. Plants flower on wood that is at least 3 years old[202]. Any pruning is best done in the spring[202]. Branches sometimes wilt, especially after hard pruning, and these should be removed[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 113, 200]. It should germinate in the spring. Slightly immature or 'green' seed, harvested when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant, gives the best results[113]. Warm stratify stored seed for 2 - 3 months at 15°c, then cold stratify for 2 - 3 months[164]. Germination can be very slow, often taking 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed has a long viability and should store for several years[113].

Trench layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
