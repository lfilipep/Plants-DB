21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  DeobstruentThe gum (an oleo resin according to one report) that is obtained from the base of the stems is antispasmodic and deobstruent[4]. It is nowadays considered to be a medium of feeble powers though it was at one time widely used in the treatment of menstrual disorders, asthma, chronic visceral afflictions etc[4]."
22,Other Uses,"Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any good garden soil[1]. It can tolerate very considerable neglect, some plants we were growing were left to fend for themselves in very dense weed growth and survived well for 8 years before being moved to another site[K]. We are not sure how hardy this plant is, but the foliage has withstood short periods of temperatures down to -6°c with us[K]. A warm climate is necessary in order to produce good quality gum[4]. Plants seem to be very tolerant of root disturbance, specimens that had been growing for 4 years in one site grew away very well when transplanted as they came into growth in late autumn[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ. If seed is in short supply then it is best to sow it in a pot in the greenhouse in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer.
