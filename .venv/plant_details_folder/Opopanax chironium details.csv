It can tolerate very considerable neglect, some plants we were growing were left to fend for themselves in very dense weed growth and survived well for 8 years before being moved to another site[K]. We are not sure how hardy this plant is, but the foliage has withstood short periods of temperatures down to -6°c with us[K]. A warm climate is necessary in order to produce good quality gum[4]. Plants seem to be very tolerant of root disturbance, specimens that had been growing for 4 years in one site grew away very well when transplanted as they came into growth in late autumn[K].",Seed - sow spring in situ. If seed is in short supply then it is best to sow it in a pot in the greenhouse in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
