Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a well-drained soil in full sun[200]. A deep-rooted plant, it prefers a sandy loam with added leaf mould[1]. This species is well-suited to informal and naturalistic plantings, especially as part of a collection of native species[200]. Plants are monocarpic, living for a number of years without flowering and then dying after flowering[200]. The stems, leaves and flowers are dotted with glands, making the plant look blistered[200]. There is some doubt in my mind as to the correct name for this species. The information was collected under the name Petalostemum purpureum, which is given in [200] as a synonym for this species. However, there is also a Dalea purpureum and I wonder if the entry in [200] is correct[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water and sow in early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
