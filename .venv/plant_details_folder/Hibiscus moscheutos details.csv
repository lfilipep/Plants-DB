The flowers are about 15cm in diameter[233], though in some cultivars they are up to 25cm in diameter[260]. They have a mild flavour and somewhat mucilaginous texture with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste[K]. The leaves are rather bland and are also mucilaginous, but have a slight hairiness to them which detracts a little from the pleasure of eating them[K]."

Another report says that it needs to be grown in a warm garden in the warmer areas of Britain[233]. Plants of the cultivar 'Southern Belle' have been seen growing outdoors at Kew Gardens, they are situated on a south-east facing wall of the Temperate House and have been there for at least 3 years as of 2000[K]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200].  Special Features:North American native, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies."
