Requires a moist neutral to acid soil[200]. Succeeds in acid clay soils[187]. Dormant plants are hardy to at least -25°c, but the new growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts[187]. Plants only produce their fruit in warm seasons in Britain[200]. They have shortly-creeping underground stems and form dense patches[187].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the spring[200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring in a cold frame[164]. It sometimes germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c, but may take a year. The seed should be completely separated from the fruit and should only just be covered by soil[164, 200]. If the seed has been sown thinly enough, then it is possible to leave the seedlings in the pot for their first growing season, dividing them after they become dormant. Make sure to give them liquid feeds at intervals through the spring and summer. Otherwise prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in late spring or early summer at the beginning of their second or third years growth. Division in spring as new growth is just commencing[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
