18,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Antitussive  Diuretic  Dysentery  ExpectorantThe bark is analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive, diuretic and expectorant[176, 238]. It controls bacterial infections and coughs[238]. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery, cataracts, cough and asthma[176]. The bark contains aesculin, this has anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant and analgesic actions[176]. The bark also contains fraxetin. This has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system, is a stronger and safer anodyne than aspirin and has some antibacterial activity[176]."
20,Other Uses,"Wax: Used for making candles etc.,Weather protection: Plants that can be used to give the body protection from severe weather."
21,Other Uses Description,"A commercial insect wax is produced on the branches[178]. We are not sure how the wax is produced, one report says that it is as a result of eggs being laid by insects. Another report says that the wax is produced by the plant due to the stimulation of the feeding insects. Yet another report says that the wax is produced from secretions of the insects[178]. The wax is used for making candles and as a polish for earthenware pots, book edges etc[178]. The plant (extract?) is said to be used as a barrier to protect the skin from ultra-violet light[176]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[200]. Plants succeed when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. They tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. This species might be dioecious, in which case male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds."
