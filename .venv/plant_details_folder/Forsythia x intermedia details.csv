22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in a well drained ordinary garden soil but prefers a rich soil[1]. Succeeds in limy soils[11]. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in semi shade[200]. Plants are tolerant of deep shade[219]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are several named varieties. Any pruning out of weak shoots, plus any trimming of hedges, is best done after the plant has flowered[188]. Birds may destroy the flower buds in cold areas[200]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Blooms are very showy. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 2 months[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This is a hybrid species and seed will not come true to type. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 15cm taken at a node, July/August in a frame. Plant out in autumn or spring. A very high percentage, they root within 3 weeks[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in a sheltered outdoor bed. Good percentage[78]."
