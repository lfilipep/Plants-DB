24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist, lowland tropics, found at elevations from sea level to around 1,300 metres[299 ]. It is found in areas where the average annual rainfall is about 1,500mm, often with a distinct dry season[299 ]. It strongly responds to water stress by developing shrivelled stems and yellowing of the leaves, and cannot survive under dry conditions[299 ]. Grows best in a well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter[300 ]. Prefers a position in light shade[300 ]. Crops are produced about 70 days after planting and continue for 1 year or more[300 ]. Plants can be harvested all year round if the flowering stems are removed[299 ]. Yields of 15 kilos per plant per annum are obtained[300 ]. The stems are very tender and break easily, even when handled with care[299 ]. Flowering shoots are removed in order to maximise leaf production[300 ]. There are several cultivars of superior quality[332 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - viability tends to be very poor, generally less than 2%. It should be sown in pervious humid soil under light shade. Germination takes several days[299 ]. Spontaneous seedlings are sometimes collected for transplanting[299 ]. Semi-ripe cuttings 10 - 15cm long with 4 - 6 nodes are used. It is recommended to remove the leaves and tops before planting[299 ]. Cuttings are planted straight into their permanent positions in moist well-drained soil rich in organic matter and always under a tree or shrub for shade and support[299 ]. Cuttings of mature shoots up to 25cm long[300 ]."
