Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 21 - 28c, but can tolerate 10 - 35c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,600 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,200 - 2,400mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Prefers well-drained, light loams of good depth and fertile sandy soils[63 , 418 ]. Dislikes poor soils[63 ]. Plants are very susceptible to drought[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 6.5, tolerating 5.5 - 7[418 ]. Fruits take about 4 months to ripen from flowering[63 ]. Plants can take up to 20 years to produce their first crop from seed, though this can be greatly reduced by applying shade and wind protection when the plants are young[200 ].",
