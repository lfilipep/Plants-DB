18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked. Highly prized in China, both for their earliness and their delicate flavour[195], they taste somewhat like hominy corn[183]. Neither acrid nor bitter, even in the raw state. The shoots, which are about 4cm in diameter[266] are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant has been suggested as being useful for soil and water stabilization on hills and levees[195]. The canes are strong and useful in their whole state, but do not split well[195]. They can be used for plant supports etc."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position. Dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts. New growth begins in early spring. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring."
