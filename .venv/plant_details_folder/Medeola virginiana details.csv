25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers light shade and plenty of leaf mould in a slightly acid soil[200]. Prefers a rich sandy soil[1]. The rootstock has a pleasant refreshing smell of cucumber[245]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame in a well-drained soil-less medium[200]. Fully remove the fleshy seed covering because this contains germination inhibitors. The seed should germinate in the spring[K]. Spring sown seed can be slow to germinate and may take 12 months or more[K]. The seed should be sown thinly so that the seedlings can be grown on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. If necessary apply a liquid feed at intervals through the growing season to ensure that the plants grow on well. Prick the roots out into individual pots in the autumn and grow them on in a shady part of the greenhouse for at least the next growing season, planting them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant. Division in spring as the plant comes into growth[1]."
