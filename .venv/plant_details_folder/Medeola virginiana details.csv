Fully remove the fleshy seed covering because this contains germination inhibitors. The seed should germinate in the spring[K]. Spring sown seed can be slow to germinate and may take 12 months or more[K]. The seed should be sown thinly so that the seedlings can be grown on undisturbed in the pot for their first year. If necessary apply a liquid feed at intervals through the growing season to ensure that the plants grow on well. Prick the roots out into individual pots in the autumn and grow them on in a shady part of the greenhouse for at least the next growing season, planting them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant.
