18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Not very appetizing raw, the flavour is improved by cooking[183]. We found the fruit to be much nicer than the rather similar S. nigrum guineense. Although smaller, it has a sweeter flavour[K]. Still not one of the most appetizing fruits to eat, though[K]. The fruit is about 1cm in diameter and is produced in small bunches[200, K].",
