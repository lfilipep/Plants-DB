23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very sunny position[11] and a calcareous soil[200]. This species is also likely to require a very well-drained light or medium soil[K]. The cliffrose is not very hardy in Britain, it is unlikely to succeed outdoors in any but the mildest areas of the country and will probably require the protection of a sunny wall even there[11, 200, K]. The flowers are resinous and strongly fragrant[229]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species, but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
