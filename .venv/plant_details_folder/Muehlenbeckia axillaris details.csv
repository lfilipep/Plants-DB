A climbing plant that supports itself by twining around other plants etc[219]. Plants can become invasive, spreading by means of underground shoots[208]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in autumn and overwinter in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Plant out in late spring. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 5 - 10cm with a heel, October/November in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Division in spring[200]."
