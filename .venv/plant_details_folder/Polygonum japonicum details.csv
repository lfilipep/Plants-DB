1,Common Name,"Japanese Knotweed, Mexican Bamboo, Japanese Knotweed",
2,Family,Polygonaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,4-10,
4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been made for this species, there have been reports that some members of this genus can cause photosensitivity in susceptible people. Many species also contain oxalic acid (the distinctive lemony flavour of sorrel) - whilst not toxic this substance can bind up other minerals making them unavailable to the body and leading to mineral deficiency. Having said that, a number of common foods such as sorrel and rhubarb contain oxalic acid and the leaves of most members of this genus are nutritious and beneficial to eat in moderate quantities. Cooking the leaves will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",

13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Pink. Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer. Form: Upright or erect.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Polygonum japonicum is a PERENNIAL growing to 3 m (9ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to October, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots in spring - cooked. They can be used as an asparagus substitute[55, 62, 116, 1599, 179, 183]. They have an acid flavour and can also be used as a rhubarb substitute in pies, fruit soups, jams etc[183]. Older stems and shoot tips - cooked[62, 159]. They taste like a mild version of rhubarb[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It is rather small and fiddly to utilize. The seed can also be ground into a powder and used as a flavouring and thickener in soups etc, or can be mixed with cereals when making bread, cakes etc. The root is sometimes eaten[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.,Women's complaints: A very vague title, it deals with a miscellany of problems peculiar to the female sex.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiphlogistic  Antitumor  Depurative  Diuretic  Emollient  Febrifuge  Stomachic  Vulnerary  Women's complaintsThe root is antiphlogistic, bechic, depurative, diuretic, emmenagogue, emollient, febrifuge, stomachic and vulnerary[46, 61, 147, 178, 218]. It is also used in the treatment of women's complaints[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of burn injuries, boils and abscesses, poisonous snakebites, acute hepatitis, appendicitis, traumatic injuries and menstrual irregularities[147]. The leaves can be crushed and applied externally as a poultice to abscesses, cuts etc, whilst the dried roots can be ground into a powder and applied externally[147]. Extracts of the plant have shown antitumour activity[218].",
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow dye is obtained from the root[46, 61]. The plant is potentially a good source of biomass. Plants can be grown to form a ground cover that will exclude all other growth[208]. It is best to use the sub-species compactum since this is less invasive[208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Specimen, Woodland garden. A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in ordinary garden soil in sun or shade[1, 111], though it prefers a moist soil in partial shade[187]. Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive plant capable of sending up new shoots at a considerable distance from the main clump and also of growing up through tarmac[200]. The sub-species cuspidatum is the form that is most likely to cause problems. It is considered to be a pest in many areas, where it is forming large clumps in the wild and out-competing native species. If grown in the garden it should be planted within a strong barrier to contain its roots. The sub-species compacta is only about 70cm tall and is far less invasive, but should still not be grown in small gardens[200]. A report on the Natural History Programme stated that Japanese knotweed is actually becoming a very valuable habitat for spiders, frogs, grass snakes and many other creatures. Its hollow stems allow a wide variety of insects and other small creatures to overwinter and find hiding places, thus a greater abundance of food is provided for insectivores such as frogs, who are themselves eaten by grass snakes. In areas of north Wales where Japanese knotweed has run rife, it is now the primary habitat for grass snakes[215]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Often cultivated as a dye and a medicinal plant[46, 61]. Very closely related to P. conspicuum[58]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[58]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Invasive, Wetlands plant.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually free and easy. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have reached sufficient size. If not, overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out the following spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
