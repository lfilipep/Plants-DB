Too small to be exploited commercially, this high quality wood is often used locally for flooring, cogs, tool handles, golf clubs etc[46, 61, 82, 171, 226, 227, 229, 235].

Thrives in any good loam, including chalk, it does not demand much light[1, 11]. Prefers a deep open loam[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A slow-growing and short-lived tree in the wild[229], it is slower growing than C. betulinus in cultivation[11]. Seed production is cyclic, a year of heavy yields being followed by 2 - 4 years of low yields[229]. Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown in an outdoors seedbed as soon as it is ripe[78]. Germination is usually good, though it may take 18 months[80]. If collected whilst still 'green' (after the seed is ripe but before it has dried fully on the plant) and sown immediately it should germinate in the following spring[80]. Grow the plants on for two years in the seedbed and then plant them out into their permanent positions in the winter. The average seed viability is around 65%[98]. Pre-treat stored seed with 4 weeks warm and 12 weeks cold stratification and sow in a cold frame[98]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 15cm tall before planting them into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
