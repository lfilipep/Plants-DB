Although this is a plant of swamps and other wet soils in the wild, once established it can succeed in Britain when growing in an ordinary good loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. It prefers a neutral to alkaline soil according to one report[200], whilst another says that it requires a lime-free soil[98]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and growing in maritime regions[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it has a moderate rate of growth and moderate longevity[229]. Resents root disturbance, it is difficult to transplant except when young[11]. The tree does not come into leaf until late May. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed can be sown in late winter in a cold frame[78] but would probably benefit from an earlier sowing if the seed can be obtained any sooner. Three months stratification at 5°c improves germination[200]. Germination rates are variable[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Layering.",
