13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Actinidia arguta is a deciduous Climber growing to 15 m (49ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from May to November, in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"it - raw, cooked or dried for later use[1, 3, 61, 105]. Sweeter than A. deliciosa, the kiwi fruit[183], the skin is smooth and can be eaten with the fruit[K]. The fruit contains up to 5 times the vitamin C content of blackcurrants[74]. Highly esteemed according to one report[151] whilst another says that they are insipid[11]. The fruits are greenish-yellow or purple-red when mature and are about 2 to 3cm long[198, 266]. They contain a number of small seeds, but these are easily eaten with the fruit[K]. The plant is rich in sap and this can be tapped and drunk in the spring[105, 177, 183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sound loamy neutral soil[1, 200]. Tolerates acid and moderately alkaline soils[202]. Succeeds in semi-shade but full sun is best for fruit production[200]. Prefers a sheltered position[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to -30°c or more, but the young spring growth is susceptible to frost damage[160]. Some cultivars are said to tolerate temperatures down to about -50°c when fully dormant[160]. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruit and it is increasingly being seen as having potential in Britain. There are some named varieties[183]. Plants are usually dioecious but the cultivar 'Issai' is self-fertile[200]. A polymorphic species[74]. Fruits are formed on second year wood and also on fruit spurs on older wood[126], any pruning is best carried out in the winter[219]. Plants only flower when grown in warm climates[202]. This species flowers well in gardens in the south and west of Britain[219], the small flowers being sweetly scented[245]. This is a climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around branches etc[200]. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Woody. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. The root pattern is a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[133]. It is probably best if the seed is given 3 months stratification[113], either sow it in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in November or as soon as it is received. Fresh seed germinates in 2 - 3 months at 10°c, stored seed can take longer[133]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. When the plants are 30cm or more tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[K]. Most seedlings are male[126]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so they must be kept well ventilated[113]. Cuttings of softwood as soon as ready in spring in a frame[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of ripe wood, October/November in a frame.",
