26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[1, 133]. The seed is best sown when it is ripe in the autumn. It usually germinates in 4 - 8 weeks at 15°c[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division is very easy at almost any time of the year, the divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions if required.",
