0,Salicornia bigelovii,"Dwarf Glasswort, Dwarf saltwort",Chenopodiaceae,Coming soon,"The seed contains saponins[252]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching the seed or flour in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Salt marshes by the coast[43, 235, 270], often colonising new areas of mud flats through its prolific seed production[252].",Eastern N.

It is in flower from August to September, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.","Salicornia mucronata Bigelow, non Lag.",Cultivated Beds;,Leaves: ,"Oil: Oil,Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Oil: ","g leaves and stems - cooked or pickled[105, 172, 177]. The raw seed is inedible due to the presence of saponins, though these remain in the seed-meal when the oil is extracted[252]. The seed contains about 30% of an edible oil and 35% protein[252]. The oil is highly polyunsaturated and similar to safflower oil (Carthamnus tinctorius) in fatty-acid composition[252]. It has a pleasant nut-like flavour and a texture similar to olive oil[252].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The plants native habitat will give some idea of its cultivation needs. Recent research has shown this plant to have excellent potential as a commercial crop in arid and desert regions near the sea. It needs irrigation, which can sustainably be provided by using sea water.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in situ as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise sow in spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
