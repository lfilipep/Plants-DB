See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Moth.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant is not wind tolerant.",Dracaena lennei Baker Dracaena yuccoides Baker Sarcoyucca elephantipes (Regel ex Trel.) Linding.

They have a slightly bitter but quite agreeable flavour, and constitute a palatable vegetable[331 ]. Usually they are dipped in egg and fried, or mixed with meat stews, and sometimes they are eaten raw in combination with other raw salad vegetables[301 , 331 ]. The flowers are rich in vitamin C[418 ]. The tender leaf bases can be eaten[418 ].",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Vitamin CNone known,,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is an ornamental one and, partly for that reason, is often planted about houses, especially for tall hedges[331 ]. In some regions, it is planted thickly on steep high roadside banks to prevent erosion[331 ]. It is also used to stabilize terracing in coffee plantations[418 ]. Other Uses A fibre obtained from the leaves is used to make twine, cloth and baskets[418 ]. Young plants are occasionally used as houseplants. However the species grows best in a hot semi-arid climate, so plants are subject to root rot if overwatered.","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the drier tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,700 metres, it can be grown in much wetter areas if the soil is very well-drained[418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 32°c, but can tolerate 6 - 38°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,600mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position that is sheltered from cold, drying winds[200 ]. Prefers a well-drained, rich, loamy soil, but is tolerant of poor sandy soils[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 7.3[418 ]. The plant can be harvested for its flower buds 2 - 3 years after planting out cuttings[418 ]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233 ]. The flowers of most members of this genus can only be pollinated by a certain species of moth. This moth does not live outside of the plants native range and, if fruit and seed is required, hand pollination is necessary. This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. The flowers open at night[229 ] and are powerfully fragrant at this time[245 ].",Seed - pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. Sow in containers in a lightly shaded position. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on until large enough to plant out. Root cuttings. Lift the plant and remove small buds from the base of the stem and rhizomes. Dip in dry wood ashes to stop any bleeding and plant in a sandy soil in pots until established[78 ].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
