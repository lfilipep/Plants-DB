The whole plant is used as an astringent, hypoglycaemic, mild narcotic and mild sedative[4, 102, 222, 238]. It also slows and strengthens heart contractions[238]. The plant has been shown to be of value in the treatment of hyperthyroidism[222, 238], it is also used in the treatment of coughs, bleeding from the lungs and consumption, excessive menstruation etc[4, 238]. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women or patients with hypothyroidism[238]. The plant is harvested as flowering begins and can be use fresh or dried, in an infusion or as a tincture[4, 238]. The root has been chewed, a portion swallowed and the rest applied externally in the treatment of snakebites[257]. Current uses are predominantly for increased activity of the thyroid gland and for premenstrual syndrome symptoms such as breast pain [301]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Lycopus for nervousness and premenstrual syndrome (see [302] for critics of commission E)."

Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring or autumn[238].

Plant them out in the spring."
