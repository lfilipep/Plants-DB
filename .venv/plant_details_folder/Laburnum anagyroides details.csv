13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Laburnum anagyroides is a deciduous Tree growing to 6 m (19ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PectoralThe seed contains the poisonous alkaloid 'cystisine'. This has been used in the treatment of whooping cough and asthma[4].
22,Other Uses,"Insecticide: Kills insects.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"This plant is often used as a rootstock for other members of the pea and bean family[11]. The seeds contain the poisonous alkaloid 'cytisine'. This has insecticidal properties similar to nicotine (Nicotiana spp.) but cannot be recommended for used since it needs to be used in such a concentration that it can then be absorbed over a wide area of the body with possibly fatal results[4].  - coarse grained, durable, dark coloured and very hard, it can be used as an ebony substitute[4, 11, 46]. It is much in demand among turners, and is used in making instruments and furniture especially where strength and smoothness are important[4, 11, 46, 61]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very tolerant and easily grown plant, it succeeds in almost any soil or situation[1] so long as it is not water-logged[11]. It grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in cold exposed situations and tolerates industrial pollution[200]. Plants can be successfully transplanted even when quite large[200]. The flowers are delicately scented[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse or cold frame[200]. Germination is usually very quick and good[78]. Prick out indoor-sown seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Another option is to pre-soak the stored seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in an outdoor seed bed in early spring. These plants an be allowed to grow on in the seedbed for two years before planting them out in the winter. Cuttings of mature wood in late winter planted in the open ground[200].
