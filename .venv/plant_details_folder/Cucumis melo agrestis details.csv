18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[1, 2, 46, 105]. A bitter flavour[183]. The ripe fruit can be eaten raw, whilst the immature fruits are cooked as a vegetable[272]. Seed - raw[57, 86, 105]. Rich in oil with a nutty flavour but very fiddly to use because the seed is small and covered with a fibrous coat[K]. The seed contains between 12.5 - 39.1% oil[218]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[105, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The fruits can be used as a cooling light cleanser or moisturiser for the skin[201]. They are also used as a first aid treatment for burns and abrasions[201]. The flowers are expectorant and emetic[218]. The fruit is stomachic[218]. The seed is antitussive, digestive, febrifuge and vermifuge[218]. When used as a vermifuge, the whole seed complete with the seed coat is ground into a fine flour, then made into an emulsion with water and eaten. It is then necessary to take a purge in order to expel the tapeworms or other parasites from the body[7]. The root is diuretic and emetic[218]. A paste of the plant is applied as a poultice around the naval when there is difficulty in urinating[272]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich, well-drained moisture retentive soil and a warm, very sunny position[200]. A frost-tender annual plant, this form of the melon is closest to the wild species. The fruit has a bitter flavour but the plant is of potential value in breeding programmes. Grows well with corn and sunflowers but dislikes potatoes[20, 201]. The weeds fat hen and sow thistle improve the growth and cropping of melons[201]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse in a rich soil. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Sow 2 or 3 seeds per pot and thin out to the best plant. Grow them on fast and plant out after the last expected frosts, giving them cloche or frame protection for at least their first few weeks if you are trying them outdoors."
