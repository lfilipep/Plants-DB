Nakai,"Edgeworthia papyrifera is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 2 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from February to April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Edgeworthia papyrifera Siebold & Zucc. is a synonym of Edgeworthia tomentosa (Thunb.)

See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.","A high-class paper is made from the bark[1, 11, 58, 61, 200]. The bark fibres are used[61]. The stems are harvested in spring or early summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The outer bark is removed from the inner by peeling or scraping. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with soda ash and then beaten with mallets or put through a blender. The paper is off white in colour[189]. The stems are extremely supple and can be tied in knots[11, 182]. It is used to make edible rice paper. Carbon Farming Solutions -  Industrial Crop: fiber (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1].","Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.","Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: CoppiceClimate: warm temperate to subtropical. Humidity: humid. Succeeds in any soil in sun or part shade[175, 184, 200], growing well in light woodland[200]. Prefers a well-drained soil with plenty of moisture in the growing season[1, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c according to one report[184], whilst others say that it is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1, 11]. It succeeds on a wall at Kew[K] and as a free-standing shrub in Cornwall[11]. The flowers are damaged by frost, so the plant is best grown on a south or west-facing wall[188]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be put into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. Cultivated in Japan for the paper that can be made from the bark[11, 200]. The stems are harvested every second year[61]. This species is very closely related to and scarcely distinct from E. gardneri and E. chrysantha[200]. The flowers diffuse a pronounced clove-like perfume and will scent the air to some distance on a calm day[245]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop: Management: coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Place the pot in a plastic bag to keep it moist[175]. The seed might germinate in the spring, though it could take another 12 months. Stored seed usually requires 8 - 12 weeks warm stratification at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c[175]. Germination can still take 12 months or more at 15°c[175]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, and grow on in a greenhouse for at least a year before planting out in late spring or early summer[175]. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings in spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
