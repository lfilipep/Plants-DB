Asia - Himalayas in Nepal.,(4 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BerberisAristata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BerberisAristata2.jpg",,"Berberis aristata is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3.5 m (11ft 6in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",B. chitria. B. coriaria.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[145]. A well-flavoured fruit, it has a sweet taste with a blend of acid, though there is a slight bitterness caused by the seeds[194, K]. The fruit is much liked by children[194, K]. It is dried and used like raisins in India[2, 3, 177, 183]. The fruit contains about 2.3% protein, 12% sugars, 2% ash, 0.6% tannin, 0.4% pectin[194]. There is 4.6mg vitamin C per 100ml of juice[194].The fruit is about 7mm x 4mm[194] - it can be up to 10mm long[200]. Plants in the wild yield about 650g of fruit in 4 pickings[194]. Flower buds - added to sauces[177, 183].","Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Deobstruent: Clears obstructions from the natural ducts of the body.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antibacterial  Antiperiodic  Bitter  Cancer  Deobstruent  Diaphoretic  Dysentery  Laxative  Malaria  Ophthalmic  Tonic  Vitamin CThe dried stem, root bark and wood are alterative, antiperiodic, deobstruent, diaphoretic, laxative, ophthalmic and tonic (bitter)[46, 61, 158, 194, 240]. An infusion is used in the treatment of malaria, eye complaints, skin diseases, menorrhagia, diarrhoea and jaundice[240, 243]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","A yellow dye is obtained from the root and the stem[46, 61, 272]. An important source of dyestuff and tannin, it is perhaps one of the best tannin dyes available in India[194]. The wood is used as a fuel[146]. The spiny branches are used for making fencing around fields[272].",,"Prefers a warm moist loamy soil and light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very hardy, they survived the severe winters of 1986-1987 without problems in most areas of Britain[K]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely and resprout well from the base[200]. The fruits are sometimes sold in local markets in India[194]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. Most plants cultivated under this name are B. chitria., B. coriaria., B. glaucocarpa. and, more commonly, B. floribunda[67, 200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78]. Stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first winter. Once they are at least 20cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so be careful not to overwater them and keep them well ventilated[113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very difficult, if not impossible. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]. Very difficult, if not impossible.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
