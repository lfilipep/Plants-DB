However, due to its doubtful hardiness it is not a good candidate for this use in Britain.  - moderately hard[146]. Environmental Uses include:    Agroforestry;     Boundary, barrier or support;     Soil improvement. It is used as an Ornamental.",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position[11], succeeding in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200] including limy soils[182]. This species is on the borderline of hardiness in Britain. However, C. japonica, which is considered to be no more than a variety of this species by many botanists, succeeds on a wall at Wisley to the west of London and is said to be hardy to about -10°c[184]. Its natural range is Japan where it grows at heights up to 2000 metres on rocky mountain slopes in the cooler regions of the country[11, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. It has a special soil tolerance for shallow soils.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 12 - 24 hours in warm water and sow in a greenhouse in early spring[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings in sand in a frame[200].",
