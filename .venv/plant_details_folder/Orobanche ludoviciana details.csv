25,Cultivation Details Description,"A fully parasitic plant lacking in chlorophyll depends entirely on its host plant to obtain nutrients [200]. Since A. ludovicianum is an obligate parasite, the conditions for its growth are entirely dependent on the host species.  It is not possible to advocate a regimen for care.  Note: Researchers in North America have attempted the cultivation of several species of  Aphyllon with little success, including A. ludovicianum.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in a pot containing a host plant. The seed is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. It might also be possible to sow the seed in situ around a host plant.,
