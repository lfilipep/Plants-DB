24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds on chalk or clay soils, preferring open habitats in the wild[17, 150]. Tolerates poor soils so long as they are not dry[202]. Succeeds in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200] and also in deep shade though growth is more lax in such a position[202]. Hardy to about -18°c[202]. Plants reproduce sexually and not apomictically like many brambles. Individual plants are self-sterile[17]. This species is a blackberry with biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]."
