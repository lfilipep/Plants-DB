They make a very decorative and tasty addition to the salad bowl[K].","Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Lithontripic  PoulticeThe whole plant has mild medicinal activity similar to the action of garlic (Allium sativum)[222]. It is used specifically as a poultice on the chest for the treatment of respiratory ailments and the juice has been used in the treatment of kidney stones[222]. The juice of the plant is used in treating colds, croup, sore throats etc[257]. A poultice of the plant is applied externally to various infections such as sore throats, sores, swellings, chest and pleurisy pains[257].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent.

Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. A very ornamental plant, it makes a very decorative edging to flower beds[K]. This species is self-sowing quite freely in our Cornwall garden[K]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203], though this species has tolerated considerable neglect in our Cornwall garden[K]. The cultivar 'Major' is a more vigorous form with larger flower clusters[90]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. A widespread and very variable species[1]. It is closely allied to A. stellatum[1, 270]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a bulb.","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. Very easy, the plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season and the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
