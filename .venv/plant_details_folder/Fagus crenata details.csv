0,Fagus crenata,Japanese Beech,Fagaceae,4-8,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, large quantities of the seed of many species in this genus are thought to be toxic.",Forests all over Japan.,E. Asia - Japan.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/FagusCrenata.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/FagusCrenata2.gif",,"Fagus crenata is a deciduous Tree growing to 35 m (114ft 10in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Oil: ","oung leaves - raw[105]. A very nice mild flavour but the leaves quickly become tough so only the youngest should be used. New growth is usually produced for 2 periods of 3 weeks each year, one in spring and one in mid-summer. Edible seed - raw or cooked[105, 177]. Rich in oil. The seed should not be eaten in large quantities, see the notes above on toxicity. It can be dried and ground into a powder. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[105, 177]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Young trees are very shade tolerant, but are subject to frost damage so are best grown in a woodland position which will protect them[200]. Although very cold hardy, this species requires hotter summers than are normally experienced in Britain so is not usually a success here and is very slow growing[200]. Trees have surface-feeding roots and also cast a dense shade. This greatly inhibits the growth of other plants and, especially where a number of the trees are growing together, the ground beneath them is often almost devoid of vegetation.","Seed - the seed has a short viability and is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Protect the seed from mice. Germination takes place in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seedlings are slow growing for the first few years and are very susceptible to damage by late frosts. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in the autumn. The seedlings can be left in the open ground for three years before transplanting, but do best if put into their final positions as soon as possible and given some protection from spring frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
