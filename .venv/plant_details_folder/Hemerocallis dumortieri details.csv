23,Other Uses Description,The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205]. Plants form a slowly spreading clump and are suitable for ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. The dead leaves should be left on the ground in the winter to ensure effective cover[208].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeding in sun or shade, it produces more flowers in a sunny position though these flowers can be shorter-lived in very sunny positions[205]. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. This species is hardy to about -20°c[187]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Individual flowers only live for one day[205]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Plants form a tight clump that spreads slowly[K]. The roots are cylindrical[205]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
