Both the leaves and flowers are used medicinally, although the leaves have a stronger action than the flowers [310 ]. They are antiamoebic, astringent, febrifuge and galactofuge [310 ]. A decoction is used internally as a treatment for fever [310 ]. An infusion is employed to treat pulmonary catarrh, bronchitis, and asthma [310 ]. A poultice of the leaves is applied externally to treat skin complaints and wounds [310 ]. The bruised leaves or flowers are used as a poultice to the breasts of lactating women to discourage breast milk production [310, 345 ]. An infusion of the flowers is applied to the eyelids as a decongestant [310 ]. The stems are employed as an antipyretic and in the treatment of abscesses [310 ]. A tincture made from the root is said to have very strong sedative, anaesthetic and vulnerary properties [310 ]. The root is given fresh to treat fevers and venereal diseases [310 ].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Jasminum sambac succeeds in lowland areas of the tropics and subtropics. Plants can only tolerate occasional light frosts[423 ]. It succeeds in full sun and partial shade[352, 423 ] and requires moist but well-drained soil[352, 423 ]. Jasminum sambac prefers light soil that is rich in organic matter[423 ]. A pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. The average annual flower yield is 1 - 7 tonnes per hectare, and the essential oil yield is 0.1 - 0.2%[310 ]. Jasmine flowers are picked manually between dawn and 10 a.m., during the hot season in India, even between 3 - 8 a.m. Preferably only half-opened and fresh, fully opened flowers must be picked, not buds or old (yellowish) flowers, as these will depress the essential oil quality. Although rain makes the flowers almost useless, picking flowers in the rain should continue to promote further flowering [310 ]. An experienced picker can harvest 0.5 kg flowers per hour, but the pickers are usually young women and children, who achieve 2 kg in 5 hours [310 ]. Jasmine flowers must be quickly processed since delay substantially reduces essential oil content. Flowers should be kept shaded and cool between picking and processing, and the processing facility should be close to the plantation. Freshly picked flowers can be stored in polythene bags at 15°c without yield loss, quality or odour[310 ]. Jasmine oil can be obtained from flowers by steam distillation, but the yield is very low. Jasmine concrete is obtained from flowers, formerly by enfleurage, currently by solvent extraction. In solvent extraction, flowers are washed up to 3 times with petroleum ether or, preferably, with hydrocarbon-free food-grade hexane; the extract is then distilled to remove the solvent, resulting in the concrete. Concrete is usually produced at the plantation, but absolute is produced where convenient, often in another country[310 ]. Plants can flower all year round[352 ]. The flowers are exceptionally fragrant[352 ]. This species is the national flower of the Philippine Islands[352 ]. Jasminum sambac contains dotriacontanoic acid, dotriacontanol, oleanolic acid, daucosterol, hesperidin, and [+]-jasminoids A, B, C, D in its roots. Leaves contain flavonoids such as rutin, quercetin and isoquercetin, flavonoids rhamnoglycosides as well as a-amyrin and ß-sitosterol. A novel plant cysteine-rich peptide family named jasmintides were isolated from this plant.  Cultivars of Jasminum sambac include: 'Maid of Orleans', 'Belle of India', Grand Duke of Tuscany','Butt Mograw','Mysore Mallige','Arabian Nights'.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed does not require pre-treatment and is best sown in a partially shaded position as soon as ripe [423 ]. Cuttings 12 - 20cm long should be taken from terminal shoots; treatment with a root stimulator increases the strike rate [310 ]. Semi-ripe cuttings, 8cm long, placed in a sandy medium, usually root within four weeks [423 ]. Cuttings taken from shoot tips have given better results than semi-ripe cuttings. They are generally treated with a fungicide, placed in prepared planting holes and watered [310 ]. Layering in the field is done with one-year-old shoots; a slanting cut is made approximately halfway through the shoot, some 50cm from the end; the cut is buried about 10 - 15cm deep with the top remaining above ground. After about 4 - 6 months, the rooted layers can be separated from the parent plant and transplanted [310 ].",
