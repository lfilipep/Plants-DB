22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Rock garden, Specimen. An easily grown and very tolerant plant, it succeeds in most positions in any good soil in sun or partial shade[79, 233]. Succeeds in dense shade. Prefers a moist soil[4] but succeeds in dry soils and, once established, is drought tolerant[190]. Thrives in a bog garden[188]. Requires a well-drained soil containing some lime[1] and succeeds on pure chalk[233]. Established plants are tolerant of considerable neglect and can survive dense weed competition[K]. The evergreen leaves are not very hardy, being killed back by cold winds around -15°c[187], though the rootstock is much hardier and the plant soon recovers in spring. A good plant for woodland edges[24]. Plants often self-sow[208, K]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[190]. The crushed leaves emit a strong odour which, at a distance, resembles hot roast beef[4]. On closer acquaintance the scent becomes disagreeable[4]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Special Features:Flowers have an unpleasant odor, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is it is ripe in a cold frame[4]. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame, it may take 18 months to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division, best done in July after flowering. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
