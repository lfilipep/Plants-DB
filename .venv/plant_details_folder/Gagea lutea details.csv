24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist soil, preferring one on the alkaline side of neutral, and succeeding in sun or shade. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -10°c[214]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Sow the seed thinly so that there is no need to transplant them, and grow the seedlings on in the same pot in the greenhouse for their first year or two. Give an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs when the plants are dormant, placing 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another year or two in the greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant. Division. We have no details of when is the best time to divide the bulbs but suggest doing it after the leaves die down in the summer."
