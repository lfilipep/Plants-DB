Succeeds in any well-drained low-fertility soil so long as it is in a sunny position[200]. A very ornamental plant, it is occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves[1, 264]. It is not very hardy in Britain and will be killed even by a light frost[264]. It is, therefore, usually grown as a half-hardy annual, being sown in a greenhouse in the spring and used for summer bedding[52]. Plants have few problems with pests or diseases though the young plants are prone to root rot and damping off unless given plenty of ventilation and dry growing conditions[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse, only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are prone to damp off so should not be over watered and should be kept in a very sunny well-ventilated position[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
