18,Edible Uses,"Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"ntThe flower buds are pickled and used as a substitute for capers[4, 46, 183, 244]. They can also be added to salads[183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. The tender green tops of the plant have been used like hops to give a bitter flavour to beer and to render it more intoxicating[4, 183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[2, 4, 115, 183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiarrhythmic: Helps restore normal rhythm and conduction,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Vasoconstrictor: Narrows the blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiarrhythmic  Antirheumatic  Cardiotonic  Cathartic  Diuretic  Emetic  VasoconstrictorBroom is a bitter narcotic herb that depresses the respiration and regulates heart action[238]. It acts upon the electrical conductivity of the heart, slowing and regulating the transmission of the impulses[254]. The young herbaceous tips of flowering shoots are cardiotonic, cathartic, diuretic, emetic and vasoconstrictor[4, 13, 21, 46, 165]. The seeds can also be used[4]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of heart complaints, and is especially used in conjunction with Convallaria majalis[238]. The plant is also strongly diuretic, stimulating urine production and thus countering fluid retention[254]. Since broom causes the muscles of the uterus to contract, it has been used to prevent blood loss after childbirth[254]. Use this herb with caution since large doses are likely to upset the stomach[4, 21]. The composition of active ingredients in the plant is very changeable, this makes it rather unreliable medicinally and it is therefore rarely used[9]. This herb should not be prescribed to pregnant women or patients with high blood pressure[238]. Any treatment with this plant should only be carried out under expert supervision[9]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The young herbaceous tips of flowering shoots are harvested in spring, generally in May[4]. They can be used fresh or dried[4, 238]. They should not be stored for more than 12 months since the medicinally active ingredients break down[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"An excellent fibre is obtained from the bark, it is used in the manufacture of paper, cloth and nets[4, 100, 115]. It is not as strong as the fibre from the Spanish broom (Spartium junceum)[4]. The fibre is obtained from the root according to other reports[13, 46]. The bark fibre is used to make paper, it is 2 - 9mm long[189]. The branches are harvested in late summer or autumn, the leaves removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The fibres are cooked for 3 hours in lye then put in a ball mill for 3 hours. The paper is pale tan in colour[189]. The bark is a good source of tannin[4]. A yellow and a brown dye are obtained from the bark[46]. A yellow dye is obtained from the flowering stem[169]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves and young tops[4]. The branches are used to make baskets, brushes, brooms and besoms[4, 6, 13, 46, 55, 115]. They are also sometimes used for thatching roofs and as substitutes for reeds in making fences or screens[4]. An essential oil from the flowers is used in perfumery[57]. Growing well on dry banks and on steep slopes, it is an effective sand binder and soil stabiliser[4, 11, 46].  is one of the first plant to colonize sand dunes by the coast[4]. The plant attracts insects away from nearby plants[14]. The var. prostratus (= C. scoparius maritimus?[208]) makes a good fast growing ground cover plant to 30cm tall, though it needs weeding in its first year[197]. The cultivar 'Andreanus Prostratus' can also be used[208].  - very hard, beautifully veined[4]. The plant seldom reaches sufficient size for its wood to be of much value, but larger specimens are valued by cabinet makers and for veneer[4].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",

Succeeds in most soils, preferring a fairly good but not rich soil[11]. Prefers a poor well-drained soil[14]. Succeeds in slightly acid, neutral and limy soils but dislikes shallow soils over chalk[200]. Plants are strongly calcifuge according to other reports and intolerant of a pH much above 6.5[17, 186]. Prefers a sunny position but tolerates some shade[11, 14, 17]. Plants succeed in exposed conditions, and are very tolerant of maritime exposure[4, K]. Plants have a deep root system, they are very drought tolerant once established and grow well on dry banks[4, 11]. Tolerates a smoky atmosphere, growing well in polluted areas[186]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. New leaves are formed in April but these soon drop off the plant, photosynthesis being carried out by means of the green stems[186]. Very tolerant of cutting, it regenerates quickly from the base[186]. Plants are usually killed by fire but the seeds quickly germinate after the fire and rapidly become established[186]. A good bee plant and food plant for many caterpillars[24, 30, 46], it provides the food for the larvae of the green hairstreak butterfly[186]. Ants are attracted to the seeds, feeding on the juicy attachment that holds them to the pods and thus distributing the seed[186]. Dislikes root disturbance, especially when more than 20cm tall[11]. It is best to plant out into their permanent positions as early as possible. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[80]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water then cold stratify for 1 month and sow in a cold frame[80]. The seed usually germinates in 4 weeks at 20°c[98, 113]. Seedlings should be potted up as soon as possible since plants quickly become intolerant of root disturbance[186]. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late summer if they have made sufficient growth, otherwise in late spring of the following year[K]. The seed has a long viability[186]. Seed can also be sown in situ as soon as it is ripe in the late summer and autumn[4]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 4 - 7 cm with a heel, August in a frame[11]. Produces roots in the spring[11]. Pot up as soon as possible[11]. Cuttings of mature wood, October/November in a frame. Layering.",
