Succeeds in moderate sun to fairly deep shade so long as the top growth can climb towards the light. Prefers a neutral to acid soil, usually found on more or less clay soils in the wild[ 748 ]. In some areas where it grows it is subject to periodic inundation of the soil[ 748 ]. Some forms of this plant do not produce seed, probably as a result of long term cultivation with propagation by cuttings[ 748 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[].",
