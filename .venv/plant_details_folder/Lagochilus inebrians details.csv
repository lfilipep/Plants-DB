The main problem it is likely to face is with our cool damp weather. It comes from a sunny and fairly arid region of the world with a continental climate and so it is likely to require a very sunny position in a well-drained dry soil.",Seed - We have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from winter rain[K].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
