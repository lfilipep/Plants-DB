24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though it experiences very cold winters in its native range[192] and so should be completely cold-hardy in this country. The main problem it is likely to face is with our cool damp weather. It comes from a sunny and fairly arid region of the world with a continental climate and so it is likely to require a very sunny position in a well-drained dry soil."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - We have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the spring. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from winter rain[K].
