(This report does not make clear what it means by blanching, it could be excluding light from the growing shoots or immersing in boiling water[K].)","Grassy places near the sea[58, 187].",E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from August to September, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",H. littorea.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Meadow; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[105, 177]. They can be dried and used as a thickener in soups etc. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]. Root - raw or cooked. A pleasant nutty flavour. This sub-species has a fibrous root system[205].","Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Attractive flowers.,,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil and a sunny position[200] but tolerating partial shade[88]. Plants flower less freely in a shady position though the flowers can last longer in such a position[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[187]. The plant has a fibrous root system[205]. Individual flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and withering in the evening. The plant, however, produces a succession of flowers over a period of about 6 weeks[205]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Unlike the type species, this form does produce viable seed[187]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[200]. They can then spread quite freely[K]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200].","Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
