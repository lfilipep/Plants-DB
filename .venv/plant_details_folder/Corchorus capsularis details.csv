It is in flower in August, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[1, 2, 27, 46, 61]. Young leaves are added to salads whilst older leaves are cooked as a pot-herb[2, 183, 272]. High in protein. The dried leaves can be used as a thickener in soups[183]. A tea is made from the dried leaves[183]. Immature fruits are added to salads or used as a potherb."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  Cardiac  Carminative  Demulcent  Dysentery  Laxative  Stimulant  StomachicThe leaves are appetizer, carminative, demulcent, laxative, stimulant and stomachic[240]. An infusion is used in the treatment of dysentery, fevers, dyspepsia and liver disorders[240]. A decoction of the roots and unripe fruits is used in the treatment of dysentery[240]. The seeds contain a substance that has a similar action on the heart to digitalin (from Digitalis spp.), but less intense in its action[240]."
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre is obtained from the stems, it is the main source of jute[46, 61, 200]. The fibre is somewhat coarse and is used mainly for sackcloth etc[57]. The stems are harvested when the plant is in flower and are then retted (allowed to begin to rot) so that the fibre can be extracted[171]. This species tends to branch making fibre extraction more difficult[114]. Growing the plants very close together will prevent some of the branching. If used in making paper, the fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then ball milled for 4½ hours. The paper is grey/buff[189]. The very light and soft wood is used in making sulphur matches[158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a very fertile soil and a hot humid climate[169]. Tolerates very wet conditions according to one report[57] whilst another says that it does not tolerate waterlogged soils[169]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.1 to 6.8. Jute is sometimes cultivated for the fibre in its stem and also for its edible leaves[183]. It makes an excellent spinach substitute in areas with hot summers[183]. This species is not hardy in Britain but it can be grown as a half-hardy annual here, though it grows much better in areas that are warmer than typical summers in this country[27]. Some reports say that this plant is an annual whilst one says that it is perennial. Since the plant is not hardy in Britain we can only grow it as an annual. This species is very closely related to C. olitorius."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring, after the last expected frosts[200]. In areas with hot summers it should be possible to sow the seed in situ in mid spring."
