0,Eucalyptus piperita,Sydney Peppermint,Myrtaceae,9-11,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269].","Found in most soils, especially if they are on the poor side[154], it prefers sandstone soils on the cool sides of valleys and ridges[152].",Australia - New South Wales.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Tender,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusPiperita.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EucalyptusPiperita2.gif",,"Eucalyptus piperita is an evergreen Tree growing to 18 m (59ft 1in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Bog Garden;,None known,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.StomachicEucalyptus leaves are a traditional Aboriginal herbal remedy. The essential oil found in the leaves is a powerful antiseptic and is used all over the world for relieving coughs and colds, sore throats and other infections[254]. The essential oil is a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold remedies[254]. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is stomachic[152].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The leaves yield up to 0.8% essential oil[154]. This oil is rich in piperitone, which can be used in the synthesis of the medically active menthol, though it is not known whether this is commercially feasible[4].  - hard, straight grained but liable to gum veins. It makes a good fuel[154].",,"Prefers a sunny position in a moderately fertile well-drained moisture retentive circum-neutral soil[200]. Tolerates poor and dry soils, especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. This species does not stand heavy frosts or hot dry climates[154]. It is unlikely to be very hardy in Britain but might succeeds outdoors in the mildest parts of the country. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions[200]. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200]. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200]. Trees respond well to coppicing[154]. Plants are shallow-rooting and, especially in windy areas, should be planted out into their permanent positions when small to ensure that they do not suffer from wind-rock[245]. They strongly resent root disturbance and should be container grown before planting out into their permanent position[11]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are a good bee crop[200].","Seed - surface sow February/March in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11, 78, 134]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2°c[200]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in June, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
