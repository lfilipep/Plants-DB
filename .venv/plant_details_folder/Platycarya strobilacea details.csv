24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist humus-rich loam and a sunny sheltered position[200]. Trees are hardy to about -12°c in Britain[200], but they are not usually a success in our climate[1], preferring a warm dry continental climate[200]. A tree in Hampshire is growing and fruiting well[11]. A tree at Kew flowered heavily in the hot summer of 1989[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Layering[200]."
