21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The plant appears to be immune to a very destructive form of foot rot, supposed to be caused by the brown-rot fungus (Phytophthora citrophthora). This fungus attacks the lower trunks and upper roots of various species of Citrus that are grown in the Congo, including the sour orange, Citrus aurantium, which is usually found to be very resistant to foot rot. It appears that, in the Congo, foot rot is greatly aggravated in severity by the larvae of a longhorn beetle, Monohammus sp., which attacks first the cambium layer and later the wood of the base of the trunk. This species, besides being immune to the attacks of the foot-rot fungus, is not attacked by this beetle. It has been found that the plant makes an excellent rootstock for the cultivated varieties of sweet orange, mandarin, grapefruit, and lemon which were all found to grow more vigorously when grafted on to it when compared to their performance on sour orange rootstocks. Furthermore, citrus trees grafted on the rootstocks of this species were completely immune to the Monohammus beetle and also to foot rot, provided the grafts were made high enough above the ground to prevent infection from the soil[ 319 ].",
