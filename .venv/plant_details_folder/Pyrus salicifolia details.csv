Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. The dormant plant is very frost resistant[74]. A very ornamental plant[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, it will then usually germinate in mid to late winter. Stored seed requires 8 - 10 weeks cold stratification at 1°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[200]. Temperatures over 15 - 20°c induce a secondary dormancy in the seed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year."
