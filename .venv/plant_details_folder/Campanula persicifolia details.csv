18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 105]. Rich in vitamin C[74]. A mild flavour, it is nice in salads and is liked by most people who try it[K]. The plant forms over-wintering basal rosettes of leaves and thus provides a source of fresh leaves throughout the winter[K]. The main problem with these leaves is that they are very narrow and it takes quite a lot of picking in order to obtain a reasonable quantity[K]. Root - raw[74]. Flowers - raw. A pleasant sweetness, and a very ornamental addition to mixed salads[K].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in ordinary garden soil[187]. Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in light woodland[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[187]. It was at one time grown as a culinary vegetable, but is now only grown as an ornamental plant[4]. The sub-species C. persicifolia crystalocalyx has larger leaves than the species and so is more suitable as a food crop[K]. A very long-lived and easily grown plant[187], it is best divided every other year[111]. Slugs are very fond of this plant and can cause severe damage even to large plants[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. This plant is a potential winter salad plant, it retains a basal rosette of leaves all winter[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",
