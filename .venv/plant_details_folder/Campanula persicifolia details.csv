The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. crystalocalyx.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 105]. Rich in vitamin C[74]. A mild flavour, it is nice in salads and is liked by most people who try it[K]. The plant forms over-wintering basal rosettes of leaves and thus provides a source of fresh leaves throughout the winter[K]. The main problem with these leaves is that they are very narrow and it takes quite a lot of picking in order to obtain a reasonable quantity[K]. Root - raw[74]. Flowers - raw. A pleasant sweetness, and a very ornamental addition to mixed salads[K].",Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Vitamin CNone known,,None known,,"Easily grown in ordinary garden soil[187]. Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in light woodland[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[187]. It was at one time grown as a culinary vegetable, but is now only grown as an ornamental plant[4]. The sub-species C. persicifolia crystalocalyx has larger leaves than the species and so is more suitable as a food crop[K]. A very long-lived and easily grown plant[187], it is best divided every other year[111]. Slugs are very fond of this plant and can cause severe damage even to large plants[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. This plant is a potential winter salad plant, it retains a basal rosette of leaves all winter[K].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
