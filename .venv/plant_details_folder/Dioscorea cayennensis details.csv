It is a commercially cultivated for its roots that have a rough outer skin and pale yellow flesh. It is cooked and eaten as vegetable. It can also be dried and milled to produce flour. Leaves are made into tea.
14,Physical Characteristics,"Dioscorea cayennensis is an evergreen Perennial Climber growing to 10 m (32ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind, Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - cooked in various ways and eaten as a vegetable[ 300 , 301 ]. A palatable flavour with a dry, mealy flesh[ 301 ]. The roots are sometimes dried and milled to produce a flour for storing - this flour is then stirred into boiling water and kneaded to form a paste[ 299 ]. The roots have a rough outer skin and a pale yellow flesh[ 301 ].The roots are up to 3kg in weight[ 300 ]. The roots can contain up to 91% carbohydrate, the highest for any yam[ 332 ]. Protein content is low, about 2.5%[ 332 ]. A tea is made from the leaves[ 301 ]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist, lowland tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 32°c, but can tolerate 12 - 40°c[ 418 ]. Plants can be killed at temperatures of 9°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,900mm, but tolerates 900 - 3,000mm[ 418 ]. It prefers a dry season of 2 months or less[ 300 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in moderate shade[ 418 ]. For best yields, this species requires a deep, well-drained, sandy loam that is not liable to water-logging[ 300 ]. Succeeds in relatively light sandy soils[ 300 ], though the soil needs to be very fertile otherwise yields can be low[ 299 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 6.7, tolerating 5.3 - 8[ 418 ]. Daylengths of more than 12 hours are preferred during the early growing season since this encourages vegetative growth; daylengths of less than 12 hours towards the end of the growing season will encourage tuber formation and development[ 300 ]. Requiring a longer growing season than other yams, mature roots are formed in 9 - 12 months from planting[ 300 ]. The tuber has a very brief resting period and does not store well[ 332 ]. It is in fact best stored, if necessary, in the earth[ 332 ]. The tubers are formed near the surface of the soil[ 332 ] and can be carefully removed from the growing plant without disturbing it, allowing the plant to continue cropping for up to three years[ 300 ]. The tubers can be dug up as required and a common practice is to expose one side of the tuber and to cut away the distal part for consumption leaving the upper part to regenerate; hence the name 'cut-and-come-again'[ 332 ]. This practice may be repeated for upward of three years[ 332 ]. Yields of 30 tonnes per hectare have been obtained in the Caribbean[ 300 ]. There are some named varieties[ 300 ]. Although occasionally monoecious, the plant is usually dioecious, therefore both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[ 299 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - rarely produced, they are not normally used to propagate this species. Cuttings of tubers. Small tubers can be cut into 2 - 4 sections, larger ones into 6 - 8 sections. Each section should have 2 - 3 dormant buds. The cut tuber is often left in the sun for several hours to promote wound healing and reduce the risk of fungal infection[ 300 ]."
