The roots are usually peeled before being eaten[257]. Pollen[62]. Rich in protein, it can be added to flour when making bread, cakes etc. Seed[62, 257]. Small and fiddly to utilize. White stem bases and tender young shoots - raw or cooked[257]. Harvested in the spring[161], they are crisp and sweet[212]. New shoots form in the autumn and make a welcome snack[212].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.HaemostaticThe stem pith is haemostatic[257]. A poultice of the pith is placed under a dressing in order to stop the wound bleeding[257]. The roots have been chewed as a preventative to thirst[257].,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making paper[189]. The fresh stems can be harvested in summer, or dried stems can be used at any time of the year. The stems are split and cut into usable pieces, soaked for 24 hours in clear water and then cooked for 1½ hours with lye. The fibres are then beaten in a blender and can be used to make a beige/brown paper[189]. The stems and leaves are used for weaving or sewing together into hats, mats, mattresses etc[61, 189, 257]. The stems are very durable and take a year or more to decay in the wild[212]. The stems have been used in basket making[257]. The outer surface of the stems has been split and twisted into weft cords and warp[257].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any wet to moisture retentive ground, pond margins and shallow water in full sun or shade[200].","Seed - sow in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in a pot standing in 3cm of water. Only just cover the seed with soil[200]. The seed usually germinates fairly quickly. Prick out the plants when large enough to handle and plant out in their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
