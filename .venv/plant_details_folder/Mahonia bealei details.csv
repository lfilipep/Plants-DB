14,Physical Characteristics,"Mahonia bealei is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to March, and the seeds ripen from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A pleasant acid flavour, it is nice when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. The fruit is about 10mm long and 6mm wide[200], it ripens in April/May and if the plant is in a sheltered position the crops can be fairly heavy[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antiphlogistic  Antirheumatic  Cancer  Depurative  Dysentery  Febrifuge  TonicThe leaf is febrifuge and tonic[218]. A decoction of the root and stems is antiphlogistic, antirheumatic, depurative and febrifuge[147, 218]. A decoction is used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, recurring fever and cough in rundown body systems, rheumatoid arthritis, backache, weak knees, dysentery and enteritis[147]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Pest tolerant, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen, Woodland garden. Thrives in any good garden soil[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Survives under quite heavy tree cover[11], thriving in dense shade[182]. Prefers a semi-shaded woodland position in a damp, slightly acid to neutral humus-rich soil[200]. The fully dormant plant is hardy to about -20°c[184], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Scarcely distinct from M. japonica[11, 200], differing mainly in its broader leaflets which are placed closer together on the stem and its erect flower racemes[245]. It is often treated as a subspecies of M. japonica, despite the fact that this species is found in the wild whilst M. japonica is a cultigen and not a wild plant[11, 200]. Plants of the two species are often confused in cultivation. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11]. Leaf cuttings in the autumn.",
