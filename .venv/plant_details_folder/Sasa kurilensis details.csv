See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Arundinaria kurilensis. Bambusa kurilensis.

They are so popular in Japan that a license is required in order to collect them[183]. Seed - used as a cereal[177].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerA potential cure for cancer has been discovered in the leaf[195].,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The plant has rampant roots and this can be utilized in soil stabilization schemes[195]. The canes are used for making particle boards such as hardboard[195]. The fibre dimensions mean that it is more suitable for thick paper and fibreboard than for thin papers[195]. Yields in Japan are around 45 tonnes per hectare though the cost of gathering and bundling the canes makes economic use problematic[195]. The canes are also used as plant supports etc. The plant has rampant roots and used as a tough, vigorous groundcover for difficult sites.",,"Prefers a damp humus rich soil in partial shade[200]. A very hardy species, it grows wild further north than any other bamboo, succeeding even in areas with heavy snow[195]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -20°c[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. A polymorphic species[200]. There is at least one named form, selected for its ornamental value[200]. The rootstock can be rampant and invasive[200], it is said to hamper the regeneration of forests in its native habitat[195]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - if possible, surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Stored seed is best sown as soon as it is received. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could be a few years. Plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division in late spring as new growth commences. Take large divisions, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main clump as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Divisions of less than 5 - 6 culms rarely succeed[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
