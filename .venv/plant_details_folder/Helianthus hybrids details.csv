0,Helianthus hybrids,Perennial Sunflower,Asteraceae,4-11,None Known,Cold to semi-arid regions.,Origin: hybrid. All Helianthus species are native to North America except for three species in South America.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Tender,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Helianthus_hybrids1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Helianthus_hybrids2.JPEG",Sunflowers are usually tall annual or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of 3m or more. Perennial sunflowers have protein and oil-rich seeds. Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1].,"Helianthus hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 3.6 m (11ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Many.

Some sunflowers  are a good source of biomass. The tubers are used in industry to make alcohol etc[141]. The alcohol fermented from the tubers is said to be of better quality than that from sugar beets[269]. Can be grown as a temporary summer screen[200]. Ornamental.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.","Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein-oil  Under DevelopmentClimate: boreal to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid.

Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1].  Several perennial sunflowers are being worked with including prairie natives handling boreal to warm temperate semi-arid conditions: Helianthus maximliani (Maximilian sunflower), Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke), Helianthus pauciflorus (Stiff sunflower). Less tolerant of boreal conditions but good on poor soils is Helianthus cusickii ( Cusick's sunflower) [1-1].",See individual species.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
