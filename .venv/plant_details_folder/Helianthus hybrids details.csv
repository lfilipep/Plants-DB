13,Summary,Sunflowers are usually tall annual or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of 3m or more. Perennial sunflowers have protein and oil-rich seeds. Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1].
14,Physical Characteristics,"Helianthus hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 3.6 m (11ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."
15,Synonyms,Many. See individual species.
16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Oil: "
19,Edible Uses Description,arbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: protein-oil (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1].
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Various medicinal qualities depending on the species.
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses."
23,Other Uses Description,See individual species. Some sunflowers  are a good source of biomass. The tubers are used in industry to make alcohol etc[141]. The alcohol fermented from the tubers is said to be of better quality than that from sugar beets[269]. Can be grown as a temporary summer screen[200]. Ornamental. A food plants for the larvae of many lepidopterans.
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein-oil  Under DevelopmentClimate: boreal to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: under development. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. Perennial crops are being developed for their oil-seed. The Land Institute see them as part of a perennial polyculture system [1-1].  Several perennial sunflowers are being worked with including prairie natives handling boreal to warm temperate semi-arid conditions: Helianthus maximliani (Maximilian sunflower), Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke), Helianthus pauciflorus (Stiff sunflower). Less tolerant of boreal conditions but good on poor soils is Helianthus cusickii ( Cusick's sunflower) [1-1]."
