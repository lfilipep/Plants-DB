24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,000 metres[303 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 32°c, but can tolerate 12 - 48°c[418 ]. Mature growth can be killed by temperatures of -2°c or lower, whilst young growth is killed at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 6,000mm, but tolerates 800 - 9,900mm[418 ]. Plants can withstand a dry season of up to 6 - 7 months[418 ]. Although it prefers a sunny position, plants are moderately shade-tolerant, especially when young[303 , 418 ]. A very versatile plant able to grow on a wide range of soils, it can even grow on shallow, rocky soils provided the rainfall is sufficient[303 , 418 ]. It tolerates prolonged flooding, and once established, it can tolerate drought[303 ]. In dry sites, it generally confines itself to the vicinity of watercourses[303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418 ]. Plants are tolerant of quite strong winds[310 ]. Trees self-sow freely and may become serious pests in pastures[303 ]. The plant is listed as undesirable in Florida[307 ]. A fast-growing plant[335 , 416 ]. Seedlings may reach a height of 4 metres in only 2 years[303 , 418 ]. The tree coppices remarkably well; vigorous shoots are produced in large numbers from small and large stumps alike. Coppice stands along streams have been reported that grew to 4.6 metres in 4 years[303 ]. The best forms are frequently cultivated in Java and Florida[303 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Summer. Bloom Color: White/Near White. Spacing: over 40 ft. (12 m).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - freshly collected seeds are normally sown in nursery beds at a depth of 20 - 25mm during the rainy season and germinate in 2 - 4 weeks at a rate 20 - 90%[303 ]. Plants are pricked out when 6 - 9 months old into beds 30 x 30 cm[303 ]. For development of seedlings, moisture is even more important than shade, as seedlings in the sun develop well, provided the soil is kept moist, but seedlings in the shade die if the soil is dry[303 ]. Seedlings are somewhat frost tender, particularly on grassy ground, where they are frequently killed back[303. Sapling growth is faster than seedling growth. Seedlings 1-3 years old can be planted out without any difficulty[303 ]. Air-layering. Grafting.",
