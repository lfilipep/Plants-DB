26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in trays standing in shallow water[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in trays of shallow water, planting them out in the summer. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
