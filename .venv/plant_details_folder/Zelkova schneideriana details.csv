The high quality timber is resistant to decay[266].,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in almost any good soil, acid or alkaline, preferring a deep well-drained moist loam[11, 200]. Prefers a moderately sheltered position[11]. Relatively shade tolerant[200]. A fast growing tree[200]. Dormant plants are very cold-tolerant, but they are sometimes damaged by late spring frosts when they are young[11]. Plants are susceptible to Dutch Elm Disease, but the beetle that is the vector of this disease rarely feeds on Zelkova so infestation is rare[11, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed requires stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible[78, 200]. Germination rates are variable[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
