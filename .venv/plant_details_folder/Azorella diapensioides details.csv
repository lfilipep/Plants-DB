0,Azorella diapensioides,Llareta,Apiaceae or Umbelliferae,Coming soon,None known,"Rocky slopes at high altitude, generally around 3,500 - 4,500 metres, in areas of low rainfall, but generally in locations where there is some water seepage[281].",Western S. America - Chile and Peru,(0 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Azorella diapensioides is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) at a slow rate.It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.","Yields a fuel which is virtually smokeless - it is used domestically and commercially[61]. It is only used for firewood because it grows in regions where easier to use fuel crops won't grow. As a result it has become extinct over much of its former range, but it is still common in some of the high altitude national parks in the northern half of Chile (eg, PN Lauca)[281].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a position in full sun in a well-drained gritty soil[200]. Llareta is a woody shrub with tiny tough leaves, in a rounded cushion form of such tight construction that it is frequently mistaken for a moss-covered rock, even on close inspection[281]. In its natural habitat, it tolerates very wide daily temperature swings (at least -25C to +25C), but it probably also requires the dry air and high light intensity of its natural habitat if it is to thrive[281]. It is a very slow growing plant, figures of just 20mm new growth per year have been quoted, so larger specimens of 1 metre or more must be around a century old[281].",Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter in a cold frame. Grow on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse or frame and plant out in late spring.
