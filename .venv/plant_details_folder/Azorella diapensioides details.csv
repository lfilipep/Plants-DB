20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Yields a fuel which is virtually smokeless - it is used domestically and commercially[61]. It is only used for firewood because it grows in regions where easier to use fuel crops won't grow. As a result it has become extinct over much of its former range, but it is still common in some of the high altitude national parks in the northern half of Chile (eg, PN Lauca)[281].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a position in full sun in a well-drained gritty soil[200]. Llareta is a woody shrub with tiny tough leaves, in a rounded cushion form of such tight construction that it is frequently mistaken for a moss-covered rock, even on close inspection[281]. In its natural habitat, it tolerates very wide daily temperature swings (at least -25C to +25C), but it probably also requires the dry air and high light intensity of its natural habitat if it is to thrive[281]. It is a very slow growing plant, figures of just 20mm new growth per year have been quoted, so larger specimens of 1 metre or more must be around a century old[281].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter in a cold frame. Grow on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse or frame and plant out in late spring. Division.,
