Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.","Xanthoceras sorbifolium is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft) by 2.5 m (8ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Flowers - cooked[2, 105, 183]. They are usually boiled[179]. Leaves - cooked[2, 105, 183]. They are usually boiled[179]. Seed - cooked[2, 105, 177]. The seed is about the size of a pea, it is quite sweet[183], with a taste like a sweet chestnut[178]. The seed is husked and then ground into a powder and boiled[179].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Management: Standard  Other Systems: Strip intercrop  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilPrefers a good loamy soil[1], but succeeds in most well-drained fertile soils in a sunny position[184, 200]. Prefers a warm dry situation[184]. Requires protection from cold winds[202]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[184]. They grow best in areas with warm summers and dry springs without late frosts[184], the young growth can be damaged by late spring frosts[1, 11]. They require summer heat in order to fully ripen their wood and to stimulate the production of flower buds[11, 200]. They are subject to attacks by 'coral spot' fungus, particularly if the wood is not fully ripened and is then damaged by winter cold[11]. Flowers are produced on the previous year's wood[202]. Plants are usually slow to become established[202]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2].","Seed - 3 months cool stratification improves germination rates[113] so the seed is probably best sown in a cold frame in the autumn[K]. Another report says that the seed can be sown in a warm greenhouse in February or March[78], probably after stratification[K]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. Grow the on in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse for their first winter then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Consider giving them some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Root cuttings, 3cm long planted horizontally in pots in a frame in December or January. Good percentage[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
