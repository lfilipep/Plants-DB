14,Physical Characteristics,"Campanula glomerata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.6 m (2ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen. Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in sun or partial shade[233]. A very ornamental plant, there are several named forms[200]. This is a very vigorous species and can be invasive, spreading by means of its creeping rootstock, when well suited to its site[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221].  Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. Very easy[221]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Very easy[221]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",
