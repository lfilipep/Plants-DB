22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun[200]. This species only succeeds outdoors in Britain in the mildest areas of the country[11, 182]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. They require a warm south or south-west facing wall in Britain, succeeding in areas where frosts are light and short lived[200]. A good bee plant[167], the flowers are sweetly fragrant[219, 245]. Very ornamental[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. It does not require pre-treatment. When large enough to handle, prick the plants out into individual pots. Grow on the young plants for at least the first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Consider giving the plants some protection from winter cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[219]. They require a little bottom heat if they are to root well[245].",
