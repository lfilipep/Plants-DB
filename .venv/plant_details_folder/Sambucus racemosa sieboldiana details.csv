0,Sambucus racemosa sieboldiana,,Caprifoliaceae,Coming soon,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves and stems of some, if not all, members of this genus are poisonous[9, 76]. The fruit of many species (although no records have been seen for this species) has been known to cause stomach upsets to some people. Any toxin the fruit might contain is liable to be of very low toxicity and is destroyed when the fruit is cooked[65, 76].","Scrub and woods in the hills of W. Hupeh, 300 - 2400 metres[109].","E. Asia - China, Japan, Korea.",(1 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SambucusRacemosaSieboldiana.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SambucusRacemosaSieboldiana2.jpg",,"Sambucus racemosa sieboldiana is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft 1in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Sambucus sieboldiana,,"Young leaves and buds - cooked and used as a vegetable[177, 183]. This use is inadvisable, see the notes above on toxicity. A tea is made from the leaves[177, 183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Tolerates most soils, including chalk[200], but prefers a moist loamy soil[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position[1]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. This species is closely related to S. racemosa[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with a heel, late autumn in a frame or a sheltered outdoor bed[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
