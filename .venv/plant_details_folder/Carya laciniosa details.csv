0,Carya laciniosa,Shellbark Hickory,Juglandaceae,5-9,None known,"Deep rich soils of floodplains and bottomlands[43, 62]. It grows best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils and tolerates shallow flooding in early spring[229].","Eastern N. America - New York and Pennsylvania to Indiana, Iowa and Kansas.",(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CaryaLaciniosa.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CaryaLaciniosa2.jpg","Bloom Color: Yellow.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Rounded.","Carya laciniosa is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft 5in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf from June to October, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. sulcata. Juglans laciniosa.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.","d - raw or cooked in pies, cakes etc[183]. Sweet, with a very fine flavour[183], it has the largest seeds of the hickories[227], up to 5cm long[229]. Probably the finest flavoured hickory[117]. The shell is hard and thick[101, 117] and the cracking quality is poor compared to C. ovata[183]. The seed ripens in late autumn and, when stored in its shell in a cool place, will keep for at least 6 months[K]. Sap - a sweet flavour[62]. Tapped in spring, it can be boiled down to a syrup or sugar and be used in similar ways to maple syrup[101, 183].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Detergent: A cleansing agent, used on wounds etc. It removes dead and diseased matter.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It weighs 50 lb. per cubic foot. An excellent wood, it is used for tool handles, baskets, fuel etc[46, 61, 63, 82, 226, 227]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilLandscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible. Prefers a deep moisture-retentive loam in a sunny sheltered position, requiring a good summer for best development[1, 63, 137, 200]. A very ornamental but slow growing tree[1], it is sometimes cultivated for its edible seed, and is also sold in local markets in N. America[82]. There are some named varieties[183] though some of these are likely to be hybrids. 'Fayette' is a thin shelled form[200]. 'Henry' has a very large nut[200]. Trees have been planted on an experimental scale in Germany for their wood[50]. Hybridizes in the wild with C. ovata[227]. Trees take up to 15 years from seed to bear fruit[117]. Plants are strongly tap-rooted and should be planted in their permanent positions as soon as possible[1, 137]. Sowing in situ would be the best method so long as the seed could be protected from mice[1, 200]. Trees are late coming into leaf (usually late May to June) and lose their leaves early in the autumn (usually in October)[137]. During this time they cast a heavy shade. These factors combine to make the trees eminently suitable for a mixed woodland planting with shrubs and other trees beneath them[137]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Most species in this genus have quite a wide range of distribution and, in order to find trees more suited to this country, seed from the most appropriate provenances should be sought[137]. Most trees growing in Britain at present tend to only produce good seed after hot summers[137]. Trees are self-fertile but larger crops of better quality seeds are produced if cross-pollination takes place[229].  Special Features:North American native, Wetlands plant, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 4. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - requires a period of cold stratification. It is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[78]. Stored seed should be kept moist (but not wet) prior to sowing and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as possible[78]. Where possible, sow 1 or 2 seeds only in each deep pot and thin to the best seedling. If you need to transplant the seedlings, then do this as soon as they are large enough to handle, once more using deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Put the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in their first summer, and give them some protection from the cold for at least the first winter[78, K]. Seed can also be sown in situ so long as protection is given from mice etc and the seed is given some protection from cold[200] (a plastic bottle with the top and bottom removed and a wire mesh top fitted to keep the mice out is ideal)",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
