See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,Fruit: ,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","eaThe following notes are for the closely related M. cerifera. It is assumed that they also apply to this species[K]. Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177, 183]. The fruit is about 2 - 4mm in diameter with a single large seed[200]. There is very little edible flesh and this is of poor quality[K]. Leaves and berries are used as a food flavouring[62, 105, 177]. An attractive and agreeable substitute for bay leaves, used in flavouring soups, stews etc[183]. The dried leaves are brewed into a robust tea[183].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Dysentery  Emetic  Stimulant  TonicThe following notes are for the closely related M. cerifera. It is assumed that they also apply to this species[K]. The root bark is astringent, emetic (in large doses), sternutatory, stimulant and tonic[4, 21, 46, 165, 213]. It is harvested in the autumn, thoroughly dried then powdered and kept in a dark place in an airtight container[4]. It is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, jaundice, fevers, colds, influenza, catarrh, excessive menstruation, vaginal discharge etc[4, 238]. Externally, it is applied to indolent ulcers, sore throats, sores, itching skin conditions, dandruff etc[4, 238]. The wax is astringent and slightly narcotic[4]. It is regarded as a sure cure for dysentery and is also used to treat internal ulcers[4]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of fevers and externally as a wash for itchy skin[222].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wax: Used for making candles etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The following notes are for the closely related M. cerifera. It is assumed that they also apply to this species[K]. A wax covering on the fruit is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water and immersing them for a few minutes, the wax floats to the surface and is then skimmed off. The fruit is then boiled in water to extract the wax from the pulp and once more the wax is skimmed off. It is then strained through a muslin cloth and can be used to make aromatic candles, sealing wax etc[1, 4, 6, 11, 62, 95, 171, 245]. Candles made from this wax are quite brittle but are less greasy in warm weather[213]. They are slightly aromatic, with a pleasant balsamic odour[245], and do not smoke when put out, making them much more pleasant to use that wax or tallow candles[213]. The wax is also used in making soaps[213]. About 1 kilo of wax can be obtained from 4 kilos of berries[4]. A blue dye is obtained from the fruit[6]. The plant can be grown as an informal hedge[200], succeeding in windy sites[K].  - light, soft, brittle, fine-grained[82, 227]. The wood weighs 35lb per cubic foot[227]. It is of no commercial value[229].",,"Prefers a moist soil[200]. Grows well in an open position in a well-drained soil in sun or light shade[200]. Thrives in any ordinary garden soil according to one report[11] whilst another says that it thrives in an acid soil[182]. Prefers a lime-free loamy or peaty soil[1]. Succeeds in dry and maritime climates[200]. Closely related to M. pensylvanica and M. cerifera[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Many species in this genus have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[78]. Stored seed germinates more freely if given a 3 month cold stratification and then sown in a cold frame[78]. Germination is usually good[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame for the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up and overwinter in a cold frame then plant out in late spring or early summer. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
