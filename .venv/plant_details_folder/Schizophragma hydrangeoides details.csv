24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Arbor. Requires a moist leafy soil and some shade at the roots. An easily grown plant[1], it prefers a good loamy soil and plenty of moisture[11]. Succeeds on most soil types, disliking only very alkaline soils[202]. Plants succeed in sun or shade[182], though they prefer full sun[202, 219]. In the hotter parts of Britain they prefer shade from the midday sun[219]. They succeed on north-facing walls[188, 219]. The fully dormant plant is hardy to about -20°c[182, 200]. Plants are slow to establish and slow-growing when young, though they speed up somewhat with age[202]. Plants do not normally require pruning, though any unwanted growth can be removed in the winter[219]. Plants have a similar growth habit to ivy (Hedera helix) climbing trees by means of aerial roots or growing along the woodland floor[1, 182]. Plants might need some help to become attached in their early years[182]. Some named varieties have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter to early spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fair to very good[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out in late spring or early summer. Layering in spring directly into pots. A fair to good percentage[78], though it can be difficult to find suitable low growth[202]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 4 - 5cm with a heel, July in a frame[1, 78]. Keep the cuttings moist[78].",
