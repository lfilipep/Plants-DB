24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"It is said that this species is unsuitable for cultivation in the lowland tropics[262 ]. It is usually grown at elevations between 800 - 3,000 metres in the tropics and down to sea level in the subtropics[262 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 26°c, but can tolerate 16 - 31°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -1°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,200mm, but tolerates 650 - 1,800mm[418 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in the dappled shade[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5.1 - 7.5[418 ]. Plants produce tendrils and climb by attaching these to other plants. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer Mid Summer Late Summer/Early Fall Mid Fall. Bloom Color: Pale Pink Pale Yellow White/Near White. Spacing: 36-48 in. (90-120 cm).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Fresh seed germinates in 10 - 20 days[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24°c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262 ]. Cuttings of fully mature wood taken at a node. They can take 3 months, but there is usually a high percentage[3 ]. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering.",
