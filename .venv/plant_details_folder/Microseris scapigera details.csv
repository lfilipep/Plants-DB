Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"We do not have much information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. The Australian form is said to be hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Plants are likely to require a well-drained soil in a sunny position. This is a polymorphic species that is found in both New Zealand and in Australia. Some botanists have separated off the Australian form as a distinct species, M. lanceolata[44, 157], which is here used as a synonym. An alpine form in the Snowy mountains of Australia has fibrous roots too thin to be worth eating[193]. The plant has been suggested for commercial cultivation in temperate zones for its edible root[193].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring might be possible.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
