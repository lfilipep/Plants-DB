Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,This plant can be grown as a ground cover green manure under tomatoes in the greenhouse. The seed should be sown before planting the tomatoes[87]. It can also be sown under soft fruit and cut once or twice in the summer[87]. Nitrogen Fixer.,,"Succeeds in a moist, well-drained circum-neutral soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds in poor soils. Plants are partially winter hardy[87]. After flowering, the fruiting head grows into the ground, thereby planting the seed. This species grows well in an apple orchard, the trees will produce tastier fruit that stores better[201]. It should not be grown with camellias or gooseberries, however, because it harbours a mite that can cause fruit drop in the gooseberries and premature budding in the camellias[201]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Buttercups growing nearby depress the growth of the nitrogen bacteria by means of a root exudate[201]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in situ. If the seed is in short supply it might be better to sow it in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
