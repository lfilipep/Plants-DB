22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its habitat it should succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country. It is quite possible that Tetradium ruticarpum is the correct name for this species. Judging by the needs of other members of this genus it is probably easily grown in a good loamy soil.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February in a greenhouse. Variable germination rates[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood (preferably forced in a greenhouse), 5 - 8cm with a heel, June to August in a warm greenhouse. Fair to good percentage[78].",
