It is in leaf from March to June, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Bulb - raw or cooked[46, 61, 159]. An early Spring vegetables. Used mainly as a flavouring in salads and savoury dishes[238]. This is one of the best N. American wild species for sweetness and flavour[95]. A mild sweet flavour, resembling leeks[183]. The bulb is rather small, it is up to 12mm wide and 50mm tall[235] and is produced in clusters on a rhizome[200]. Leaves - raw or cooked[62]. The unfolding leaves in spring have a mild sweet flavour, resembling leeks[183]. Flowers - raw. Used as a garnish on salads. A hot onion flavour[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.EmeticThis species probably has most of the medicinal virtues of garlic (Allium sativum) but in a milder form[222, 238]. Traditionally the leaves were used in the treatment of colds and croup, and also as a spring tonic[222, 238]. The warm juice of the leaves and bulb was used externally in the treatment of earaches[222, 238]. A strong decoction of the root is emetic[222].",
22,Other Uses,"Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20]. A good shade plant. Tolerates Juglone (a substance produced by a plant to stunt the growth of another plant).,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1]. Grows well in light moist woodland, where the plant forms large clumps and can become invasive[203, 235]. It is probably best grown in the wild garden[203]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. The leaves die down in early summer before the flowers have fully opened. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. Ephemeral emerging in spring and dying back by summer every year  [1-2]. The root pattern is a bulb.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 12 months, but only makes a root and a small bulb in its first year of growth. Top growth is not produced until the second spring[K]. It is quite possible that if the seed can be sown when it is ripe in early summer, or in the autumn, then this will speed up germination times[K]. Sow the seed thinly in the pots so that the young seedlings can be allowed to grow on undisturbed for their first two years. Apply a liquid feed once a month during the growing season to ensure they do not suffer from mineral deficiency. When the plants are dormant at the end of their second years growth, divide them so that there are 2 - 3 small bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for a further year in the greenhouse and then plant them out when they are dormant. Division in spring. Very easy, the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",
