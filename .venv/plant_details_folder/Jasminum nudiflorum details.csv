Main Bloom Time: Early winter, Late winter, Mid winter. Form: Rounded, Spreading or horizontal, Weeping.","Jasminum nudiflorum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3.6 m (11ft) by 4.5 m (14ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from December to March. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",J. sieboldianum.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover;,None known,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DiaphoreticDiaphoretic[178].,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.","A good soil stabilizer for steep banks, succeeding in shady positions[200]. The sprawling branches make this a good plant for ground cover, the plants should be spaced about 1.8 metres apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Arbor, Cascades, Erosion control, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Screen, Standard. Succeeds in a good well-drained loam[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a good soil and a sunny position but succeeds in shade[11, 28, 49], including on a north facing wall[200]. Tolerates very poor soils, whether acid or alkaline[202]. Tolerates urban pollution[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -15°c[184]. Some winter die-back can be experienced and flowers can be damaged in severe winters but new flowers are usually produced when the weather warms up[202]. A winter-flowering plant, flowering mainly on wood that was produced the previous summer[219]. Pruning can be carried out in early to mid spring once flowering has finished[202, 219]. Removing one third of the oldest growth down to ground level rejuvenates the plant and encourages greater flowering[202]. Unpruned plants tend to become woody and matted with dead stems[219]. The flowers have a delicate mossy perfume[245]. This species does not set seed in British gardens. This might be because all the plants in cultivation stem from one original importation[182]. An ideal plant for growing on shady walls and banks[28, 49]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy. Cuttings of mature wood in November. Layering.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
