See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Albizia gamblei Prain Albizia lucida (Roxb.) Benth. Albizia meyeri Ricker Inga lucidior Steud.

See also Green manures.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Agroforestry Uses: The tree has an open canopy, fixes atmospheric nitrogen and has soil improvement qualities. It is often left when the forest is cleared, especially to provide shade in tea plantations, and is sometimes also planted in such places[404 , 730 ]. Other Uses: The heartwood is brown, with dark streaks and alternating dark and light coloured concentric bands; the sapwood is white. The wood is very hard and of good quality, but is not used in India[146 ]. The wood is used for construction and making furniture[404 , 730 ]. The wood can be used for fuel[404 ].","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height.

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 34c, but can tolerate 6 - 42c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 2,400mm, but tolerates 1,100 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position, but tolerates light shade[418 ]. Succeeds in most soils of moderate fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7.5[418 ]. The tree is a host of the lac insect (Laccifer lacca), the female of which secretes the resin 'lac' that was formerly used to make shellac[730 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].","Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
