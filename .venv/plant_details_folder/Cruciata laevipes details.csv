21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Appetizer  VulneraryThe herb is astringent, diuretic and vulnerary[4]. It is not much used nowadays, but was considered a very good wound herb for both external and internal use[4]. A decoction of the leaves has also been used to treat obstructions of the stomach and bowels, to stimulate the appetite and as a remedy for rheumatism, rupture and dropsy[4]. A number of species in this genus contain asperuloside, a substance that produces coumarin and gives the scent of new-mown hay as the plant dries[238]. Asperuloside can be converted into prostaglandins (hormone-like compounds that stimulate the uterus and affect blood vessels), making the genus of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry[238]."

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in situ as soon as it is ripe in late summer[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring though it may be very slow to germinate[200]. Division in spring or throughout the growing season if the plants are kept well watered[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
