14,Physical Characteristics,"Acer macrophyllum is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes."
19,Edible Uses Description,"ins a certain amount of sugar and can either be used as a drink, or can be concentrated into a syrup by boiling off the water[105, 177, 183]. The syrup is used as a sweetener on many foods. The concentration of sugar is somewhat lower than in the sugar maples (A. saccharum). The tree trunk is tapped in the early spring, the sap flowing better on warm sunny days following a frost. The best sap production comes from cold-winter areas with continental climates. Inner bark[177]. Eaten in small quantities with oil[257]. No more details are given but inner bark is often dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickening in soups etc or mixed with cereals when making bread. The leaves, when wrapped round food during baking, impart a nice flavour to the food[99, 118]. Yellow flower clusters - raw. They are sweet with nectar[183]. Seeds - sprouted and then boiled[226]. The sprouted seeds are generally bitter, but the young shoots are quite sweet and juicy[257]. The seeds are about 6mm long and are produced in small clusters[82]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.TB  TonicAn infusion of the bark has been used in the treatment of TB[257]. The raw sap has been used as a tonic[257].
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.,Scourer: Used for cleaning pots, pans, plates etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are packed around apples, rootcrops etc to help preserve them[18, 20]. A sticky gum obtained from the buds in spring has been mixed with oil and used as a hair tonic[257]. A fibre obtained from the inner bark is used for making scouring pads, rope and crude dresses[99, 118, 257]. It was harvested in the spring and was also used in making baskets[257]. Young stems are used as coarse twine warp and weft in the manufacture of baskets[257].  - light, soft, not strong, close grained. It is highly valued for timber, furniture and indoor use and is also used for carving bowls, veneer etc[46, 61, 82, 99, 118, 229]. It makes an excellent fuel, producing a hot smokeless flame[226]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Aggressive surface roots possible, Pollard, Specimen, Street tree. Of easy cultivation, it prefers a good moist well-drained soil[11] and a position that is at least moderately sunny[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Chlorosis can sometimes develop as a result of iron deficiency when the plants are grown in alkaline soils, but in general maples are not fussy as to soil pH. Growth of young plants is rapid in the wild, slowing down after 40 -50 years with a maximum life span of about 275 years[229]. This species thrives in Britain but it can be cut back in a severe winter if that follows a mild autumn[11]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Most maples are bad companion plants, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20].  Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the following spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours and then stratify for 2 - 4 months at 1 - 8°c. It can be slow to germinate. The seed can be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has dried and produced any germination inhibitors) and sown immediately. It should germinate in late winter. If the seed is harvested too soon it will produce very weak plants or no plants at all[80, 113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 20cm or more tall before planting them out in their permanent positions. Layering, which takes about 12 months, is successful with most species in this genus. Cuttings of young shoots in June or July. The cuttings should have 2 - 3 pairs of leaves, plus one pair of buds at the base. Remove a very thin slice of bark at the base of the cutting, rooting is improved if a rooting hormone is used. The rooted cuttings must show new growth during the summer before being potted up otherwise they are unlikely to survive the winter."
