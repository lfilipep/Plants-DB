26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it would probably be worthwhile sowing the seed outdoors in situ in the spring. Division of rooted runners. Probably best done in spring but can be done at any time in the growing season if the plants are kept moist.",
