24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The subspecies C. fontanum grandiflorum is an annual, though subspecies C. fontanum vulgare is a short-lived perennial[266]. It is likely to require a moist soil in light shade.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring might be possible.",
