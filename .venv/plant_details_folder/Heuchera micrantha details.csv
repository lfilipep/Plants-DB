Prefers a well-drained fairly rich and not too heavy soil[111]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[187]. Apt to hybridize with other members of this genus[111]. This species is probably best treated as a sub-species of H. micrantha.","Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination is usually fairly rapid. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. The seed can also be sown in the middle of spring in an outdoor seedbed and planted out in early summer. Alternatively, you can sow the seed in an outdoor seedbed in the middle of summer for planting out in the following spring. Division in March or October[1, 111]. It is best to divide the plants in August or early September, making sure that the woody roots are planted quite deeply with only the crown of foliage above the ground[233].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
