Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antiseborrheic  Astringent  Lithontripic  Miscellany  Salve  Sedative  StomachicThe bark is antirheumatic, astringent, lithontripic, salve and sedative[172]. Moxa is prepared from the plant and is regarded as an effective remedy in all painful diseases[4]. No more details are given, but it is likely that the moxa is prepared from yellow fungous excretions of the wood, since the same report gives this description when talking about other members of the genus[K]. A compound decoction of the leaves has been used in the treatment of stomach ache and intestinal discomfort[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling."

An infusion of the plant is used as a hair conditioner and dandruff treatment[172]. A yellow dye is obtained from the leaves[4]. The plant has been used as a tinder, even when wet, and for cooking fires when there is a lack of larger wood[257]. It is likely that the bark was used for tinder[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained loamy soil in a sheltered position[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Grows well in moist places or the heath garden[182]. Shade tolerant[200]. This species is native to areas with very cold winters and often does not do well in milder zones. It can be excited into premature growth in mild winters and this new growth is susceptible to frost damage[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[50]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a light position in a cold frame[78, 80, 113, 134]. Only just cover the seed and place the pot in a sunny position[78, 80, 134]. Spring sown seed should be surface sown in a sunny position in a cold frame[113, 134]. If the germination is poor, raising the temperature by covering the seed with glass can help[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If you have sufficient seed, it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed, either as soon as it is ripe or in the early spring - do not cover the spring sown seed. Grow the plants on in the seedbed for 2 years before planting them out into their permanent positions in the winter[78, 80, 113, 134]."
