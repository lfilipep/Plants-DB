It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw, cooked or dried for later use. The leaves have a mild onion flavour and are an excellent addition to mixed salads, they can also be used as a flavouring in soups etc[90, 105]. This form has a stronger garlic flavour than common chives[183] The leaves are often available from late winter and can continue to produce leaves until early the following winter, especially if the plant is in a warm, sheltered position[K]. A good source of sulphur and iron[201]. The bulbs are rather small but can be used as spring onions[K]. They can be harvested with the leaves still attached and be used as spring onions[K]. They have a pleasant mild onion flavour. The flowers can be used as a garnish in salads etc[183]. The flowers of this species are rather dry and less desirable than the flowers of many other species[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  Digestive  Hypotensive  TonicThe whole plant has a beneficial effect on the digestive system and the blood circulation. It improves the appetite, is digestive, hypotensive and tonic[201]. It has similar properties to garlic (A. sativum), but in a much milder form, and it is rarely used medicinally[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Fungicide: Arrests the growth of, or kills, fungi.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The juice of the plant is used as an insect repellent, it also has fungicidal properties and is effective against scab, mildew etc[14, 18, 20]. The growing plant is said to repel insects and moles[14, 20].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[203], it prefers a sunny position in a rich moist but well-drained soil[14, 37]. Succeeds in most soils[1, 37] and in light shade[203]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[203]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 8.3. This is a more robust form of A. schoenoprasum, the chive. It is often grown in the garden for its edible leaves which are available from late winter to the beginning of the next winter[K]. The bulbs divide rapidly and large clumps are quickly formed. There are some named varieties[183]. Regular cutting of the leaves ensures a continuous supply of young leaves and prevents flowering[33]. Plants can be moved into a frame or other protected environment in the autumn and will then produce leaves throughout the winter[33]. Do not do this every year or it weakens the plants. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. A good bee plant[24]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. Helps to reduce the incidence of scab when it is grown under apple trees[201]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually free and easy, pot up the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle easily and plant out in the following spring. Division can be carried out at almost any time of the year but is probably best done in spring. The clumps should be divided at least every 3 or 4 years in order to maintain vigour[200], the divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",
