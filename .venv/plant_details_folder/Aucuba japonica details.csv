The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils.

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Leaves - cooked. An emergency food[177]. It would have to be quite an emergency to convince me to eat them[K].
20,Medicinal Uses,"Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PoulticeThe leaves are pounded and applied to burns, swellings, chilblains etc[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges."
23,Other Uses Description,"Makes a good hedge but its large leaves mean that it is quite labour intensive to maintain if a neatly clipped appearance is desired[29]. Unless you are happy with the large leaves being cut in half, it means that you have to trim the hedge with secateurs[29]. The plant will eventually make large weed-excluding shrubs and are suitable for covering large areas of ground, there are some dwarf forms that can be grown for ground cover[208]. 'Nana Rotundifolia' has been mentioned and will form a hummock of growth about 1 metre across[208]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. A very tolerant and easily grown plant[1], it thrives in most soils and even in the total shade of trees[11, 182, 200] though for good fruit production a position with at least moderate sun should be chosen[11]. Tolerates dry soils and drought[184, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates salt winds[200]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[11]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184, 200]. Often grown in the ornamental garden, there are many named varieties[182]. The foliage can be scorched in very long hot summers if the plant is in an open position[200]. Very tolerant of pruning, plants can be cut right back into the old wood if required[184, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[134]. Wash off the pulpy coating since this can inhibit germination. Stored seed should be soaked overnight and then stratified for 1 - 2 weeks at 3°c[134]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months or more at 20°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once they are 20cm or more tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long outdoors at any time between September to February though October and November are best[78]. Very easy, even small branches will root[1]. Layering in autumn. Takes 12 months[78]."
