The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Thelycrania iberica.

These uses are listed below. Fruit - raw or cooked[105]. A bitter flavour, it can also have an emetic effect on the body[1, 7, 11]. It is not worthwhile[115]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200]. An oil is obtained from the seed[2], it is edible when refined[75].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

These uses are listed below. The seed contains 45% of a non-drying oil[74], it is used in soap making and lighting[7, 13, 100, 115, 177]. A non-drying oil is also obtained from the pericarp, it is used for lighting[74]. The pericarp contains 19 - 35% oil[74]. A greenish-blue dye is obtained from the fruit[13, 74]. The young stems are very flexible and are used in basketry[7, 13, 74, 100].  - tough, hard. Used for small items such as tool handles, turnery etc[11, 61, 115]. A good quality charcoal is obtained from the wood[115], the wood also makes an excellent fuel[115].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame[188]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
