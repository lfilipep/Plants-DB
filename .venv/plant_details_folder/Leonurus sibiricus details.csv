Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Cardiac  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Emmenagogue  Hypnotic  Nervine  Oxytoxic  Stimulant  Stomachic  TonicChinese motherwort is unusual amongst Chinese herbs in that it is often prescribed for use on its own and not in a mixture with other plants[238]. The whole plant is antibacterial, antispasmodic, astringent, cardiac, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, hypnotic, nervine, oxytocic, stomachic, tonic, uterine stimulant[4, 9, 21, 46, 165, 174, 178, 192, 279]. The seeds have a similar action to the plant, but are a less effective diuretic and depurative[238]. The plant is used in the treatment of painful and excessive menstruation, post-partum bleeding, oedema, kidney complaints, kidney stones, eczema and abscesses[238, 240]. A tincture is used in the treatment of rheumatic fever[192]. The plant stimulates uterine contractions and should not therefore be used when in the earlier stages of pregnancy[240]. The plant is harvested when in flower but before the seeds have set, and is dried for later use[238]. The plant contains about 0.05% of an alkaloid called leonurine[240]. This has a curare-like effect on the motor-endings of the nervous system, acting in small doses as a stimulant to the respiratory system but in large doses causing respiratory paralysis[240].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.",Yields an essential oil[46].
