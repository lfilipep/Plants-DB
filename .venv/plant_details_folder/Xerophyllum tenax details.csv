If left undisturbed, plants can form quite large colonies, spreading by means of their tough rhizomes[200]. Plants do not flower every year, there are often gaps of 5 - 7 years between flowering[212].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if possible, otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.
