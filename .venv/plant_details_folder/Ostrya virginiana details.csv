The germination rate is variable but usually good[78].

Stored seed requires stratification, 3 months warm then 5 months cold usually works well but germination can take 18 months[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
