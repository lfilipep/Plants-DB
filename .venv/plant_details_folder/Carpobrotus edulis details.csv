It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw, cooked, dried for later use or made into pickles, chutney etc[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 183]. There is very little flesh in the fruit and it must be fully ripe otherwise it is very astringent[K]. Mucilaginous and sweetly acid[183]. Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 173]. Succulent, they are eaten in salads and can also be used as a substitute for pickled cucumber[183]. We find them too mucilaginous to be enjoyable[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Used as a traditional medicinal plant (GRIN, 2008), some anti-cancer properties have been shown by methanolic extracts of C. edulis (Ordway et al., 2003); and also anti-bacterial properties (van de Watt and Pretorius, 2001)[1d]."
22,Other Uses,"Fire retardant: Plants that do not easily burn and can be used in barrier plantings to limit the spread of forest fires.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Used in maritime areas to prevent soil erosion in sandy soils[188, 200]. Plants form a dense carpet and make an effective ground cover[208]. Can be grown as a fire barrier in areas subject to forest fires, it is moderately fire retardant[200]. The dried leaves contain about 19.4% tannin and the dry stems 14.2%[223]. Yields of 1700 kilos per hectare of cultivated plants have been achieved[223]. A popular plant for growth as an ornamental or for ground cover [1d]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained sandy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Plants can be grown on dry walls or in the flower border[166]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Very resistant to wind and salt spray[166]. Moderately fire-retardant[200]. Plants are not very frost resistant and can be killed by temperatures below about -2°c. They have naturalized themselves on cliffs along the coast of S. Britain but do not succeed inland unless grown in a sunny sheltered position[200]. A vigorous prostrate plant, rooting as it spreads. The flowers only open in the afternoon[200]. Grows on shallow soil [1d]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow March to June in a greenhouse. Lower night-time temperatures are beneficial. The seed usually germinates in 7 - 10 days at 23°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings at any time during the growing season. Allow the cutting to dry in the sun for a day or two then pot up in a very sandy mix. Very easy[K]."
