24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any sandy soil[1]. Requires a gritty well-drained soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds on a wall[188]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[200] so long as they are in a well-drained soil. They strongly dislike winter wet[200]. Individual offsets take several years to reach flowering size but then die after flowering, though more offsets are produced[188, 200]. This species does not hybridize naturally[1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest surface sowing the seed in a sunny position in a greenhouse in late winter or early spring. Do not allow the compost to become dry. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of offsets in the summer[200].",
