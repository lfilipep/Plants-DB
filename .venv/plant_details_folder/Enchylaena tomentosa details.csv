0,Enchylaena tomentosa,Ruby Saltbush,Chenopodiaceae,8-11,"The leaves are rich in oxalic acid. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since oxalic acid can bind up the body's supply of calcium leading to nutritional deficiency. It is oxalic acid that gives foods such as rhubarb their acid flavour. Cooking the leaves will greatly reduce the oxalic acid content. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Loamy and slightly saline soils by the coast in semi-arid areas[154, 157]. Found in salt marshes and rocky headlands as well as in arid zones inland[193].",Australia.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/EnchylaenaTomentosa.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Enchylaena tomentosa is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,"Fruit - crisp, sweet and succulent[144, 183]. A salty-sweet flavour[193]. Very small, it is about 5mm in diameter[193]. The fruits can be soaked in water and the liquid drunk like sweetened tea[193]. Leaves - cooked like spinach[183, 193]. The leaves are rich in oxalates so they should not be eaten in quantity[144].",Antiscorbutic: A plant rich in vitamin C that is used to counteract scurvy.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AntiscorbuticThe plant is antiscorbutic[144].,,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. It tolerates temperatures down to at least -7c in Australian gardens where it also resists salt spray[157]. However, this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. It might be worthwhile trying it as a summer annual and seeing if it can overwinter. It probably requires a very well-drained soil and a sunny position[K]. We have overwintered the plant in a cold greenhouse, though it suffered lots of die-back, so it will obviously have problems outdoors[K].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out after the last expected frosts. Give some protection for at least their first winter outdoors. It might also be possible to grow the plant as a summer annual, sowing in the spring and planting out the young plants after the last expected frosts.
