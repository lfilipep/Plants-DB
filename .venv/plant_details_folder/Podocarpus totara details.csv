23,Other Uses Description,"- straight grained, reddish, very durable lasting a long time in water, but it can be brittle. Used for construction work and cabinet making[1, 11, 46, 61, 128].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich moist non-alkaline soil[167]. This species is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain. Plants have succeeded in Suffolk and Argyll as well as in southern and western Britain but it is only in Cornwall and Ireland that plants achieve the stature of trees[81, 185]. A tree at Trebah gardens in Cornwall was 16 metres tall in 1959[185]. Plants are fairly slow growing with an average increase in height around 20cm a year in Cornwall[185]. Cultivated as a timber tree in New Zealand[1]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed can be sown at any time of the year in a sandy soil in a warm greenhouse, though it is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame[78].",
