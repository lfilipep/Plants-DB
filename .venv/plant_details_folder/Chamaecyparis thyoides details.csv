Succeeds in most soils and situations, but prefers abundant moisture and a deep loamy soil and a sheltered position[1, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Survives on dry alkaline soils[200]. Growth of trees is hardly affected by a lack of phosphate in the soil. Plants are moderately shade tolerant, especially when young[81, 200]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution according to one report[200], whilst another says that they do not do well in a polluted atmosphere[1]. This species is especially well adapted for planting in cold wet places[1]. Plants are hardy to about -35°c[200]. A long-lived tree in the wild with specimens more than 1,000 years old[229]. It is slow growing in cultivation[200], trees rarely grow more than 20cm in a year[185]. The branches become brittle with age[1]. A very polymorphic species, there are many named varieties[200]. The crushed foliage has a rather gingery hot aroma[185]. Favoured by many birds for roosting, high cover and especially for nesting, large specimens of this tree help to attract songbirds to the garden[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Wetlands plant, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a seedbed outdoors[78]. The seed is best sown in pots in a frame[K]. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. One month warm then one month cold stratification has produced good results[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in late summer or autumn in sandy soil in a cold frame[1, 11, 200]. Difficult, it may be best done in late winter to early spring[113]."
