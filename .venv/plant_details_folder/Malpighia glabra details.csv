24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the subtropics to hot, tropical, lowland areas with medium to high rainfall[303 , 335 ]. It can be found at elevations up to 1,700 metres, but does best below 800 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 5 - 34°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,300 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 2,400mm[418 ]. Tolerates seasonally dry periods[335 ]. Easily grown in a good soil and a sunny position[296 ]. Prefers a rich, deep and well drained soil but is able to tolerate a variety of soil conditions[303 , 335 ]. Sandy soils carry an increasing risk of nematode infection[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 5 - 8[418 ]. Requires a pH in excess of 5.5[303 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[307 ]. Plants are fairly tolerant of salt-laden winds[307 ]. Seedlings can fruit when only 2 - 3 years old, but are not always of as good quality as their parents[296 ]. Trees start to produce well 3 - 4 years after planting and continue for 15 years[303 ]. Plants can produce several flushes of flowers each year[307 ]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[307 ]. Plants can produce 2 - 3 crops of fruit a year[296 ]. Individual trees can produce 15 - 30 kilos of fruit each year[303 ]. Yields of 6.7 - 105 tonnes per hectare have been recorded[418 ]. Plants usually require cross-pollination to ensure a good fruit set[335 ], though there are some reports of self-fertilization[303 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: Rose/Mauve. Spacing: 15-20 ft. (4.7-6 m)."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - germination is slow, with only 5 - 50% of the seed germinating[303 ]. Cuttings Layering Grafting"
