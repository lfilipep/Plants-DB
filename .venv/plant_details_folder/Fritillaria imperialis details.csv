It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Emollient  Galactogogue  ResolventThe bulb is diuretic, emollient and resolvent[240]. It is also a cardiac poison[240]. It has been used as an expectorant and also to encourage increased breast milk production[254]. The fresh plant contains the toxic alkaloid 'imperialine'[240].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a moderately fertile soil[90]. Prefers a heavy soil without any disturbance, not even hoeing[1, 42]. Requires a well-drained soil and a sunny position[42, 90, 200] or the shade of deciduous trees or shrubs[90]. Succeeds in drier soils and is drought tolerant once established[190]. Plants succeed in most fertile soils, avoiding pure chalk, heavy clay and boggy sites[233]. The dormant bulbs are very hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -10°c[214]. A very ornamental plant, there are some named varieties[233]. The flowers smell of wet fur and garlic[245]. Bulbs should be planted 10 - 12 cm deep in July[1] on their side with sharp sand beneath them to ensure that they do not rot[42, 200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage.","Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[1]. Protect from frost[134]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible and can take a year or more to germinate[134]. Sow the seed quite thinly to avoid the need to prick out the seedlings. Once they have germinated, give them an occasional liquid feed to ensure that they do not suffer mineral deficiency. Once they die down at the end of their second growing season, divide up the small bulbs, planting 2 - 3 to an 8cm deep pot. Grow them on for at least another year in light shade in the greenhouse before planting them out whilst dormant. Division of offsets in August[1]. The larger bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out in the autumn.
