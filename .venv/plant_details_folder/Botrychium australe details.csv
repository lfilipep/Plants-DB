4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]."
5,Habitats,"Lowland to montane forest, usually along the edges of clearings[173]. Also found in grassland[44]. North, South and Chatham Islands."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sandy loam with just a small portion of peat[1]. Requires sharp drainage[1]. Best grown in an open position[1]. Plants can be difficult to establish. The prothalli (small plants formed when the spores germinate) of this plant form a symbiotic relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus, similar to the association of orchid seedlings with an invading fungus[200]. A very ornamental plant, it is said to require greenhouse protection in Britain[1] but might survive outdoors in the mildest areas of the country. Some botanists consider this species to be no more than a part of B. ternatum[1]. Unlike most species of ferns, the fronds of this species grow up straight and not curled inward, crozier fashion[4]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,Spores - best surface sown as soon as they are ripe in a greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out. Placing the pot in a plastic bag helps to maintain a humid atmosphere which promotes germination and growth. Prick out small clumps into pots when they are large enough to handle and keep moist until established. Grow on in a greenhouse for at least the first winter and plant out in late spring. Division. It is best not to try and disturb this plant[200].
