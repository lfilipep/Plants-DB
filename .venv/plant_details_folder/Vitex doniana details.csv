13,Summary,"Vitex doniana, or commonly known as Black Plum, is a deciduous flowering tree growing up to 20 m in height in tropical Africa. It has a heavy rounded crown. The clear trunk can be up to 1m across and is covered with pale brown or gray white bark that has long cracks sticky ridges. The leathery and shiny leaves are opposite and arranged like the fingers on a hand with five leaflets. The creamy with one hairy violet lobe flowers are fragrant and occur in clusters of up to 20 on a long stalk. The fruit is smooth and oblong, green marked with white dots, and turn black when ripe. The fruits can be eaten raw or cooked, or made into a jam or wine. A syrup can be made from the pulp of the fruit which can be used as a nutritive sweeten. Young twigs and leaves are consumed as a vegetable. Leaves can be pounded and added to warm filtered grain beer and then drunk. It can also be used as a substitute for tea. The seeds, on the other hand, are roasted and used to make a coffee-like drink. Black plum is used in traditional medicine for dysentery, diarrhea, anemia, jaundice, leprosy, gonorrhea, ankylostomiasis, rickets, fevers, respiratory diseases, headache, stiffness, measles, rash, chickenpox, hemiplegia, conjunctivitis, wounds, burns, colic, leprosy, etc. Dried fruits, young leaves, and bark produce an ink. The twigs are used s chewing stick for teeth cleaning. Dried seeds yield oil which can be used for skin cream, resin, and paint production. The wood is used for light building material, furniture, carvings, and boats. It also makes a good fuel and charcoal.",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antidiarrhoeal  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Galactogogue  Hypotensive  Leprosy  Odontalgic  Ophthalmic  Skin  TonicThe plant is often used in traditional medicine. Modern research has shown that the plant has a range of actions upon the body. Consumption of large amounts of the fruits has been shown to cause a transient reduction in reproductive functioning in female olive baboons. The presence of progestogen-like compounds in the fruit has been suggested as the probable cause[299 ]. An aqueous extract of the stem bark has been shown to produce a dose-dependant hypotensive effect and to also be hepato-protective[299 ]. Stem bark extracts can inhibit the growth of clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli, suggesting that they may be valuable in the treatment of dysentery and other gastroenteritic infections[299 ]. The fruit is used to improve fertility and to treat anaemia, jaundice, leprosy and dysentery[303 ]. Both the dried and the fresh fruits are eaten as a treatment against diarrhoea[299 ] The root is anodyne[299 ]. A decoction is used to treat gonorrhoea, ankylostomiasis, rickets, gastro-intestinal disorders and jaundice[299 , 303 ]. A decoction of the root is drunk by women to treat backaches[303 ]. The leaves are anodyne, febrifuge, galactagogue and tonic[299 ]. A decoction is taken internally as a tonic and to treat fevers and respiratory diseases[299 ]. It is applied externally to increase milk flow and as a treatment for headache, stiffness, measles, rash, fever, chickenpox and hemiplegia[299 ]. The young tender leaves are pounded and the juice squeezed into the eyes to treat conjunctivitis and other eye troubles[299 , 303 ]. A paste made from the pounded leaves and bark is applied to wounds and burns[299 ]. The powdered bark is added to water and then taken to treat colic[299 ]. A bark extract is used to treat stomach complaints, kidney troubles, leprosy, liver diseases, and to control bleeding after childbirth[299 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Friction sticks: Used for starting fires when there are no matches.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Ink: Plants that can be used as an ink.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The heavy rounded crown provides good shade[303 ]. The tree has nitrogen-fixing roots and this, combined with the leaf fall, contributes to the improvement of soil fertility[299 , 303 ]. The leaves can be used for mulch[303 ]. The tree has some potential for use as a pioneer species - in Central Africa it is often the first species to establish when gallery forests evolve in low-lying areas in the savannah[299 ]. Other Uses An ink is produced from the dried fruits, young leaves and bark[317 ]. The blackish extract obtained by boiling the leaves, bark, roots and/or fruits is used as ink and as a dye for clothes[299 , 303 ]. The twigs are used as chewing sticks for teeth cleaning[299 ]. An aqueous extract of the chewing sticks has been shown to exhibit strong activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria including medically and dentally relevant bacteria, although the extracts of chewing sticks from Garcinia kola and Anogeissus leiocarpa had broader and generally stronger effects. This supports the traditional use of these chewing sticks with reported anticaries effect[299 ]. The dried seeds yield about 30% oil[299 ]. The oil has high iodine and low saponification values and can be used for skin cream, resin and paint production[299 ]. The wood is said to be used as friction sticks to start a fire[323 ]. The heartwood is creamy white to pale brown, yellowish brown or greyish brown; it is indistinctly demarcated from the 25 - 60mm wide sapwood[299 ]. The grain is straight to wavy or interlocked; texture moderately fine to moderately coarse. The wood resembles teak; it is medium-weight and soft; usually not durable, although good durability has also been reported, especially resistance against termites[299 , 303 ]. It is easy to saw and work with hand and machine tools; it often planes to a silky or furry surface due to the presence of interlocked grain; it nails well with little splitting, but it does not always hold nails well. Veneer of good quality can be produced, but the logs are often too irregular to be suitable for rotary peeling. The wood is often too soft for turnery[299 ]. It is suitable for light building material, furniture, carvings and boats[303 ]. The wood makes a good fuel and is also used to make charcoal[303 , 323 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Black plum is a plant of hot, tropical climates where it is found at elevations from near sea level to 1,850 metres[303 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 14 - 28°c, but can tolerate 10 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 750 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 600 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Occurs on a variety of well-drained soils of varying origins, usually alluvial soils[303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. The growth rate is moderate. In plantations in northern Cote d'Ivoire, seedlings were on average 70 - 90cm tall after 3 years, the tallest ones reaching 170cm[299 ]. On good soils in southern Burkina Faso early growth is a bit faster[299 ]. Trees respond well to coppicing and also produce root suckers[303 , 323 ]. The fruit falls from the trees when it is ripe. It is not damaged by this fall so people generally harvest from under the tree rather than picking it from the tree[323 ]. The flowers are extremely attractive to bees[323 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - The seed has a hard coat, which slows down germination. Any pre-treatment would be to soften or abrade this seed coat and allow the ingress of water[303 ]. This can either be done by soaking the seed in hot water that is allowed to cool - if the seed has not shown signs of swelling within 12 - 24 hours then remove from the water and abrade the seedcoat, being careful not to damage the seed below[K ]. It is thought forest fires help in inducing germination because they help break the hard seedcoat[303 ]. The treated seed is said to germinate easily - it can be raised in a nursery and transplanted, or can be sown in situ[323 ]. Root suckers[323 ]. Cuttings[323 ].",
