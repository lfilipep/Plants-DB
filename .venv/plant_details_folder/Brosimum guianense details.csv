It is most commonly found in secondary forests, and sometimes in very dry or very humid terrains[ 420 ].","S.

It has a straight, cylindrical bole and a dense, elongate crown. It is used medicinally as treatment for asthma and cold, as an analgesic (softened bark), and anthelmintic, bitter, and caustic (latex). The bark is a source of white latex that is thick and sticky. Bastard breadnut is widely exploited in the wild for its highly valued timber. The wood is extremely hard and heavy, strong, durable, and resistant to termites. The fruit pulp of this tree is consumed raw.","Brosimum guianense is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Alicastrum guianense (Aubl.) Kuntze Brosimum aubletii Poepp. & Endl. Brosimum discolor Schott Brosim,,Fruit: ,,Edible portion: Fruit. The fruit pulp is eaten raw.,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Anthelmintic  Antiasthmatic  BitterThe macerated bark is warmed and used as an analgesic[ 348 ]. The latex is anthelmintic, bitter and caustic[ 348 ]. It is mixed with dairy milk and then drunk as a remedy for internal ulcers. It is drunk as a treatment for asthma and colds[ 348 ].","Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other uses rating: Very High (5/5). Other Uses: A thick, sticky, white latex is obtained from the bark[ 378 ]. The plant is exploited from the wild for its wood, which is highly sought after for specialist uses. It is one of the most expensive of woods, often sold by weight[46]. The tree is slow in forming heartwood, which is the only part used commercially. A tree of 35cm diameter may, on occasions, have only 2 - 10cm of heartwood, while a 50cm tree will ordinarily have not more than 18cm. The amount of heartwood is reported to vary according to location. Certain areas produce timber with considerable heartwood, while in other areas even large trees may not be worth felling[ 378 ] The heartwood is dark red to reddish-brown or brown, with black markings that resemble letters or hieroglyphs - the distinctiveness of these markings is reduced as the colour of the backgrounds is darkened by exposure; it is not clearly demarcated from the light, yellow to nearly white sapwood[ 46 , 378 ]. The texture is medium; the grain is straight; lustre medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is extremely hard, extremely heavy, strong, very durable, resistant to dry wood termites[ 378 ]. Because of its hardness, the wood is worked with considerable difficulty, being difficult to cut and taking nails poorly, however, it finishes smoothly and takes a beautiful polish[ 46 , 378 , 420 ]. Because of the limited supply, small size, and high cost, the wood is best suited for speciality items that capitalize on its unusual beauty, hardness, and density. It is therefore mainly used for purposes such as inlay work, furniture, drum sticks, umbrella handles, fishing rods, fancy articles, violin bows, cabinetwork etc[ 46 , 378 , 420 ].",,"A plant of the lowland tropics, where it is found in dry to very humid regions[ 420 ]. Succeeds in a sunny to semi-shaded position. Plants are at least somewhat drought resistant[ 420 ]. Young plants normally establish well and grow away quickly[ 420 ]. Plants flower and fruit throughout the year. A monoecious species, but male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed is required.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual pots or a nursery bed in a sunny position[ 420 ]. Germination rates are usually above 50%, with sprouting occurring in a few weeks[ 420 ]. Plants grow away quickly.
