It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil.

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil that is not too dry[187]. Tolerates poor soils[233]. Succeeds in most soils and is tolerant of quite deep shade[219]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190], they grow well in dry soils and can be grown in crevices on walls[219]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. This species has pink to red flowers[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Polymorphic, intergrading with S. caucasicum where their ranges meet. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Cuttings can be taken at almost any time in the growing season, though early in the season is probably best."
