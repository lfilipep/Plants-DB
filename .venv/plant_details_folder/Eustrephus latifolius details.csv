Succeeds in heavy shade in Australian gardens, requiring shade in most soil types[157]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it can succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[1]. It tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. Plants require support by tying[157].",Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.
