The seed is aromatic, carminative, mildly diuretic, galactogogue, stimulant and stomachic[4, 21, 46, 165]. It is also used in the form of an extracted essential oil[243]. Used either in an infusion, or by eating the seed whole, the essential oil in the seed relieves intestinal spasms and griping, helping to settle colic[254]. Chewing the seed improves bad breath[254]. Dill is also a useful addition to cough, cold and flu remedies, it can be used with antispasmodics such as Viburnum opulus to relieve period pains[254].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container. An easily grown plant[4], it prefers a moderately rich loose soil and full sun[14, 27, 88]. Requires a well-drained soil[27] and shelter from the wind[200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.3 to 7.8. Dill is a commonly cultivated herb, especially in warm temperate and tropical zones. It is grown mainly for its edible leaves and seeds, though it is also used medicinally. There are many named varieties[142, 183]. 'Bouquet' is an American cultivar that has a prolific production of seeds[238]. The sub-species A. graveolens sowa from India has a slightly different flavour to the type species[238]. The plant quickly runs to seed in dry weather[200]. It often self-sows when growing in a suitable position[37, 88]. A good companion for corn and cabbages, also in moderation for cucumbers, lettuce and onions, but it inhibits the growth of carrots[14, 18, 20]. Dill reduces a carrot crop if it is grown to maturity near them[201]. However, the young plant will help to deter carrot root fly[201]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[14, 18, 20]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April to early summer in situ and only just cover[200, 238]. The seed germinates in 2 weeks if the soil is warm. A regular supply of leaves can be obtained if successional sowings are made from May to the end of June[89, 200]. Autumn sowings can succeed if the winters are mild[4]. Dill is very intolerant of root disturbance and should not be transplanted because it will then quickly run to seed.",
