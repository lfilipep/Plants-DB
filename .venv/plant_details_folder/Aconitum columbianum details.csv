0,Aconitum columbianum,Columbian monkshood,Ranunculaceae,Coming soon,The whole plant is highly toxic - simple skin contact has caused numbness in some people. The roots and seeds are the most toxic and also the leaves just before the plant flowers[212]. Available information suggests that Aconitum columbianum is probably not one of the extremely toxic aconites[270].,"Moist woods to sub-alpine meadows, mostly along streams[60]. Spring-fed bogs, seep areas, meadows, along streams, and in other wet areas at elevations of 300 - 3500 metres[270].",North-western N. America - Alaska to California.,(0 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AconitumColumbianum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AconitumColumbianum2.jpg",,"Aconitum columbianum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in).  It is in flower from July to August. The flowers are pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade;,None known,"Nervine: Stimulates and calms the nerves.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Nervine  Parasiticide  SedativeThe drug 'aconite' can be obtained from the root of this plant[212]. It is used as a heart and nerve sedative[212]. This is a very poisonous plant and should only be used with extreme caution and under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,The seed is used as a parasiticide[172].,,"Thrives in most soils and in the light shade of trees[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a moist soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Prefers a calcareous soil. Grows well in open woodlands[1, 4]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits and deer[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby species, especially legumes[54]. Closely related to A. fischeri and part of that species according to some botanists[1]. A very variable plant, there is also a sub-species (A. columbianum viviparum) that produces bulbils in the leaf axils[270].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[111]. The seed can be stratified and sown in spring but will then be slow to germinate[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division - best done in spring but it can also be done in autumn[1, 111]. Another report says that division is best carried out in the autumn or late winter because the plants come into growth very early in the year[233]. One to several small daughter tubers are produced at the first few nodes above the parent tuber, usually below ground, in a small percentage of the plants in bulbiferous and nonbulbiferous populations[270]. These can be removed and potted up to produce new plants[K]. Bulbils are produced in the leaf axils of sub-species viviparum[270]. These are an effective means of vegetative reproduction. They fall to the ground late in the season and sprout vigorously, giving rise to new plants[270].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
