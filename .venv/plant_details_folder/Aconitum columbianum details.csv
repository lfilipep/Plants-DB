3,USDA hardiness,Coming soon,
4,Known Hazards,The whole plant is highly toxic - simple skin contact has caused numbness in some people. The roots and seeds are the most toxic and also the leaves just before the plant flowers[212]. Available information suggests that Aconitum columbianum is probably not one of the extremely toxic aconites[270].,
5,Habitats,"Moist woods to sub-alpine meadows, mostly along streams[60]. Spring-fed bogs, seep areas, meadows, along streams, and in other wet areas at elevations of 300 - 3500 metres[270].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in most soils and in the light shade of trees[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a moist soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Prefers a calcareous soil. Grows well in open woodlands[1, 4]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits and deer[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby species, especially legumes[54]. Closely related to A. fischeri and part of that species according to some botanists[1]. A very variable plant, there is also a sub-species (A. columbianum viviparum) that produces bulbils in the leaf axils[270].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[111]. The seed can be stratified and sown in spring but will then be slow to germinate[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division - best done in spring but it can also be done in autumn[1, 111]. Another report says that division is best carried out in the autumn or late winter because the plants come into growth very early in the year[233]. One to several small daughter tubers are produced at the first few nodes above the parent tuber, usually below ground, in a small percentage of the plants in bulbiferous and nonbulbiferous populations[270]. These can be removed and potted up to produce new plants[K]. Bulbils are produced in the leaf axils of sub-species viviparum[270]. These are an effective means of vegetative reproduction. They fall to the ground late in the season and sprout vigorously, giving rise to new plants[270].",
