24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any fertile soil in sun or part shade[182, 200]. Plants grow best on a shady wall or when grown into a tree[200]. They succeed in sun or deep shade, but fruits are much more likely to be produced when the plants are grown in a sunny position[200, 219]. Plants are not fully hardy in Britain, they tolerate temperatures down to about -15°c[184] and can be damaged by prolonged periods below -5°c[200]. Plants are hardy at Kew but they do not fruit freely in this country[11]. Hand pollination would probably help[11, 166], the fruits are also more likely to form in hot summers[166]. There is also some doubt as to whether the plants are monoecious or dioecious, it would be best to grow at least two distinct plants (not cuttings from one plant) and make sure that male and female flowers are present[K]. The flowers are sweetly and heavily scented. The males are produced on the previous years wood whilst females are produced on the current years wood[182]. Plants are fast growing[200] and climb by means of twining[182]. This genus is closely related to Stauntonia species[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details on this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise as soon as you obtain it, in a warm greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of softwood[1]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood in late summer or autumn[188].
