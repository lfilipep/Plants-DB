13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Carya glabra is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf from June to October, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"d - raw or cooked[61, 101, 161]. Very variable in quality, some are sweet and pleasant whilst others are bitter and astringent[1, 2, 11, 46, 63, 183]. In general it is inferior to other hickories[117, 159]. The nut is rather small[K], has a very thick shell and contains very little edible matter[82, 226]. The seed ripens in late autumn and, when stored in its shell in a cool place, will keep for at least 6 months[K]. Sap - tapped in spring and used as a refreshing drink. Sweet[101].",

22,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"- hard, strong, tough, very flexible. It weighs 51lb per cubic foot[235]. An excellent timber, it is used for tool handles, agricultural implements etc[46, 61, 82]. A very good fuel, burning well and giving off a lot of heat[46, 61, 82].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible. Prefers a deep moisture-retentive loam in a sunny sheltered position, requiring a good summer for best development[1, 63, 137, 200]. Succeeds in drier soils than most members of this genus[200]. Slow growing[200]. Sometimes cultivated for its edible seed, there are some named varieties[63]. Trees take 25 - 30 years before they commence bearing seeds and peak production does not begin until they are about 80 years old[229]. Trees thrive in Britain, often bearing fruit[11]. Trees are planted for timber in Germany[50]. Plants are strongly tap-rooted and should be planted in their permanent positions as soon as possible[1, 137]. Sowing in situ would be the best method so long as the seed could be protected from mice[1, 200]. Trees are late coming into leaf (usually late May to June) and lose their leaves early in the autumn (usually in October)[137]. During this time they cast a heavy shade. These factors combine to make the trees eminently suitable for a mixed woodland planting with shrubs and other trees beneath them[137]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Most species in this genus have quite a wide range of distribution and, in order to find trees more suited to this country, seed from the most appropriate provenances should be sought[137]. Most trees growing in Britain at present tend to only produce good seed after hot summers[137]. Trees are self-fertile but larger crops of better quality seeds are produced if cross-pollination takes place[229].  Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires a period of cold stratification - seed given 3 months cold stratification had a 91% germination rate[113]. Best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[78]. Stored seed should be kept moist (but not wet) prior to sowing and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as possible[78]. Where possible, sow 1 or 2 seeds only in each deep pot and thin to the best seedling. If you need to transplant the seedlings, then do this as soon as they are large enough to handle, once more using deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Put the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in their first summer, and give some protection from the cold for at least the first winter. Seed can also be sown in situ so long as protection is given from mice etc and the seed is given some protection from cold[200] (a plastic bottle with the top and bottom removed and a wire mesh top fitted to keep the mice out is ideal)",
