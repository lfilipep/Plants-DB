Prefers a sheltered position in full sun in a moderately fertile well-drained soil enriched with leafmould[200, 260]. Plants are scarcely hardy at Kew but they succeed outdoors in the milder parts of the country[11], tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[260]. Growth can be restricted by cutting the plant back in spring[188].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a warm greenhouse in late winter or early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200]. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn in a frame[200]. Basal cuttings are used[200]. Layering.",
