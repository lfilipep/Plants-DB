18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 5, 9, 12, 24]. Usually available from late January[K]. One report says that they have an overpowering garlic odour that dissipates on cooking[183], though our experience is that they are considerably milder than garlic[K]. The leaves make a very nice addition to salads, and are especially welcome as a vital and fresh green leaf in the middle of winter[K]. Flowers - raw or cooked. These are somewhat stronger than the leaves, in small quantities they make a decorative and very tasty addition to salads[K]. The flowering heads can still be eaten as the seed pods are forming, though the flavour gets even stronger as the seeds ripen[K]. Bulb - raw or cooked[2]. A fairly strong garlic flavour, though it is quite small and fiddly to harvest[K]. The bulbs can be harvested at any time the plant is dormant from early summer to early winter. Harvested in early summer, they will store for at least 6 months[K]. The bulbs can be up to 4cm long and 1cm in diameter[00]. The small green bulbils are used as a caper substitute[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health.

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiasthmatic  Anticholesterolemic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Cholagogue  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Disinfectant  Diuretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Hypotensive  Rubefacient  Stimulant  Stomachic  Tonic  VasodilatorRamsons has most of the health benefits of the cultivated garlic, A. sativum[7, 238], though it is weaker in action[254]. It is therefore a very beneficial addition to the diet, promoting the general health of the body when used regularly. It is particularly effective in reducing high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels[9]. It is recognised as having a good effect on fermentative dyspepsia[244]. All parts of the plant can be used, but the bulb is most active. The plant is anthelmintic, antiasthmatic, anticholesterolemic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, cholagogue, depuritive, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, hypotensive, rubefacient, stimulant, stomachic, tonic and vasodilator[7, 21]. Ramsons ease stomach pain and are tonic to the digestion, so they can be used in the treatment of diarrhoea, colic, wind, indigestion and loss of appetite[254]. The whole herb can be used in an infusion against threadworms, either ingested or given as an enema[254]. The herb is also beneficial in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis and emphysema[254]. The juice is used as an aid to weight loss and can also be applied externally to rheumatic and arthritic joints where its mild irritant action and stimulation to the local circulation can be of benefit[254]."
22,Other Uses,"Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20]. The juice of the plant has been used as a general household disinfectant[7].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers woodland conditions in a moist well-drained soil[203]. Plants are often found in the wild growing in quite wet situations[K]. When growing in suitable conditions, wild garlic forms a dense carpet of growth in the spring and can be a very invasive plant[24, 203, K]. It dies down in early summer, however, allowing other plants to grow in the same space[K]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. The seeds are dispersed by ants[244]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe either in situ or in a cold frame. It germinates quickly and can be grown on in the greenhouse for the first year, planting out the dormant bulbs in the late summer of the following year. Stored seed can be sown in spring in a greenhouse. Division in summer after the plants have died down. Very easy, the divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
