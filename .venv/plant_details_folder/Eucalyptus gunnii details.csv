4,Known Hazards,"Citronellal, an essential oil found in most Eucalyptus species is reported to be mutagenic when used in isolation[269]. In large doses, oil of eucalyptus, like so many essential oils has caused fatalities from intestinal irritation[269]. Death is reported from ingestion of 4 - 24 ml of essential oils, but recoveries are also reported for the same amount[269]. Symptoms include gastroenteric burning and irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, oxygen deficiency, ,weakness, dizziness, stupor, difficult respiration, delirium, paralysis, convulsions, and death, usually due to respiratory failure[269]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Eucalyptus gunnii is an evergreen Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink."
19,Edible Uses Description,"2, 77] (it is a stem exudate according to some reports[61, 177]) has a sweet taste. The sap is obtained by making wounds in the bark during spring[2]. A tapped trunk yields up to ½ litre a day[144]. Another report says that the sap exudes from the trunk and can be drunk directly or fermented into a cider[183]. This same report says that the plant also produces an edible manna[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AntisepticEucalyptus leaves are a traditional Aboriginal herbal remedy. The essential oil found in the leaves is a powerful antiseptic and is used all over the world for relieving coughs and colds, sore throats and other infections[254]. The essential oil is a common ingredient in many over-the-counter cold remedies[254]. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is antiseptic[152]. The essential oil obtained from various species of eucalyptus is a very powerful antiseptic, especially when it is old, because ozone is formed in it on exposure to air. It has a decided disinfectant action, destroying the lower forms of life[4]. The oil can be used externally, applied to cuts, skin infections etc, it can also be inhaled for treating blocked nasal passages, it can be gargled for sore throat and can also be taken internally for a wide range of complaints[4]. Some caution is advised, however, because like all essential oils, it can have a deleterious effect on the body in larger doses[4]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Fungicide: Arrests the growth of, or kills, fungi.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Leaves yield between 0.4 to 0.8% of an essential oil that contains antifungal substances[152, 154]. Coppiced for fuel. The wood must be dried for at least 12 months before use[107]. Trees can be planted in wet ground to dry it up and make it unsuitable for mosquitoes to breed in[50]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a moderately fertile well-drained moisture retentive circum-neutral soil[200]. Dislikes clay or chalk soils but succeeds in most other soils[98]. Tolerates poor soils[98], especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Dislikes shade[98]. Tolerates dry soils and also drought once it is established[200]. One of the hardiest Eucalyptus species[11], it is very frost resistant, tolerating long periods down to -14°c and short periods down to -18°c[107, 200]. Eucalyptus species have not adopted a deciduous habit and continue to grow until it is too cold for them to do so. This makes them more susceptible to damage from sudden cold snaps. If temperature fluctuations are more gradual, as in a woodland for example, the plants have the opportunity to stop growing and become dormant, thus making them more cold resistant[200]. A deep mulch around the roots to prevent the soil from freezing also helps the trees to survive cold conditions. The members of this genus are remarkably adaptable however, there can be a dramatic increase in the hardiness of subsequent generations from the seed of survivors growing in temperate zones[200]. A very ornamental tree, it is very fast growing when young and requires shelter from strong winds if it is not to become very wind-shaped[K]. Trees can tolerate salt-laden winds[200]. The plant has juvenile foliage which is quite different from the adult leaves[188]. The leaves, especially when bruised, are very aromatic[245]. Plants respond well to coppicing. Commonly planted in S.W. Europe as a timber tree and also for shelter, soil conservation and as an anti-malarial measure since it will dry out wet land that is suitable for mosquitoes to breed in[50]. Plants are shallow-rooting and, especially in windy areas, should be planted out into their permanent positions when small to ensure that they do not suffer from wind-rock[245]. They strongly resent root disturbance and should be container grown before planting out into their permanent position[11]. Eucalyptus monocultures are an environmental disaster, they are voracious, allelopathic and encourage the worst possible attitudes to land use and conservation[200]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are a good bee crop[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 10 through 8. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow February/March in a sunny position in a greenhouse[11, 78, 134]. Species that come from high altitudes appreciate 6 - 8 weeks cold stratification at 2°c[200]. Pot up the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the second set of seed leaves has developed, if left longer than this they might not move well. Plant out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold in their first winter. The seed can also be sown in June, the young trees being planted in their final positions in late spring of the following year. The seed has a long viability[200]."
