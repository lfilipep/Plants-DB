1,Common Name,"Broad Bean, Fava Bean"
2,Family,Fabaceae or Leguminosae
3,USDA hardiness,4-10
4,Known Hazards,"Although often used as an edible seed, there are reports that eating the seed of this plant can cause the disease 'Favism' in susceptible people[7, 76]. Inhaling the pollen can also cause the disease[7, 218]. Favism, which is a severe haemolytic anaemia due to an inherited enzymatic deficiency[218], only occurs in cases of excessive consumption of the raw seed (no more details are given[K]) and when the person is genetically inclined towards the disease[7, 213]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Vicia faba major is a ANNUAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Immature seed - raw or cooked. Broad bean seeds are very nutritious and are frequently used as items of food. The seeds can be eaten raw when they are small and tender, as they grow older they can be cooked as a vegetable[2, 7, 16, 132, 183]. They have a very pleasant floury taste[K].There are some potential problems to the use of these seeds if they are consumed in large quantities[7] - see the notes above on toxicity.Mature seeds can be eaten cooked as a vegetable or added to soups etc[2, 7, 16, 183]. They are best soaked for 12 - 24 hours prior to cooking in order to soften them and reduce the cooking time[K]. They will also become more nutritious this way[K]. The flavour is mild and pleasant with a floury texture[K]. They can also be dried and ground into a flour for use in making bread etc with cereal flours[183]. The seed can also be fermented to make tempeh'[183]. Made into a paste, they can be used as a sandwich filling[299]. The seed can be sprouted before being cooked[183]. Popped seeds can be salted and eaten as a snack or roasted like peanuts[183].Young pods - cooked and eaten as a vegetable[183]. They quickly become fibrous as they grow larger[183], and also develop a hairy coating inside the pods that can become unpleasant as the pods get larger[K].Young leaves - cooked. They are very nutritious and can be used like spinach[105, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DiureticThe seedpods are diuretic and lithontripic[7].
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps. Does not include the essential oils, dyes and oils that are also used in making soap."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:The stems and leaves are sometimes used as a green manure[299].Broad beans grow well with carrots, cauliflowers, beet, cucumber, cabbages, leeks, celeriac, corn and potatoes, but is inhibited by onions, garlic and shallots[18, 20].Other Uses: A fibre is obtained from the stems.The burnt stems are rich in potassium and can be used in making soap.The dried stems can be burnt as a fuel[299]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Broad beans originated in warm temperate areas and can be cultivated from the cold temperate zone to the subtropics, and also at higher elevations from 1,300 - 3,800 metres in the tropics. It may flower well in the lowland tropics, but usually does not produce pods[299]. The ideal temperature range in the growing season is between 18 - 27°c, at higher temperatures the flowers are often aborted[200]. The plant requires an annual rainfall of 700 - 1,000mm, of which more than 60% should occur during the growing period[299].Prefers a fairly heavy loam but succeeds in a sunny position in most soils that are well-drained[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes dry conditions according to some reports[87, 200], whilst another says that it is drought tolerant once established[132]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 to 7[200].There are two main forms of this species - small seeded forms that are more commonly grown for feeding livestock and as a green manure, and larger seeded forms that are usually grown for human food. Of the larger seeded forms there are two main types:-'Longpod' beans are the more hardy and can be sown in the autumn in cool temperate areas.'Windsor' beans, which are considered to be finer flavoured, are less tolerant of the cold and so are best sown in spring[132].Autumn sown varieties are more susceptible to 'chocolate spot' fungus, this problem can be alleviated by the addition of potash to the soil[87].Black fly can be a major problem. Autumn sown crops are less likely to be affected. Pinching out the soft tips of the plants, one they are tall enough and are beginning to flower, can reduce the problem since the blackfly always start on the soft shoots and then spread to the older stems.This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in succession from late winter until early summer. Germination should take place in about 7 - 10 days. The earlier sowings should be of suitably hardy varieties such as the 'Longpods' whilst later sowings can be of the tastier varieties such as the 'Windsors'. By making fresh sowings every 3 weeks you will have a continuous supply of fresh young seeds from early summer until early autumn. If you want to grow the beans to maturity then the seed needs to be sown by the middle of spring. You may need to protect the seed from the ravages of mice. Another sowing can be made in middle to late autumn. This has to be timed according to the area where the plants are being grown. The idea is that the plants will make some growth in the autumn and be perhaps 15 - 20cm tall by the time the colder part of winter sets in. As long as the winter is not too severe, the plants should stand well and will grow away rapidly in the spring to produce an earlier crop. The plants will also be less likely to be attacked by blackfly. Make sure you choose a suitably hardy variety for this sowing."
