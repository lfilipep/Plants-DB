24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Pediomelum argophyllum is native to the central belt of N. America, from southern Canada to Texas, and, as such, will be subject to a continental climate in much of its range with very hot summers and very cold winters. Species in this genus generally require well-drained soil in a sunny position, succeeding in most soils[1 , 200 ]. Plants are very intolerant of root disturbance, they are best planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small[200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early to mid spring in a greenhouse. Either sow the seed in individual pots or pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible in order to avoid root disturbance. Grow them on in the pots until planting out in their final positions. It is usually impossible to transplant this species without fatal damage to the root[200]. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. It is virtually impossible to divide this species successfully[200].
