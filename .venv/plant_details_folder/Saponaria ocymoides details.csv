1,Common Name,"Tumbling Ted. Rock Soapwort, Rock soapwort"
2,Family,Caryophyllaceae
3,USDA hardiness,2-7
4,Known Hazards,"The plant contains saponins[13]. Although toxic, these substances are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm. They are also broken down by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops."

20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.
23,Other Uses Description,All parts of the plant are rich in saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[169]. The saponins are extracted by simmering the plant in water. Plants can be dried for later use[169]. A gentle and effective cleaner[169]. Plants make a good carpeting ground cover when spaced about 60cm apart each way[208].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden. Requires a gritty well-drained sunny dry position on a wall or the edge of a border creeping over a path[187]. Grows well in sandy and dry soils[188, 190]. Prefers a moisture-retentive soil[200]. Prefers a lime-free soil[1]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Hardy to about -15°c[187]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best if given a short cold stratification. Sow autumn or late winter in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 4 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, it can be successfully done at any time in the growing season if the plants are kept moist until they are re-established. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
