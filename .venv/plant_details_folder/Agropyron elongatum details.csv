0,Agropyron elongatum,Tall Wheatgrass,Poaceae or Gramineae,5-9,None known,Saline meadows and along seashores where it can be subject to occasional inundation[269].,"Eastern Mediterranean region, from southern Europe to Asia Minor and the Crimea.",(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AgropyronElongatum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Agropyron elongatum is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1.8 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.","The plant establishes well on wet alkaline soils and is extensively used in reclaiming such areas. It has been reported to be promising even in the arid zone of South Australia where rainfall is 12.5 - 20 cm annually. The plant has also been recommended for reclaiming saline soils and it has also been shown how the species can be used in reclaiming red mud bauxite residues[269]. According to the phytomass files (Duke, 1981b), annual productivity ranges from 2 to 15 MT/ha, which phytomass could be converted to alcohol or methane[269].",,"A very tolerant plant, able to grow in a wide range of conditions. It succeeds in soils with a pH of 5.3 - 9.0, and thrives in areas subject to inundation by saline water, such as seashores and saline meadows as well as on alkaline soils[269]. The plant grows best in full sun but tolerates some shade. Tall wheatgrass is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 30 to 210cm and average temperatures ranging between 5° to 19°C[269]. Not all forms of the plant are frost-tolerant, but some forms will succeed even in Northern Canada[269]. Coming from the Mediterranean region with its dry summers, this is a cool-season grass that grows mainly from the autumn round to the spring and then can become dormant in the summer[269].","Seed - surface sow, or only just cover the seed, in a greenhouse in early autumn. Germination should take place within a few days. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant out in the following autumn or spring. If you are sowing a large area, then the seed can be sown in situ, preferably in early autumn, though in areas experiencing heavy frosts in the winter it would be best to sow the seed in the spring. A seed rate of 9 - 13 kg per hectare is recommended[269].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
