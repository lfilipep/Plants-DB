21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Anticoagulant  Antifungal  Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Antiseptic  Aromatic  Astringent  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Hypoglycaemic  Stimulant  TB  UrinaryGoldenrod is a safe and gentle remedy for a number of disorders. In particular, it is a valuable astringent remedy treating wounds and bleeding, whilst it is particularly useful in the treatment of urinary tract disorders, being used both for serious ailments such as nephritis and for more common problems such as cystitis[254]. The plant contains saponins that are antifungal and act specifically against the Candida fungus which is the cause of vaginal and oral thrush[238, 254]. It also contains rutin which is used to treat capillary fragility, and phenolic glycosides which are anti-inflammatory[238]. The leaves and flowering tops are anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, febrifuge and stimulant[4, 7, 9, 21, 147, 165]. A good vulnerary herb, it has also proved of value when used internally in the treatment of urinary infections, chronic catarrh, skin diseases, influenza, whooping cough, bladder and kidney stones etc[4, 238]. Due to its mild action, goldenrod is used to treat gastro-enteritis in children[254]. It makes an excellent mouthwash in the treatment of thrush[7]. The plant is gathered in the summer and dried for later use[7]. The seed is anticoagulant, astringent and carminative[218]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[9]. It is used in the treatment of kidney and bladder disorders, rheumatism and arthritis[9]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Solidago virgaurea for infection of the urinary tract, kidney & bladder stones (see [302] for critics of commission E)."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any moderately fertile moisture retentive soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A rather greedy plant, it is apt to impoverish the soil[1]. The bruised plant smells like wild carrots[4]. The sub-species S. virgaurea minuta is only 10cm tall and wide[188]. The plant attracts various beneficial insects such as ladybirds, lacewings and hoverflies to the garden, these insects will help to control insect pests in the garden[201, 238]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
