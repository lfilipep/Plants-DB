14,Physical Characteristics,"Acer campestre is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",

17,Edible Uses Description,"The sap contains a certain amount of sugar and can either be used as a drink, or can be concentrated into a syrup by boiling off the water[4]. The concentration of sugar is considerably lower than in the sugar maples (A. saccharum). The syrup is used as a sweetener on many foods. The tree trunk is tapped in the early spring, the sap flowing better on warm sunny days following a frost. The best sap production comes from cold-winter areas with continental climates.",
18,Medicinal Uses,"Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticholesterolemic  AstringentThe bark is astringent and slightly anticholesterolemic[7]. A decoction has been used to bathe sore eyes[7]. The bark should be sun-dried and then stored in a dry place until required[7].,
20,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The leaves are packed around apples, rootcrops etc to help preserve them[18, 20]. A fast growing plant and bearing clipping well, it makes an excellent clipped hedge and can also be used as part of a native wildlife hedge where it is only trimmed every 3 - 4 years[200, K]. It has also been used in topiary[200].  - fine-grained, tough, elastic, hard to split, takes a high polish and is seldom attacked by insects. Trees are seldom large enough to supply much usable timber, but when available it is much valued by cabinet makers[4, 7, 13, 46, 115]. It is also used for cups bowls etc[115]. The wood of the roots is often knotted and is valued for small objects of cabinet work[4]. The wood is an excellent fuel[4]. A charcoal made from the wood is a good fuel[4, 115].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pollard, Screen, Standard, Superior hedge, Specimen, Street tree. Of easy cultivation, it prefers a good moist well-drained soil[11] in a sunny position but tolerates some shade[11, 200]. Does well on chalky soils, tolerating a pH as high as 8, but becoming a shrub in such conditions[186]. Does not thrive in soils with a pH much below 6[186]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Growth is fast once the trees are established, but this later slows down and trees take about 50 years to reach maturity[186]. Frequently found as a shrub in light woodland, especially under oak. It is one of the first trees to colonize chalk grassland[186]. The field maple is a bad companion plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20]. A good bee plant[7]. This species has often been coppiced in the past for its wood[17]. Trees produce seed in about 10 years from sowing[98].  Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the following spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours and then stratify for 2 - 4 months at 1 - 8°c. It can be slow to germinate. The seed can be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has dried and produced any germination inhibitors) and sown immediately. It should germinate in late winter. If the seed is harvested too soon it will produce very weak plants or no plants at all[80, 113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 20cm or more tall before planting them out in their permanent positions. Layering, which takes about 12 months, is successful with most species in this genus. Cuttings of young shoots in June or July. The cuttings should have 2 - 3 pairs of leaves, plus one pair of buds at the base. Remove a very thin slice of bark at the base of the cutting, rooting is improved if a rooting hormone is used. The rooted cuttings must show new growth during the summer before being potted up otherwise they are unlikely to survive the winter.",
