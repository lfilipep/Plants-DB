22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained humus-rich loamy soil and a position in full sun, though it will tolerate part-day shade[200]. [200] gives a hardiness rating of zone 3 to this plant (tolerating winter temperatures down to about -40°c) but then says that the plant will need the protection of a cold greenhouse in areas where the temperature falls much below freezing[200]. Plants will often self-sow when growing in a suitable position[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse in the autumn, though it can also be sown in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring."
