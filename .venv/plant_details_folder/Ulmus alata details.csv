Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Pyramidal, Rounded, Upright or erect, Vase.","Ulmus alata is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,Leaves: ,,Leaves - raw or cooked.,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It weighs about 46lb per cubic foot, is not considered to be as strong as other elms, but is used for tool handles, wheel hubs etc[46, 61, 82, 149, 227, 229].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a fertile soil in full sun[188], but can be grown in any soil of at least moderate quality so long as it is well drained[1]. A fast-growing tree in its native range[227], but this species does not thrive in Britain[1]. Closely related to U. thomasii[11]. Susceptible to 'Dutch elm disease', a disease that has destroyed the greater part of all the elm trees growing in Britain. The disease is spread by means of beetles. Mature trees killed back by the disease will often regrow from suckers, but these too will succumb when they get larger. There is no effective cure (1992) for the problem, but most E. Asian, though not Himalayan, species are resistant (though not immune) to the disease so the potential exists to use these resistant species to develop new resistant hybrids with the native species[200]. The various species of this genus hybridize freely with each other and pollen is easily saved, so even those species with different flowering times can be hybridized[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - if sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe, it usually germinates within a few days[200]. Stored seed does not germinate so well and should be sown in early spring[200]. The seed can also be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the tree) and sown immediately in a cold frame. It should germinate very quickly and will produce a larger plant by the end of the growing season[80]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Plants should not be allowed to grow for more than two years in a nursery bed since they form a tap root and will then move badly.
