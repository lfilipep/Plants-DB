24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. According to some authorities, the correct name for this species is Angelica cartilaginomarginata[275]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[200]. Plants are reliably perennial if they are prevented from setting seed[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in situ as soon as it is ripe.",
