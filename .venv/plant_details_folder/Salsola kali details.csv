4,Known Hazards,"The plant contains up to 5% oxalic acid, so it should only be used in moderation[269]. Oxalic acid can lock up certain of the nutrients in food and, if eaten in excess, can lead to nutritional deficiencies. It is, however, perfectly safe in small amounts and its acid taste adds a nice flavour to salads. Cooking the plant will reduce the quantity of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",

The seedpods can also be used[4]. Salsolin, one of the constituents of the plant, has been used to regulate the blood pressure. It is said to resemble papaverine in its effect on vasoconstriction and hydrastine in its effect on the smooth muscles of the uterus[269].

23,Other Uses Description,"The ashes of the burnt plant are used for making glass and soap[100]. At one time large quantities of the ashes were imported into Britain for this purpose, but nowadays a chemical process using salt is employed[4]. The ashes can also be used as a cleaner for fabrics[169]. As a low-water-use plant, germinating quickly on minimally disturbed soils, and relatively free of diseases and parasites, this has been suggested as a fuel source for arid lands[269]. Yields of around 3 tonnes per hectare of plant material have been achieved[269]. Dynamic accumulator.",
