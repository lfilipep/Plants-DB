0,Salsola kali,"Saltwort, Russian thistle",Chenopodiaceae,Coming soon,"The plant contains up to 5% oxalic acid, so it should only be used in moderation[269]. Oxalic acid can lock up certain of the nutrients in food and, if eaten in excess, can lead to nutritional deficiencies. It is, however, perfectly safe in small amounts and its acid taste adds a nice flavour to salads. Cooking the plant will reduce the quantity of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Non-saline sandy beaches, avoiding acid soils.

Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Young leaves and stems - raw or cooked[46, 61, 62, 105]. An excellent food[85] with a crunchy tender texture[206]. The leaves can be used as a spinach substitute or added in small quantities to salads[9]. Seed - cooked. It can be ground into a meal and used as a gruel, thickener in soups etc or added to cereal flours when making bread etc[85]. The seed is small and hard to collect any quantity[85].","Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cathartic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Stimulant  VermifugeThe juice of the fresh plant is an excellent diuretic[4]. The seedpods can also be used[4]. Salsolin, one of the constituents of the plant, has been used to regulate the blood pressure. It is said to resemble papaverine in its effect on vasoconstriction and hydrastine in its effect on the smooth muscles of the uterus[269]. Reported to be cathartic, diuretic, emmenagogue, stimulant, and vermifuge, the plant is a folk remedy for dropsy and excrescences[269].","Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Potash: Used for making glass, soap and as a fertilizer.","The ashes of the burnt plant are used for making glass and soap[100]. At one time large quantities of the ashes were imported into Britain for this purpose, but nowadays a chemical process using salt is employed[4]. The ashes can also be used as a cleaner for fabrics[169]. As a low-water-use plant, germinating quickly on minimally disturbed soils, and relatively free of diseases and parasites, this has been suggested as a fuel source for arid lands[269]. Yields of around 3 tonnes per hectare of plant material have been achieved[269]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Requires a very sunny position in a light or medium well-drained soil. Tolerates maritime exposure. The plant is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 26 to 97cm, an annual temperature in the range of 9.2 to 23.8°C and a pH of 7.0 to 7.9[269].
