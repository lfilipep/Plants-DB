See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. baccatum.

Very hot and normally used as a flavouring[183]. The fruit can be dried and ground into a powder for use as a flavouring[142]. The fruit is up to 7.5cm long and 1cm wide[200]. Seed - dried, ground and used as a pepper[2]. Leaves - cooked as a potherb[183]. Some caution is advised, see note at top of the page.","Anaesthetic: Numbs the feeling in a local or general area of the body.,Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles).

It has proved efficacious in dilating blood vessels and thus relieving chronic congestion of people addicted to drink[4]. It is sometimes used as a tonic and is said to be unequalled in warding off disease[4] (probably due to the high vitamin C content[K]). Some caution should be employed, however, since large doses are extremely irritating to the gastro-intestinal system[268]. Used externally, the fruit is a strong rubefacient stimulating the circulation, aiding the removal of waste products and increasing the flow of nutrients to the tissues[254]. It is applied as a cataplasm or liniment[4]. It has also been powdered and placed inside socks as a traditional remedy for those prone to cold feet[254]. A weak infusion can be used as a gargle to treat throat complaints[268]. The fruit is also antihaemorrhoidal, antirheumatic, antiseptic, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, sialagogue and stomachic[7, 165, 171]. These pungent fruited peppers are important in the tropics as gastrointestinal detoxifiers and food preservatives[238]. The fruits contain 0.1 - 1.5% capsaicin[254]. This substance stimulates the circulation and alters temperature regulation. Applied to the skin it desensitizes nerve endings and so has been used as a local anaesthetic[254]. The seed contains capsicidins[254]. These are thought to have antibiotic properties[254]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Capsicum for muscular tension, rheumatism (see [302] for critics of commission E).","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The growing plant repels insects[20].,,"Requires a very warm sunny position and a fertile well-drained soil. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 8.3. This species is a frost-tender perennial that is usually cultivated as an annual[34, 61]. It does not commonly do well outdoors in an average British summer and it is usually grown in a greenhouse in this country[1]. However, if a very warm sheltered position outdoors is chosen then reasonable crops could be obtained in good summers. Widely grown throughout the world, but especially in warm temperate to tropical climates for its edible fruit, tabasco peppers. There are many named varieties[132]. The growing plant is a good companion for aubergines[20].","Seed - sow late winter to early spring in a warm greenhouse[138]. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of reasonably rich soil and grow them on fast. If trying them outdoors, then plant them out after the last expected frosts and give them the protection of a cloche or frame at least until they are established and growing away well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
