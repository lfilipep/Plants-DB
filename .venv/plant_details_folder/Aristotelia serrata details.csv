See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. racemosa. Dicera serrata.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 173].

Plants grow best in light shade[219]. Plants are only hardy in the milder and moister areas of Britain[1, 11], growing well in light woodland[166]. If cut back in severe winters they will often resprout from the sturdier branches[219]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. In its native New Zealand, this is one of the first plants to colonize areas of cleared woodland or waste ground[219]. Plants do not really require pruning[219]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are at least 20cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth in early winter[1]. Take cuttings 15 - 30cm long and plant them in pots or the open soil in a greenhouse. They normally root very easily and can be potted up in early summer then planted out late the following spring[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
