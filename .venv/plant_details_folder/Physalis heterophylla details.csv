Rich soils, especially where the surface has been disturbed[235].","N. America - New Brunswick to Saskatchewan, Florida, Colorado and Texas.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PhysalisHeterophylla.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PhysalisHeterophylla2.jpg",,"Physalis heterophylla is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",P. ambigua.,Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[46, 105, 161]. Quite nice raw though rather small[K], the fruit can also be made into pies, jams, sauces etc[183]. Pectin or pectin-rich fruit should be added if the fruit is used in jams and preserves[183]. The fruit can also be dried, ground into a meal and added to flour for making bread etc[183]. The plant conveniently wraps up each fruit in its own 'paper bag' (botanically, the calyx) to protect it from pests and the elements. This calyx is toxic and should not be eaten.","Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antitumor  Diuretic  Poultice  UrinaryThe seed is considered to be beneficial in the treatment of difficult urination, fever, inflammation and various urinary disorders[222]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of headaches and as a wash for burns and scalds[222]. A poultice of the leaves and roots is applied to wounds[222]. An infusion of the leaves and roots is used as a wash on scalds, burns and VD sores[257]. Compounds in the plant are being investigated for antitumor activity[222].",,None known,,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200]. A polymorphic species[43]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170]. Division in spring[111]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in early summer[111]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
