This species is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5 to -10°c[11, 200]. There is some doubt as to whether this species is distinct from D. delavayi[11]. This genus is closely related to the quince, Cydonia oblonga[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
