The flowers are small. The bark is thick and dark-coloured. The stem yields edible and sweet latex which can also be used in the treatment of amoebiasis and in making chewing gum. The globose, yellow-green fruit is eaten raw. It has sweet and succulent pulp. Infusion of leaves is used as a beverage. The latex is known as glutta-percha and has a wide range of uses like as insulating material for electricity wiring, or moulded into ornate furniture, pistol grips, etc. Further, it is used as the core of golf ball and in modern dentistry. The wood is used for interior millwork, general construction, furniture components, fibreboard, boxes, and crates.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Couma capiron Pittier Couma caurensis Pittier Couma guatemalensis Standl.

It is not very sticky and may be drunk like cow's milk[ 331 ]. A latex obtained from the trunk can be used to make chewing gum[ 46 ]. Fruit - raw[ 625 ]. The succulent pulp is sweet and extremely glutinous[ 625 ]. It contains latex[ 625 ]. The globose, yellow-green fruit is about 6cm in diameter, containing a few seeds[ 625 ]. An infusion of the leaves is used as a beverage[ 331 ].",Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DysenteryA latex in the stems can be used in the treatment of amoebiasis, including amoebic dysentery[ 739 ].","Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers.

When boiled in water it gives a product similar to gutta-percha that can be used for caulking canoes[ 331 ]. Gutta-percha is a natural latex obtained from the sap of the tree. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produces a hard and durable latex that can be made flexible again with hot water, but which does not become brittle. Prior to the advent of synthetic materials, gutta-percha had a wide range of uses - most particularly as an insulating material for electricity wiring and for underwater telegraph wires, a purpose for which it is very well suited since it is bio-inert and so is not attacked by marine plants or animals. Gutta-percha can be moulded into any shape and has been used to make items such as ornate furniture, pistol grips, acid-resistant receptacles and 'mourning' jewellery, where its dark colour was an advantage. It has been widely used as the core of golf balls and is still used in modern dentistry where its bio-inertness makes it ideal as a temporary filling for teeth and as a filling material inside tooth fillings[ 46 , 418 ]. The heartwood is cream-coloured or pale brown, often with a pinkish tinge; there is no sharp demarcation from the sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain fairly straight to inter- locked; lustre rather low to medium; odour and taste not distinctive. The wood is light in weight; moderately hard; natural durability is low and the wood is prone to attacks by blue-stain fungi. It is easy to both air dry and kiln dry, with little or no degradation due to warping or checking. The wood is easy to work with all tools, however, there is some difficulty to generate smooth surfaces on quarter-sawn stock due to the interlocked grain; it is easy to nail and screw, and generally finishes well. The wood is used for interior millwork, general construction, furniture components, veneer for plywood, particleboard and fiberboard, boxes and crates[ 316 , 331 , 625 ].","Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas.

A germination rate in excess of 70% can be expected, with the seeds sprouting within 25 - 35 days[ 625 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
