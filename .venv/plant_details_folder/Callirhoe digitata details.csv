This species is hardy to about -15c[200]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be planted into their final positions as soon as possible[138]. Slugs are strongly attracted to this plant and can destroy even established plants by eating out all the young shoots in spring[K].","Seed - sow outdoors or in a cold frame. Plants resent root disturbance so the seed is best sown in situ in April[138], though the slugs will have a field day if you do not protect the plants[K]. If seed is in short supply then sow it in pots in a cold frame, putting a few seeds in each pot, and plant the pots out in early summer once the plants have put on at least 15cm of growth. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Cuttings of young basal shoots in a frame in sand[1, 200]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division[200].
