Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[33, 183]. A mild, slightly sweet flavour, they are rather more coarse than ordinary lettuce[206], though they make an acceptable ingredient in mixed salads. Old leaves become coarser and bitter[206]. Stem - raw or cooked. Thick, tender, crisp and juicy, its flavour is variously described as being like lettuce, celery, artichoke, squash, asparagus or chard[33, 183]. It is usually peeled before being used[183, 206]. The stems can be harvested just before the plants flower without them turning bitter, though they might become hollow at this stage[206]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Emollient  Expectorant  Parasiticide  SedativeThe whole plant is rich in a milky sap that flows freely from any wounds. This hardens and dries when in contact with the air[4]. The sap contains 'lactucarium', which is used in medicine for its anodyne, antispasmodic, digestive, diuretic, hypnotic, narcotic and sedative properties[9, 21, 46, 165, 192, 213, 238]. Lactucarium has the effects of a feeble opium, but without its tendency to cause digestive upsets[4], nor is it addictive[7]. It is taken internally in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, neuroses, hyperactivity in children, dry coughs, whooping cough, rheumatic pain etc[238]. Concentrations of lactucarium are low in young plants and most concentrated when the plant comes into flower[238]. It is collected commercially by cutting the heads of the plants and scraping the juice into china vessels several times a day until the plant is exhausted[4]. The cultivated lettuce does not contain as much lactucarium as the wild species, most being produced when the plant is in flower[4]. An infusion of the fresh or dried flowering plant can also be used[9]. The plant should be used with caution, and never without the supervision of a skilled practitioner. Even normal doses can cause drowsiness whilst excess causes restlessness[238] and overdoses can cause death through cardiac paralysis[7, 9]. Some physicians believe that any effects of this medicine are caused by the mind of the patient rather than by the medicine[213]. The sap has also been applied externally in the treatment of warts[222]. The seed is anodyne and galactogogue[218]. Lettuce has acquired a folk reputation as an anaphrodisiac, anodyne, carminative, diuretic, emollient, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic, hypnotic, narcotic, parasiticide and sedative[218]."
22,Other Uses,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.
23,Other Uses Description,"[178]. No further details are given, but it is probably the sap of flowering plants that is used. The seed is said to be used to make hair grow on scar tissue[218]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light sandy loam[1]. Succeeds in most well-drained, humus-rich soils but dislikes acid conditions[1, 16]. Prefers some shade in the summer to slow down the plants tendency to go to seed and to prevent the leaves becoming bitter[18, 20]. Plants can resist some frost, they can also tolerate temperatures in excess of 27°c[206]. They are fairly resistant to bolting, though they can run to seed prematurely in very hot conditions[206]. The celtuce is a form of lettuce with a longer and thicker central stem, it is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and stems[206]. There are some named varieties[183]. It takes 3 - 4 months from sowing before the stems are ready to harvest[206]. A surface-rooting plant, the roots can be damaged by hoeing[206]. A good companion for strawberries, carrots, radishes and onions[18, 20]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March to June in situ[206]. Seedlings can be transplanted[206]. Seed becomes dormant at temperatures above 27°c[206].
