13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Apocynum venetum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiotonic  Diuretic  HypotensiveThe leaves or the whole herb is cardiotonic, diuretic and hypotensive[176, 218]. It is used in the treatment of hypertensive headache, dizziness, insomnia, irritability, oliguria and nephritic oedema[176]. It increases the renal blood flow and can be used for renal and cardiac oedema and ascites of liver cirrhosis[176]."
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The bark yields a fibre that is used for making twine, bags, linen etc[46, 61]. It can be harvested after the leaves fall in autumn but is probably at its best as the seed pods are forming[169]. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed fiber or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1]."

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Hay  Regional CropSucceeds in sun or shade in most well-drained but moisture-retentive soils[1, 200]. Plants can be invasive[200]. The flowers are attractive to bees."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in late summer and overwintered outdoors. The seed requires a period of cold stratification if it is to germinate well[238]. Prick out the seedlings when large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting out in late spring of the following year[K]. Division in spring just before active growth begins[200]. Plants can also be divided in the autumn[238]."
