It increases the renal blood flow and can be used for renal and cardiac oedema and ascites of liver cirrhosis[176].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.","The bark yields a fibre that is used for making twine, bags, linen etc[46, 61]. It can be harvested after the leaves fall in autumn but is probably at its best as the seed pods are forming[169]. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed fiber or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1].","Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually.

The seed requires a period of cold stratification if it is to germinate well[238]. Prick out the seedlings when large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting out in late spring of the following year[K].

Plants can also be divided in the autumn[238].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
