Prefers a rich loamy well-drained soil[11, 200]. Very tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. Grows well by the sea, tolerating maritime exposure[184, 200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c if they are sheltered from cold winds[184, 200]. They resprout freely from the base if cut back by cold weather[200] and are deciduous in cold winters[188]. Plants flower on the previous year's growth[200]. The flowers scent the air for a considerable distance with their sweet honey-like fragrance[245].","Seed - cold stratify for 4 weeks at 4°c[138] and surface sow the seed in February/March in a greenhouse[78, 113]. Germination usually takes place within 3 - 4 weeks at 21°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are inclined to damp off and so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Use short side-shoots[78]. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long, October/November in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
