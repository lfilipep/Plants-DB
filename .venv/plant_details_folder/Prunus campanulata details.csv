4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Hill forests below 600 metres[260]. Forests in ravines, forest margins at elevations of 100 - 1300 metres[266]."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A cherry[11], it is edible if the astringency is removed[177]. The fruit is about 11mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[11]. When fully dormant, it probably tolerates temperatures down to about -10 to -15°c[200]. This species grows well in areas that are too warm for other species of flowering cherries[260]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are several named varieties[200]. Closely related to P. cerasoides[109]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200]. Layering in spring."
