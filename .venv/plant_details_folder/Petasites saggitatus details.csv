It is in flower from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Meadow; Bog Garden;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",Salt: plants that provide a substitute for salt.,"Young flower stalks, used before the flower buds appear, are boiled until tender and seasoned with salt[172]. Young leaves - cooked[177]. A felt-like texture[172]. The ash of the plant is used as a salt substitute[172]. The stems and leaves, whilst still green, are rolled up into balls, dried and then placed on top of a very small fire on a rock and burned[207]. A very acceptable condiment for piñole[207].","Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1], but prefers a deep fertile humus-rich soil that is permanently moist but not stagnant, succeeding in shade, semi-shade or full sun[200]. Prefers partial shade[31]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A very invasive plant, too rampant for anything other than the wild garden[187, 200]. Closely related to P. frigidus[60]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe or in early spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division succeeds at almost any time of the year. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
