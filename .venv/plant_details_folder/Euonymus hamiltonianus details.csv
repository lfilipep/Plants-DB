Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are a number of named varieties selected for their good fruiting and autumn colour[184]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[113]. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification so should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[113]. The seed can take 18 months to germinate[74]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, taken at a node, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Root cuttings in winter[113]."
