If planted out when young into a planting hole that has been filled with a light lime-free soil the plants will successfully grow into the surrounding soil[11]. Prefers a warm sheltered position with protection from the morning sun[11]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -15°c[200] but the young growth is liable to be damaged by late frosts[11]. A very ornamental plant[1] but it is slow to establish itself and is slow growing[200]. There are some named varieties[182]. The sub-species S. japonica fargesii is stronger growing in Britain[182]. The flowers have an exquisite scent[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[11]. Stored seed requires 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification[113]. Germination is usually good, prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Layering in autumn.",
