2,Family,Elaeagnaceae
3,USDA hardiness,3-9
4,Known Hazards,"The fruit contains low concentrations of saponins[101]. Although toxic, these substances are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm. They are also broken down by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]."
5,Habitats,"Banks of streams[43] and open wooded areas, often on limestone[101] and on sandy soils[229]."

13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Shepherdia argentea is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in March, and the seeds ripen from July to December. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 11, 61, 161, 257]. It can also be dried and used like currants[3, 46]. A tart but pleasant flavour even before a frost[85, 183], it becomes sweeter after frosts[3, 62, 95]. The fruit is also used for making preserves, pies etc[183]. The fruit should be used in moderation due to the saponin content[101]. The fruit is produced singly or in clusters, it is up to 9mm long and contains a single seed[229]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  Laxative  StomachicThe berries are febrifuge, laxative and stomachic[257]. They have been eaten in the treatment of stomach complaints, constipation and fevers[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plants can be grown as a hedge[160] and windbreak[229]. A red dye is obtained from the fruit[57, 106, 257]. Because it has a wide-ranging root system, forms thickets and is wind tolerant, it is sometimes planted for erosion control[229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Massing. Succeeds in an ordinary well-drained moisture retentive soil[1, 3, 11]. Tolerates poor dry soils[200] and maritime exposure[182]. Established plants are drought resistant[182]. A very cold-tolerant plant[229]. Plants rarely produce fruit in Britain[11]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. 'Xanthocarpa' has yellow fruits[200]. The fruit is difficult to harvest because the shrub is very thorny[3]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed are required.  Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 6 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)"
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it must not be allowed to dry out[113]. It is best harvested in the autumn and sown immediately in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made it will be possible to plant them out in the summer, otherwise grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in the following spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame sometimes work[113]."
