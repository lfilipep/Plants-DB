The dormant plant is fairly cold-tolerant, but the young growth in spring is subject to damage by late frosts[130].","Seed - can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed may require 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[175]. Germination takes 2 - 3 months or more at 15°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half ripe wood, July/August in a frame[130].
