21,Other Uses Description,"The ashes of the wood are used in glazing porcelain[46, 61].  - hard, fine-grained, dark brown. A very valuable wood, it is used for small articles, musical instruments etc[11, 46, 61]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sandy soil[1]. A lime tolerant plant, but it prefers a neutral to acid moist humus-rich soil[130, 182]. It prefers to grow under a light woodland canopy[130, 200]. Plants are hardy at Kew[11] but they grow better in the milder areas of Britain[1]. They rarely exceed 2 metres in height in cultivation and are slow growing[11]. The dormant plant is fairly cold-tolerant, but the young growth in spring is subject to damage by late frosts[130]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed may require 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[175]. Germination takes 2 - 3 months or more at 15°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half ripe wood, July/August in a frame[130]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth in a frame[113]. Layering in September/October of current years growth if possible. If this is not available then use the previous years growth. Takes 18 months. Good percentage[78]."
