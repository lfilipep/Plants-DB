24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist humus rich soil and some shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. Grows well in the dappled shade of woodland[88]. Plants are hardy to at least -25°c[187]. A number of named varieties have been selected for their ornamental value[187]. A good bee and butterfly plant[88]. The flowers have an unusual, slightly unpleasant smell[188]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1]. Only just cover the seed. It germinates in 1 - 12 months or even longer at 15°c[164]. The seed does not store well and soon loses its viability[200], stored seed may germinate better if given 6 - 8 weeks warm stratification at 15°c and then 8 weeks cold stratification[164]. Prick out the young seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Division in spring or autumn[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",
