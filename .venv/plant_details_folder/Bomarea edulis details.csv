24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a warm sunny position and a well-drained slightly acid soil[1, 200]. Succeeds in any good soil in sun or partial shade[187]. One report says that plants are possibly hardy in the milder areas of Britain[1]. However a plant has been growing in an outdoor bed at Kew in light woodland for at least 4 years (1992) where it has flowered and produced seed in most years[K]. Another report says that it is hardy to about -10°c[187]. Plants prefer a minimum night temperature of 10°c[138]. Keep the plants almost dry in winter[138] and apply a good thick organic mulch to the roots[200]. The mulch should be removed as growth commences in the spring because the young shoots are very susceptible to slug damage[K]. The edible roots are sold in local markets in S. America[2]. The tubers should be planted about 15cm deep n the soil[233]. This genus is closely related to Alstroemeria species[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse, it will germinate in a few weeks[1]. Stratify stored seed for 3 weeks at 20°c, then 3 weeks at 5°c[138]. It usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 20°c[138]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring, with care since the roots are brittle. Each portion must have some roots and a growth bud[1]. Pot up the divisions, grow them on in the greenhouse until they are well established and then plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer or late spring of the following year."
