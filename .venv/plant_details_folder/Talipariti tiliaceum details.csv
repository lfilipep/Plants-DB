23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Although its natural habit is a tree, the plant is amenable to pruning and can be grown as a hedge[302 , 307 ]. It is commonly planted as living fencing, whilst a creeping variety is planted as a wind-break in Hawaii[339 ]. It has also been used to reforest eroded land, contain beach erosion, coastal rehabilitation, as a shade tree and a wind-break, especially along the seashore[303 , 307 ]. Other Uses The bark fibres can be used for cordage[302 ]. It is used to manufacture a good quality rope which is can be used for caulking boats and is also used for plaiting mats[303 ]. The green bark peels off easily in wide strips[307 ]. It is used for making a fine fibre and is also beaten out to make traditional tapa bark cloth[307 ]. Tapa cloth is produced by beating strips of bark on a flat surface with a wooden mallet. A very fine cloth can be made in this way, the more the bark is beaten the finer the cloth becomes. Larger sizes can be made by overlapping 2 pieces of bark and beating them together[171 ]. The fibre from the bark has a wide range of other applications, including being used as canoe caulking; to make cordage for clothing and dancing skirts and kilts; coconut-climbing bandages or foot harnesses; mats; sandals; sewing tape; paint brushes; slings; kava strainers[339 ]. The wood, when dried for six months, is used for fireworks[339 ]. The heartwood is a dark greenish brown; the sapwood whitish. The wood is light in weight, moderately soft and porous. The wood is useful for light construction, net floats and corks[302 , 307 ]. An important wood for the Polynesians, who use it for a wide range of purposes, including the outriggers of canoes, carving, house rafters, pig-tethering posts, spreaders, bailers, booms and occasionally hulls, fishing rods, hoists and floats, fishnet frames and handles, bows, fruit-picking rods, tools etc[307 , 339 ]. The wood is used for fuel[307 ]. It makes a decent firewood, especially for slow smoking, and is used in making fire by friction[339 ].  manufactured from H. Tiliaceus pulp is of low quality as the fibres are short (0.7-1.3 mm) and is only suitable for wrapping paper[303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Beach hibiscus is a tropical plant that is usually found in coastal and low elevation habitats, but can be found at elevations up to 800 metres[303 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall of 900 to 2,500mm with a mean maximum temperature 24 - 41°c and a mean minimum temperature of 5 - 24°c[303 ]. Prefers a moist but well-drained, humus-rich, fertile soil in a sunny position[200 , 302 , 307 ]. Succeeds in poor soils[303 ]. The plant is ideally suited to coastal locations and is highly tolerant of salt wind and salty soils[302 , 303 , 307 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[307 ]. The plant coppices readily and, when cut back, produces many long, vigorous shoots with a high fibre production[303 ]. Plants can flower and fruit all year round unless there is a dry season[714 ]. A shallow-rooted species, it is prone to being wind-blown when grown in a windy position, the branches quickly producing new roots from which develop new plants. In this way the plant can form dense thickets over large areas, especially where the trees are growing in soft mud[303 , 307 ]. This habit of regeneration can be common especially after cyclones[303 ]. Flowering Time: Blooms all year. Bloom Color: Pink Scarlet (Dark Red) Pale Yellow. Spacing: 15-18 in. (38-45 cm)."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ or in containers. Germination is usually quite rapid. Prick out container-grown seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions when they are 10cm or more tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood in a frame. Large limbs can be planted as living posts and usually root easily[307 ].
