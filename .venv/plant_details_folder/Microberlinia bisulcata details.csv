The texture is coarse; the grain interlocked, sometimes highly interlocked. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; moderately hard; moderately durable, being resistant to dry wood borers and moderately resistant to fungi and termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood works well with ordinary sawteeth, but there is a risk of tearing due to the highly interlocked grain - tungsten carbide cutting tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct.
