21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The heartwood is a yellow-brown to light brown, with dark brown veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 6 - 10cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain interlocked, sometimes highly interlocked. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; moderately hard; moderately durable, being resistant to dry wood borers and moderately resistant to fungi and termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood works well with ordinary sawteeth, but there is a risk of tearing due to the highly interlocked grain - tungsten carbide cutting tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct. A valuable timber species, often with dark and light streaks, it is used in turnery, high class furniture and cabinet making as well as for tool handles, wood-ware, interior panelling and veneer[349 , 848 ]"
