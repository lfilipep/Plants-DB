22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in any good loam, including chalk, it does not demand much light[1, 11]. Prefers a deep open loam[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A very ornamental tree[1] but it is slow growing in Britain[11]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in an outdoors seedbed as soon as it is ripe[78]. Germination is usually good, though it may take 18 months[80]. If collected whilst still 'green' (after the seed is ripe but before it has dried fully on the plant) and sown immediately it should germinate in the following spring[80]. Grow the plants on for two years in the seedbed and then plant them out into their permanent positions in the winter. The average seed viability is around 65%[98]. Pre-treat stored seed with 4 weeks warm and 12 weeks cold stratification and sow in a cold frame[98]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 15cm tall before planting them into their permanent positions."
