0,Prunus pumila susquehanae,Dwarf American Cherry,Rosaceae,Coming soon,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Sandy beaches, dunes and calcareous shores and ledges[204].","Eastern N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

A rich and pleasantly acid taste when fully ripe though they are sometimes slightly bitter[2, 11, 101, 183]. Eaten out of hand, used in preserves or dried for later use[183]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.",A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168]. Used as a rootstock for the sour cherry[160].,,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[1, 11]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11]. Prefers some chalk in the soil but apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Established plants are very drought resistant[160]. Plants are hardy to about -35°c when fully dormant[160]. Plants are susceptible to mildew in low areas[160]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Thrives in areas with a short growing season[160]. The fruit is highly resistant to all fruit worms[160]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants can produce fruit in 3 years from seed[160].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
