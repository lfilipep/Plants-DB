A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -25°c[187]. Grows well in the summer meadow[24, 187]. The plant is an important source of nectar and pollen for bees and lepidoptera[24, 108]. The plants are sometimes dioecious, if this is the case then male and female plants will need to be grown if seed is required."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have enough seed it would be worthwhile trying a sowing in situ outdoors in the spring. The seed germinates in the spring in the wild. Division in the spring. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
