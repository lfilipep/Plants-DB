See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; East Wall. By. South Wall. By. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Fire retardant: Plants that do not easily burn and can be used in barrier plantings to limit the spread of forest fires.,The plant is fire-resistant.,,"Requires a light lime-free loam[1]. A calcifuge plant, requiring a pH below 6[186]. Grows best in a poor soil[11]. Prefers an open situation[1]. This species is unlikely to be hardy in Britain. One report suggests that it can be grown in the milder areas[1], but another says that it is not frost-tolerant[200]. In the wild the plant is often burnt down in fires, resprouting from the base[260]. Indeed, this regular burning keeps the plant healthy and, in cultivation, it is advisable to prune the plant back hard each year and to dress it with a light dressing of bonfire soil[260]. A good bee plant[108]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - surface sow in a sandy compost in a cold frame in spring. Keep moist. Prick out the plants as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them in their permanent positions when they are 5 - 8cm tall[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 3cm long taken from twiggy lateral growths near the base of the plant, July/August in a frame. Remove the leaves from the bottom part of the stem without causing any damage to the bark. The cuttings root in a few weeks if they are given some bottom heat. Plant out in spring[11]. Layering in spring or autumn. Plants can be 'dropped' and then dug up and divided about 6 - 12 months later. Dropping involves digging up the plant and then replanting it about 15 - 20cm deeper in the soil to encourage roots to form along the stems[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
