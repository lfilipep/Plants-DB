The shoots are harvested when they are still tender enough to be broken off with a fingernail and are used as an asparagus substitute[46, 183].

Likes plenty of humus in the soil[111]. Grows well in a deciduous woodland garden[42, 200] and in the rock garden[200]. Plants grow much taller in rich soils and then succeed in the herbaceous border[222]. They can spread quite quickly when in a suitable position[233]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[187]. This species is closely related to U. caroliniana[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the summer[200]. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division after the plants die down in late summer. It is best carried out in early spring before the plants flower[188]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
