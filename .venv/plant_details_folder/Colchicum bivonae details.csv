0,Colchicum bivonae,,Colchicaceae,5-9,"All parts of the plant, but especially the bulb[200], are poisonous[4, 7, 10, 19, 65]. They cause vomiting, violent purging, serious inflammation of the stomach and bowels, and death[232]. Handling the corms can cause skin allergies in some people[238].","Mountainous regions in pinewood and scrub around 500 metres[90, 148].",S.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf from March to June, in flower from September to October, and the seeds ripen from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is self-fertile. Suitable for: medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. bowlesianum. C. latifolium. C. sibthorpii. Baker.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Plant breeding: Used in producing new species of plants or improved varieties.,"The poisonous alkaloid 'colchicine' is extracted from this plant and used to alter the genetic make-up of plants in an attempt to find new, improved varieties[148]. It works by doubling the chromosome number[89].",,"Prefers a rich well-drained loam that does not dry out rapidly in summer[1]. Requires a very sunny position[90]. This is a very difficult species to grow outdoors because of its susceptibility to slug damage, it is best grown in a bulb frame[90]. Plants can take 4 - 5 years to flower when grown from seed[164]. Plant the bulbs about 7 - 10cm deep in July[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early summer in a seed bed or a cold frame[1, 164]. Germination can be very slow, taking up to 18 months at 15°c[164]. It is best to sow the seed thinly so that it is not necessary to transplant the seedlings for their first year of growth. Apply a liquid fertilizer during their first summer, however, to ensure they get sufficient nourishment. Prick out the seedlings once they are dormant, putting perhaps 2 plants per pot, and grow them on in a greenhouse or frame for at least a couple of years. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. The seedlings take 4 - 5 years to reach flowering size[1]. Division of the bulbs in June/July when the leaves have died down[1]. Larger bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out. The plant can be divided every other year if a quick increase is required[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
