21,Other Uses Description,"The poisonous alkaloid 'colchicine' is extracted from this plant and used to alter the genetic make-up of plants in an attempt to find new, improved varieties[148]. It works by doubling the chromosome number[89]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich well-drained loam that does not dry out rapidly in summer[1]. Requires a very sunny position[90]. This is a very difficult species to grow outdoors because of its susceptibility to slug damage, it is best grown in a bulb frame[90]. Plants can take 4 - 5 years to flower when grown from seed[164]. Plant the bulbs about 7 - 10cm deep in July[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early summer in a seed bed or a cold frame[1, 164]. Germination can be very slow, taking up to 18 months at 15°c[164]. It is best to sow the seed thinly so that it is not necessary to transplant the seedlings for their first year of growth. Apply a liquid fertilizer during their first summer, however, to ensure they get sufficient nourishment. Prick out the seedlings once they are dormant, putting perhaps 2 plants per pot, and grow them on in a greenhouse or frame for at least a couple of years. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. The seedlings take 4 - 5 years to reach flowering size[1]. Division of the bulbs in June/July when the leaves have died down[1]. Larger bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out. The plant can be divided every other year if a quick increase is required[1]."
