18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"A jelly is made by boiling the whole plant. It is nutritious and medicinal[5, 55, 61]. Rather bitter, it requires leaching, which can be done by changing the cooking water once or twice during the cooking process[172]. The dried and powdered plant can be mixed with wheat and used in making bread[2, 46, 61]. It is very bitter and the process required to leach it is far too time-consuming and tedious to be countenanced[9].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Nutritive: A food for convalescents to help restore strength.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibiotic  Antiemetic  Appetizer  Demulcent  Disinfectant  Dysentery  Galactogogue  Nutritive  TonicIceland moss has been used since ancient times as a cough remedy and has also been used in European folk medicine as a cancer treatment[254]. In present day herbalism it is highly prized for its strongly antibiotic and demulcent actions, being used especially to soothe the mucous membranes of the chest, to counter catarrh and calm dry and paroxysmal coughs - it is particularly helpful as a treatment for elderly people[254]. Iceland moss has both a demulcent and a bitter tonic effect within the gut - a combination almost unique amongst medicinal herbs[254]. The whole plant is strongly antibiotic, antiemetic, strongly demulcent, galactogogue, nutritive and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 61, 165, 238, 254]. It is excellent when used internally in the treatment of chronic pulmonary problems, catarrh, dysentery, chronic digestive disturbances (including irritable bowel syndrome and food poisoning) and advanced tuberculosis[4, 254]. Externally, it is used in the treatment of boils, vaginal discharges and impetigo[238]. The plant can be harvested as required throughout the year[7], preferably during dry weather, and can also be dried for later use[9]. Use with caution[21]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Cetraria islandica for cough & bronchitis, dyspepsia, inflammation of mouth and pharynx, loss of appetite (see [302] for critics of commission E).",
22,Other Uses,"Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A powerful antibiotic can be obtained from the plant and this has become a fundamental ingredient in a wide range of commercially produced disinfectants[7]. A brown dye is obtained from the plant[46, 61].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"There is no known information on the cultivation of this plant[238]. It requires clean air and is very intolerant of atmospheric pollution so cannot be grown in towns[238]. See the plants native habitat above for ideas on how it can be encouraged to grow[K]. This species is a lichen, which is actually a symbiotic association of two different species, one an algae and the other a fungus. It is very slow-growing[9]. This plant is often used in commercially produced disinfectants[7].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The only way of reproducing this plant is vegetatively. Almost any part of the plant can be used to produce a new plant, simply separate a portion and place it in its new home.",
