Succeeds in limey soils. Grows well in heavy clay soils. It prefers a sunny position but succeeds in semi shade though it is apt to get leggy if grown in the shade of trees[182]. Succeeds against a north-facing wall[219]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. Plants are medium to fast growing[202]. Flowers are produced on wood that is more than one year old[202]. Any pruning is best done immediately after the plant has finished flowering[182, 200]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[11, 200]. This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Blooms are very showy. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 2 months[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 15cm taken at a node, July/August in a frame. Plant out in autumn or spring. A very high percentage, they root within 3 weeks[78]. Cuttings of mature wood in a sheltered outdoor bed. Good percentage[78]. Layering in spring or summer. Plants often self-layer[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
