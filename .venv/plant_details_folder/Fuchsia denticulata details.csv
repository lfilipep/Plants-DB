24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil[200]. Succeeds in a good loam if sand and leafmold are added[1]. This species is frost-tender in Britain, though it can succeed in a cold greenhouse. It might succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, especially if given the protection of a wall[K]. Another report says that it is totally intolerant of frost[260], though we feel that this might be a misprint[K]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[108]. This species has a long tubular flower and is pollinated by humming birds in the wild[260]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K]."
