24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Cloves thrive in lowland humid tropical areas where the temperature is fairly steady, growing best in an island setting at elevations below 300 metres[200 ]. Notions about the ecological requirements of the clove vary, perhaps because of an underlying dilemma: a climate with a marked dry season promotes flowering, but the tree does not cope at all well with stress[303 ]. There are two ways out of this dilemma. The first is to choose a climate with a pronounced dry season, but to limit stress by going for deep fertile soils, providing water and shade during the early years[303 ]. The other way is to choose a wet climate with a short dry season[303 ]. The best quality cloves for use as a spice are grown in the wetter climates where annual rainfall is in excess of 1,500mm and usually in the range 3,000 - 4,000mm[303 ]. Requires a light, well-drained soil, requiring some shade, especially when young[200 ]. Growth can be sustained on poor and acid soils, but waterlogging is very harmful[303 ]. Requires shelter from the wind[303 ]. The clove tree is monoecious, flowers are hermaphrodite and self-pollinating. The tree matures between 8-10 years after planting[303 ]. Clove trees live for more than 100 years, the oldest tree recorded is aged 375 years in Indonesia[303 ]. Generally, it takes 20-30 years for clove to attain full bearing[303 ]. Bloom Color: White/Near White(orange, yellow)."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - the seed has a short viability of about 2 weeks so should be sown as soon as it is ripe in shady nursery beds, placing the seeds about 25mm deep in the soil[303 ]. About 70% of the seeds germinate, usually after 1 - 6 weeks[303 ]. Plant out when they are about 25cm tall[303 ]. Cuttings of terminal leafy softwood, kept in a frame at high humidity until they have rooted[200 ]."
