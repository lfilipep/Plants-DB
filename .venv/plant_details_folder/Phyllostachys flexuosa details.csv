13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Phyllostachys flexuosa is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 6 m (19ft) by 6 m (19ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[25, 61, 105, 177]. A delicious flavour[266]. Slightly acrid raw, they are usually boiled in at least one change of water and added to salads etc[183]. The canes are about 10mm in diameter[K]. The shoots, which are generally 2- 4cm in diameter, though occasionally up to 7cm[266], are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,The canes are not of the highest quality but can be used for plant supports etc. The medium quality wood is good for all standard bamboo uses for canes of this size[195]. The culms are used as handles of tools[266]. The splints made from the stems are used for weaving articles[266].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position[200] and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -17°c. According to another report the plant only suffers minor leaf damage at -22°c[195]. The plants dislike prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. A plant at Trebah gardens in Cornwall was flowering heavily in May 1995[K]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. The rootstock is running[25] but not aggressively so, especially in the cooler climate of Britain[200]. New growth appears from late March[25]. This species is closely related to P. angusta[266]. Plants need quite a lot of space because the outer culms spread out sideways and arch over[162]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring."
