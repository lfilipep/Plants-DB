22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[182, 200]. Thrives in a chalky soil[182] but prefers a light loam or peaty soil[11]. Very resistant to maritime exposure[11]. Plants are not very hardy outside the milder western and south-western maritime areas of Britain, they only tolerate light frosts[11, 200]. They succeed when grown against a sunny wall in the London area[11]. Plants can be pruned right back into old wood in order to promote fresh growth. Any pruning is best done in the spring[11]. Flowers best in years following long hot summers[200]. The flowers are very aromatic.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in early spring in a greenhouse. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. If growth has been sufficiently good, plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, otherwise grow them on for another year in pots and plant them out the following early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in late August and overwinter in a cold frame then plant out in late spring or early summer[78]. Good percentage[11]. Cuttings of moderately ripe wood of the current years growth, 5 - 10cm with a heel, November in a frame. High percentage[78].",
