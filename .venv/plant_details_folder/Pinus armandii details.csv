13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pinus armandii is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."
15,Synonyms,P. mastersiana. P. scipioniiformis.

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked[63]. Esteemed as a great delicacy[105, 177, 183], the oil-rich seed has a slightly resinous flavour. Up to 13mm x 11mm[200]. A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc.  - soft. The timber is used for construction, railway sleepers, furniture, and wood fibre[46, 61, 266]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. This species grows well in Britain[120]. The best growth in this country is found in Sussex, trees also grow well in Ireland. Annual increases in height are normally moderate but the best trees have been increasing by 60cm a year. Increase in girth can be as high as 5cm a year[185]. A plant at Kew, accession no 000-69.10663, was bearing a good crop of cones in 2000[K]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby inhibiting the growth of other plants below the tree[18]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. An evergreen. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81]."
