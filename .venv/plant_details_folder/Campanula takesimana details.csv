19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[K]. A mild flavour with a subtle sweetness, especially in the spring and early summer they taste just like lettuce and are a pleasant addition to mixed salads[K]. In the height of summer, the leaves often develop a slightly bitter flavour, especially if the plant is growing in a sunny position[K]. Flowers - raw. Beautiful to look at, the flowers have a delicate sweetness and are a pleasant addition to salads[K]. Roots - raw, cooked or dried for later use. Known as 'do-ra-jee' in Korea, where they are eaten as a delicacy. The roots are a bit small and fiddly to utilize, though they are said to have a simply delicious flavour."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in most well-drained soils[233]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. This species is closely related to C. punctata[233, 271]. The plant spreads freely at the roots and can become rampant in lighter soils, though it is easily controlled by hoeing (or eating!)[233, 271, K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow May/June in situ. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. If the seed is in short supply it would be best to sow it in pots in a cold frame in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring."
