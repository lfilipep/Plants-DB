24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A spreading rhizome herbaceous Perennial flowering earlier than many other asters. Flowers are small but abundant (to 1 inch across). It needs average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in sun, part shade to full shade. Thrives in shade and tolerates dry conditions. Prefers shade to sun. Growth Habit: Clump-forming. Flowering Period: Aug to Oct. Flower Colour: White. Flower: Showy. Time to full growth: 2 to 5 years. Little problem with both disease and insects. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1) .",
