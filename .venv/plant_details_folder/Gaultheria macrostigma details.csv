0,Gaultheria macrostigma,,Ericaceae,7-10,None known,Montane to lower sub-alpine open grassland and rocky places in North South and Stewart Islands from 39° and southwards[44].,New Zealand.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Gaultheria macrostigma is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in) by 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",G. antipoda microphylla. G. depressa microphylla. G. perplexa. Pernettya macrostigma. Colenso.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,Fruit - raw or cooked[173]. Fairly large[182]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,A good ground cover for sun or light shade.,,"Requires a light well-drained lime-free soil[1]. The plant can make a good nesting place for mice, these mice then eat the bark of the stems in winter causing die-back. Dioecious. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required. This species, however, does not need a male pollinator in order to fruit well. It also hybridizes freely in the wild with other members of this genus[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. Pre-chill for 4 - 10 weeks and surface sow in a lime-free compost in a shady part of the greenhouse and keep moist[78]. The seed usually germinates well, usually within 1 - 2 months at 20°c, but the seedlings are liable to damp off. Watering them with care and making sure you give them plenty of ventilation will reduce this risk. Watering them with a garlic infusion can also help to prevent this[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are about 25mm tall and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. The seedlings are susceptible to spring frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 3 - 6cm long, July/August in a frame in a shady position. They form roots in late summer or spring[78]. A good percentage usually take. Division in spring just before new growth begins. 'Drop' the plants 12 months earlier by digging them up and replanting them deeper in the soil so that the branches are buried and can form roots. This works best in a sandy soil[78]. It is best to pot up the divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse until they are established. Plant them out in the summer. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
