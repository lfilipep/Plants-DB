It is in flower from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

20,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Very wind hardy, succeeding in maritime exposure, it can be grown as a shelter hedge though it dies down in winter[K]. Although they die down in the winter they quickly attain their full height each season[200].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropPrefers a deep fertile loamy soil that does not dry out in summer[200] but succeeds in any ordinary soil that is not too dry[1, 162], in sun or light shade[200]. Very wind tolerant. Plants can be grown as a focal point in lawns, they also succeed in quite coarse grass[233]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c when fully dormant[200], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Closely related to M. floridulus[233]. The leaves have saw-toothed edges and can cut the unwary gardener, it is best to wear gloves when working with the plant[200]. A rhizomatous plant, but it is slow to spread[188]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a greenhouse and keep moist. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or early autumn[200]. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
