See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from March to April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",X. apiifolia. Zanthorrhiza apiifolia.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover;,,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",,"Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antihaemorrhoidal  Astringent  Stomachic  TonicThe root is astringent and a blood tonic[222]. A tea made from the roots is used to treat mouth ulcers[213], stomach ulcers, colds, jaundice etc[222, 257]. An infusion of the roots has also been used to treat piles, though the report does not specify if it is used internally or externally[257]. Some caution is advised in the use of this plant, see the notes above on toxicity. The root contains the alkaloid 'berberine' which is used for its tonic properties and for digestive disorders[213]. Berberine is anti-inflammatory, astringent, haemostatic, antispasmodic, immuno-stimulant, uterine tonic and antimicrobial[222]. It stimulates the secretion of bile and bilirubin and may be helpful in correcting high tyramine levels in people with liver cirrhosis[222].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A yellow dye is obtained from the root[46, 61]. The entire plant can be crushed to yield a yellow dye[257]. A good ground cover for damp semi-shaded positions[11, 200]. Plants should be spaced about 1.2 metres apart each way[208].",,"Requires a moist acid soil in sun or part shade[184]. Prefers shade or semi-shade[188]. Succeeds in any moist fertile soil according to other reports[1, 182, 200]. Hardy to about -20°c[184]. Plants can spread considerably by means of suckers[182], especially when they are growing in a light soil[208]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame in late winter. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in the autumn or late winter[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
