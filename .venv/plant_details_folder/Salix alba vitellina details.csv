13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix alba vitellina is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

19,Edible Uses Description,"- raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc[2]. A very bitter flavour[115], it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Leaves and young shoots - raw or cooked[2, 177]. Not very palatable[172]. They are used only in times of scarcity[105]. The leaves can be used as a tea substitute[61]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Antiperiodic  Antiseptic  Astringent  Bach  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Hypnotic  Sedative  TonicJustly famous as the original source of salicylic acid (the precursor of aspirin), white willow and several closely related species have been used for thousands of years to relieve joint pain and manage fevers[254]. The bark is anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiperiodic, antiseptic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge, hypnotic, sedative and tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 165]. It has been used internally in the treatment of dyspepsia connected with debility of the digestive organs[4], rheumatism, arthritis, gout, inflammatory stages of auto-immune diseases, feverish illnesses, neuralgia and headache[238]. Its tonic and astringent properties render it useful in convalescence from acute diseases, in treating worms, chronic dysentery and diarrhoea[4]. The fresh bark is very bitter and astringent[222]. It contains salicin, which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[213]. The bark is harvested in the spring or early autumn from 3 - 6 year old branches and is dried for later use[7, 9]. The leaves are used internally in the treatment of minor feverish illnesses and colic[238]. An infusion of the leaves has a calming effect and is helpful in the treatment of nervous insomnia[7]. When added to the bath water, the infusion is of real benefit in relieving widespread rheumatism[7]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Salix / Willow for diseases accompanied by fever, rheumatic ailments, headaches (see [302] for critics of commission E)."
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Young stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[13, 46, 61]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The bark can be used for tying plants[61]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used in making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in spring or summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then beaten with mallets or put through a blender. The paper is red/brown in colour[189]. A fast growing tree and tolerant of maritime exposure, it can be grown as a shelterbelt[75].  - elastic, soft, easy to split, does not splinter. Used for construction, turnery, poles, tool handles etc[11, 46, 61]. Also used to make charcoal[11]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200] and dislikes poor thin soils[186]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure and atmospheric pollution[75, 186]. Trees respond well to coppicing or pollarding[186]. Best planted into its permanent position as soon as possible, trees respond badly to transplanting unless they are moved regularly. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. A very important food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies[30] and a good bee plant, providing an early source of nectar and pollen[11]. A very good wildlife habitat, more than 200 species of insects are associated with this tree[24]. The female of this sub-species has been cultivated for its very tough stems that are used as tie rods in basket making[123, 131]. This species is used commercially in papermaking[189]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, especially S. fragilis, to which it is closely related[11]. Trees cast a relatively light shade. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Branches of older wood as long as 2.5 metres can be used[1]. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy."
