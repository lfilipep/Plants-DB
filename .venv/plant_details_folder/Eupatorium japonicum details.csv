24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary well-drained but moisture retentive garden soil in sun or part shade[200]. A very polymorphic species[58], it is closely related to E. cannabinum[1]. This species is a member of natural moist grassland flora on river banks in the Kanto District of Japan. Due to urbanization of this area, the habitat is now restricted to a very small area, and the species is endangered[275]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, the clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions."
