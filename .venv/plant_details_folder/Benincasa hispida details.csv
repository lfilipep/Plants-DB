24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a warm sunny position in a rich well-drained soil and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1, 200, 238]. Established plants are reasonably drought tolerant[206]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.8 to 6.8. This species is not very frost hardy, it is best grown in a greenhouse in Britain[86] but can succeed outdoors in good summers if started off in a greenhouse and planted out after the last expected frosts. Plants require stable temperatures in excess of 25°c if they are to do well[200]. Short daylengths and lower temperatures stimulate female flower development, higher temperatures stimulate male flower production[200]. Plants take 5 months from seed to produce a mature crop, though the fruits can be eaten when immature[206]. The wax gourd is frequently cultivated for its edible fruit in the tropics, there are many named varieties[183]. One group, sometimes classified as B. hispids chieh-gua, is known as the hairy melon or jointed gourd. This form is grown for its immature fruit in much the same way as courgettes are used[206]. Mature fruits of this form do not develop a waxy coating[206]. The fruit can be harvested about 3 months after sowing[206].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse. Germination should take place within 3 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on fast in a rich compost in the greenhouse. Try to maintain a minimum night temperature of at least 10°c for the seedlings first few weeks[206]. Plant out in May/June after the last expected frosts[1].",
