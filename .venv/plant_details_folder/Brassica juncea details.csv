0,Brassica juncea,Brown Mustard,Brassicaceae or Cruciferae,6-9,Mustard allergy possibly especially in children and adolescents. Retention of seeds possibly in intestines if taken internally [301].,Cornfields in Britain[17].,N. Europe to C. Asia. Rarely naturalized in Britain[17].,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BrassicaJuncea.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BrassicaJuncea2.jpg",,"Brassica juncea is a ANNUAL growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",B. japonica. B. juncea japonica. Sinapis juncea.,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Oil: ","eaves - raw or cooked[22, 33, 46, 52, 61]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[206]. The leaves can also be eaten raw, when finely shredded they make a very acceptable addition to mixed salads[206]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[183]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[52]. Sweet and succulent[133]. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[1, 2, 17, 57, 183]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[74]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[171]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[183], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[238]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[238]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[238]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[238]. The root of some forms of this species is edible[183]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads.","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antibiotic  Aperient  Diuretic  Emetic  Galactogogue  Rubefacient  StimulantAlthough not usually used medicinally, the seed is a warming stimulant herb with antibiotic effects[238]. Reported to be anodyne, aperitif, diuretic, emetic, rubefacient, and stimulant, Brown Mustard is a folk remedy for arthritis, foot ache, lumbago, and rheumatism[269]. The seed is used in the treatment of tumours in China[269]. In Korea, the seeds are used in the treatment of abscesses, colds, lumbago, rheumatism, and stomach disorders[269]. The root is used as a galactagogue in Africa[269]. Ingestion may impart a body odour repellent to mosquitoes[269]. Mustard oil is used in the treatment of skin eruptions and ulcers[269]. Believed to be aperient and tonic, the volatile oil is used as a counterirritant and stimulant[269]. In Java the plant is used as an antisyphilitic emmenagogue[269]. Leaves applied to the forehead are said to relieve headache[269]. The Chinese eat the leaves in soups for bladder, inflammation or haemorrhage[269].","Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","There is some evidence that if this plant is grown as a green manure it is effective in reducing soil-borne root rots in pea crops[206]. This is attributed to chemicals that are given off as the plants decay[206]. Brassica juncea is used in phytoremediation to remove heavy metals, such as lead, from the soil in hazardous waste sites because it has a higher tolerance for these substances and stores the heavy metals in its cells. In particular, Schneider et al. found that Brassica juncea was particularly effective at removing cadmium from soil.",,"Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[16, 200, 206]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[16]. Dislikes very hot weather[33]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[206]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 8.3. Brown mustards is widely cultivated for its edible seed which is used to make the condiment 'brown mustard' and is also sprouted as the mustard of mustard and cress[50, 200]. It has only 70% of the pungency of black mustard (B. nigra) but can be harvested mechanically so is more viable commercially[238]. This species has also been cultivated in the Orient for many hundreds of years and a wide diversity of forms has been developed with edible leaves, stems, roots and seeds. These forms have been classified by the botanists as follows and separate entries have been made for each of them. B. juncea crispifolia. The curled or cutleaf mustards, this group has attractively curled edible leaves. B. juncea foliosa. The leaf mustards have quite large smooth-edged edible leaves. B. juncea japonica. Rather similar to B. juncea crispifolia and combined with that group by some botanists. B. juncea multiceps. The multishoot mustard group. B. juncea napiformis. A form with a swollen edible root. B. juncea rugosa. Large somewhat cabbage-like edible leaves. B. juncea strumata. A form with large edible leaf stalks. B. juncea tumida. A form with swollen edible stems. Plants take from 2 - 5 months from sowing to maturity, depending on the season and the cultivar[206]. They prefer a fairly high stable temperature and are well adapted to short day length[200]. Many are best grown in warmer climates than Britain but there are several cultivars that grow well in this country[206]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[269]. A good bee plant[74].","Seed - sow in situ from early spring to early autumn in order to obtain a succession of edible leaves. Most varieties of Oriental vegetables belonging to this species are best sown from late June to early September otherwise they may bolt[206]. There are about 5,660 - 6,000 per 0.01 kg (1/3 oz)[269].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
