24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Salvia leucantha is native to the subtropics and tropics of Mexico and Mesoamerica. It is a bushy evergreen sub-shrub that grows in a loose, spreading mound. It is not very resistant to frosts but can tolerate occasional light ones. The top growth will often be killed off if temperatures fall below zero for more than short periods. However, root growth will survive if temperatures do not fall below -8°c for more than short periods - new development will then resprout from the base when the weather warms up. In colder climates with hot summers, the plant can be grown from seed as a summer-flowering annual [352 ].  A low-maintenance plant. Salvia leucantha grows well in an average to rich, evenly moist, well-drained soils in full sun [352 ]. It tolerates some light afternoon shade but generally is best when grown in full sun. It also handles some drought but does best with regular moisture [352 ]. Heat zone 4-12. Sometimes grown as a hedge[317].",
26,Plant Propagation,Propagation is by cuttings or dividing the mound into several clumps.,
