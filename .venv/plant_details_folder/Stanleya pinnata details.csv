Grows well at Kew in a warm sunny well-drained border[K]. There is some confusion over the correct name of this plant, 2 different spellings having been used. Whilst it is possible that these are 2 different plants, it is more likely that the name used at the top of this form is the correct one, whilst the name in the synonyms list is a mis-spelling[161, K]. The plant is often found growing in soils rich in selenium and is a fairly good indicator that selenium is present[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Germination should take place within 3 weeks. Pot up into individual pots as soon as the plants are big enough to handle in order to preserve the root system. Plant out in summer. Division in spring?
