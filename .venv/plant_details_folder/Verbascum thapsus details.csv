It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Cultivated Beds;,,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","An aromatic, slightly bitter tea can be made by infusing the dried leaves in boiling water for 5 - 10 minutes[183]. A sweeter tea can be made by infusing the fresh or dried flowers[183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiseptic  Astringent  Demulcent  Emollient  Expectorant  Homeopathy  Narcotic  Odontalgic  VulneraryGreat mullein is a commonly used domestic herbal remedy, valued for its efficacy in the treatment of pectoral complaints[4]. It acts by reducing the formation of mucus and stimulating the coughing up of phlegm, and is a specific treatment for tracheitis and bronchitis[254]. The leaves and the flowers are anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antispasmodic, astringent, demulcent, diuretic, emollient, expectorant and vulnerary[4, 7, 13, 21, 46, 53, 165, 222]. An infusion is taken internally in the treatment of a wide range of chest complaints and also to treat diarrhoea[4, 238]. The plant combines well with other expectorants such as coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris)[254]. Externally, a poultice of the leaves is a good healer of wounds and is also applied to ulcers, tumours and piles[4, 222, 254]. Any preparation made from the leaves needs to be carefully strained in order to remove the small hairs which can be an irritant[7]. The plant is harvested when in flower and is dried for later use[238]. An infusion of the flowers in olive oil is used as earache drops, or as a local application in the treatment of piles and other mucous membrane inflammations[4, 222, 238]. This infusion is also strongly bactericidal[4]. A decoction of the roots is said to alleviate toothache and also relieve cramps and convulsions[4]. The juice of the plant and powder made from the dried roots is said to quickly remove rough warts when rubbed on them[4]. It is not thought to be so useful for smooth warts[4]. The seeds are slightly narcotic and also contain saponins[4]. A poultice made from the seeds and leaves is used to draw out splinters[4]. A decoction of the seeds is used to soothe chilblains and chapped skin[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh leaves[4]. It is used in the treatment of long-standing headaches accompanied with oppression of the ear[4].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.,Wick: Used as a wick for candles, lamps etc.","Landscape Uses: Border - a very ornamental plant. A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers by boiling them in water[4]. When used with dilute sulphuric acid they produce a rather permanent green dye, this becomes brown with the addition of alkalis[4, 13, 100, 168]. An infusion of the flowers is sometimes used to dye the hair a golden colour[4, 200]. The flowering stems can be dipped in wax and used as torches[53, 106, 124]. The down on the leaves and stems makes an excellent tinder when quite dry[4, 53, 115]. It is also used as an insulation in shoes to keep the feet warm[4, 200] and to make wicks for candle[1, 4, 13, 100, 115, 124]. One report says that the leaves contain rotenone, though it does not say in what quantity[222]. Rotenone is used as an insecticide[K].

Dynamic accumulator.",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most well-drained soils, including dry ones, and prefers a sunny position[200]. Dislikes shade and wet soils[200]. Thrives on chalk[200]. Prefers a light soil[200]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus, though the progeny are usually sterile[200]. A very ornamental plant, it often self-sows, especially on dry calcareous soils[53, 124]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1].  In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].","Seed - sow late spring to early summer in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in late summer. The seed has a long viability[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
