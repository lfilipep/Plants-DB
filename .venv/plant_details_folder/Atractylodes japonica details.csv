24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. This species is closely related to A. lancea[174]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in sun or partial shade[238]. This species is dioecious. Both male and female plants need to be grown if seed is required[266]. Another report says that the plant is monoecious, bearing both female and bisexual flowers[279]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the following spring or early summer.
