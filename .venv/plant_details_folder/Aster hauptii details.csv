24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most good garden soils[1], preferring one that is well-drained and moisture retentive[200]. Prefers a sunny position[200]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. There is some confusion over this name. One report says that A. hauptii. Ledeb. is a synonym for Galatella hauptii. (Ledeb.)Lindl[74]. This is a name that is not at present accepted by most botanists and need not concern us[K]. However, the report then goes on to say that A. hauptii. Turcz. is a synonym of Galatella dahurica. DC. (which equals A. dahuricus. (DC.)Benth.), a plant found in shrubberies, forest edges and meadows up to the mountain zone[74]. We assume that our record refers to A. hauptii. Ledeb. but there must be some doubt about this[K]. Just to further confuse matters, one synonym for this species is A. fastigiatus. Ledeb. and there also seems to be an A. fastigiatus. Fisch. Some further investigation is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]."
