See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 3, 34]. Sweet and juicy[11], A raspberry-type fruit, it is smaller than a raspberry, contains rather a lot of seeds and is not quite such a flavourful fruit, but it makes very nice eating all the same[K]. After flowering, the fruit is enclosed in its calyx until just before it is ripe, this prevents maggots etc getting into the fruit[K]. The fruit is about 20mm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200], preferring light shade[202]. Plants are not too happy when grown in windy situations[K]. Hardy to about -18°c[202]. Some damage may be caused at this temperature but plants usually recover well[202]. A very ornamental plant, its red stems adding colour to the winter garden[1], it is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit[1, 61]. There is at least one named variety, 'Bella di Tokyo' has small tasty red fruits[183]. This species is a raspberry with biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].","Seed - requires stratification, is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed as early as possible in the year in a cold frame and stratify for a month at 3°c if sowing later than February. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
