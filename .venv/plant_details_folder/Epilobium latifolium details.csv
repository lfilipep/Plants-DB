13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Epilobium latifolium is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

A good source of vitamins A and C[257]. Flower stalks - raw or cooked. Eaten when the flowers are in bud[85]. The dried leaves are used as a tea substitute[85, 177, 183]. The core of mature stems is eaten raw. Slightly sweet, tender and pleasant tasting[85, 172]. Very fiddly though[85]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained but moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Succeeds in most soils[1]. The roots are somewhat spreading and the plant can become invasive[233]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 3. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in situ or as soon as the seed is ripe. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
