0,Chenopodium leptophyllum,Narrow Leaved Goosefoot,Chenopodiaceae,Coming soon,"The leaves and seeds of all members of this genus are more or less edible. However, many of the species in this genus contain saponins, though usually in quantities too small to do any harm. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]. The plants also contain some oxalic acid, which in large quantities can lock up some of the nutrients in the food. However, even considering this, they are very nutritious vegetables in reasonable quantities. Cooking the plants will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Dry soils and sandy coasts[43]. Open, often disturbed sandy areas and fields at elevations of 400 - 3400 metres[270].","N.

The raw leaves should only be eaten in small quantities, see the notes above on toxicity. Seed - cooked. It can be ground into a powder and mixed with wheat or other cereals in making bread etc[46, 61, 95, 105, 161, 257]. The seed is small and fiddly, about 1mm in diameter[270], it should be soaked in water overnight and thoroughly rinsed before it is used in order to remove any saponins.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.
