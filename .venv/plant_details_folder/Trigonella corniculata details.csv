It is occasionally cultivated for its edible young leaves, there is at least one named variety[183]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a well-drained loamy soil in full sun[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in situ.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
