24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. It is occasionally cultivated for its edible young leaves, there is at least one named variety[183]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a well-drained loamy soil in full sun[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring in situ.,
