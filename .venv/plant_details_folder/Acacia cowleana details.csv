4,Known Hazards,"The seed of many Acacia species, including this one, is edible and highly nutritious, and can be eaten safely as a fairly major part of the diet. Not all species are edible, however, and some can contain moderate levels of toxins[1295 ]. Especially when harvesting from the wild, especial care should be taken to ensure correct identification of any plants harvested for food[K ]. Especially in times of drought, many Acacia species can concentrate high levels of the toxin Hydrogen cyanide in their foliage, making them dangerous for herbivores to eat."
5,Habitats,Usually occurs on sandy or stony soils. It suits warm semi arid regions. It can stand long periods of drought. It grows in Northern Australia. It cannot tolerate fire. It cannot tolerate frost. It can grow in arid places. Grows mainly along the banks of seasonal creeks[286].

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Edible Portion: Seeds. Seed - cooked[397 , 418 ]. It can be eaten in the same ways as other small legume seeds and is also ground into a powder then used as a flavouring in desserts or as a nutritious supplement to pastries and breads[1295 ]. The pods are up to 75mm long and 3.5 - 5mm wide, with dark brown to black, more or less oblong seed around 3.5 - 5mm long[286 , 1300 ]. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain around 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480 Â±270 kJ per 100g. The seeds are low glycaemic index foods - the starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise[1295 ]. Carbon Farming - Staple Crop: protein."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  DysenteryThe bark of all Acacia species contains greater or lesser quantities of tannins and are astringent. Astringents are often used medicinally - taken internally, for example. they are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, and can also be helpful in cases of internal bleeding. Applied externally, often as a wash, they are used to treat wounds and other skin problems, haemorrhoids, perspiring feet, some eye problems, as a mouth wash etc[601 , K ]. Many Acacia trees also yield greater or lesser quantities of a gum from the trunk and stems. This is sometimes taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and haemorrhoids[601 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Acacia cowleana is a fast growing, short-lived species often used in seed-mixes for mine site rehabilitation. It has the ability to regenerate from basal coppice, however, it more commonly regenerates from seed (especially following disturbance)[1298 ]. Other Uses: The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[418 ].  Carbon Farming - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, windbreak. Other Systems: FMAFS."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Historic Wild Staple: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Other Systems: FMAFS: Farmer-Managed Agroforestry Farming Systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Historic Wild Staple  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  New Crop  Other Systems: FMAFS  Staple Crop: ProteinClimate: Tropical. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. Acacia cowleana is a plant of the arid to semi-arid zone of subtropical and tropical Australia, where it is found at elevations up to 650 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 35°c, but can tolerate 12 - 45°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth is more tender can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 250 - 400mm, but tolerates 200 - 500mm[418 ]. Requires a sunny position. Prefers a well-drained soil, though plants can tolerate seasonal inundation of the soil[418 ]. Grows best in light to medium-textured soils, and is tolerant of low fertility[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418 ]. Acacia cowleana is not widely grown but should be a reliable shrub for temperate to arid climates in reasonably well drained soils. It has been successfully cultivated in California[397 ]. A fast-growing but fairly short-lived species with a life span of 5 - 12 years[418 ]. The seeds of most acacia species can be quickly and efficiently harvested at full maturity without the need for any specialised equipment. Small seed-bearing branches can be cut and beaten on sheets, or bushes can be beaten or shaken directly onto large sheets[1294 ]. Closely related to and previously confused with the tetraploid species Acacia elachantha[286 ]. This species has been rarely cultivated compared to its close relative Acacia elachantha . This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[1300 ]. Carbon Farming -  Cultivation: historic wild staple, new crop. Management: standard, coppice."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires pre-treatment to break down the hard coat[303 ]. Pouring a small amount of boiling water over the seeds (which cools down quickly and so does not cook the seed), and then leaving to soak for 12 hours is usually effective, as is making a small incision in the coat to allow water to penetrate. Germination levels of 40 - 80% take place in 6 - 15 days[303 ]. Treated seeds are sown in germination beds, and seedlings are transplanted into polythene bags when they reach the 2-leaf-pair stage. Seeds can also be sown straight into polythene bags. Young seedlings should initially be kept at 50% sunlight, but this can be increased to 70% once they have been established. In general, 3 - 4 months are needed to raise seedlings to a plantable size, 25 cm in height[303 ]. Seeds stored in airtight containers at room temperature retain their viability for several years[303 ]. Cuttings may succeed but the success rate may be well below 100%[397 ]."
