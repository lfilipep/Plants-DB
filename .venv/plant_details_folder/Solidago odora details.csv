It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

Seed[177]. No more details are given but the seed is very small and fiddly to harvest[K]. An aromatic, anise-flavoured tea is made from the dried leaves and dried fully expanded flowers[21, 55, 95, 183]. The blossoms are used as a flavouring[102].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

The leaves make a very pleasant-tasting tea that is mildly astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge and stimulant[21, 95, 207, 222, 257]. It is useful in the treatment of coughs and colds, dysentery and ulceration of the intestines[4, 257]. The essential oil has been used as a diuretic for infants, as a local application for headaches and for the treatment of flatulence and vomiting[4]. The flowers are aperient, astringent and tonic[4]. An infusion is beneficial in the treatment of gravel, urinary obstruction and simple dropsy[4]. The root can be chewed as a treatment for sore mouths[257].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.","An anise-scented essential oil is obtained from the plant[61].

Tolerant of very poor sandy soils[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A rather greedy plant, it is apt to impoverish the soil[1]. The bruised leaves have a smell like a mixture of sassafras and aniseed[245]. The plant attracts various beneficial insects such as ladybirds, lacewings and hoverflies to the garden, these insects will help to control insect pests in the garden[201, 238]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in spring or early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
