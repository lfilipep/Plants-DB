25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the tropical, humid lowlands[ 320 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 28 - 42°c, though it can tolerate 5 - 49°c[ 418 ]. It can resist occasional light frosts, with new growth being killed at -1°c, but dormant growth being tolerant down to -3°c[ 418 , 598 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall of 750 - 4,000mm, tolerating 500 - 5,000mm and preferring a distinct dry season[ 418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[ 307 ].

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sown fresh, without pre-treatment, they have a high germination rate[ 404 ]. Some reports suggest germination rates can be improved by pre-soaking the seeds for 12 hours prior to sowing[ 404 ], this is likely to refer to seeds that have dried somewhat[ K ]. Seeds can be sown in a sunny position, either in situ or in nursery beds. Sprouting takes place in 10 - 25 days[ 404 ]. Transplant 5cm tall seedlings to individual containers and plant out 12 months later[ 404 ]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood.",
