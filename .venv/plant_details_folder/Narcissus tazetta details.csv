The dormant bulbs will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -5°c[214]. A polymorphic species[200]. Cultivated for its essential oil[171]. The flowers are very powerfully scented[245]. The sub-species N. tazetta chinensis. Roemer. is used in Japanese medicine[174].,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. A short stratification will improve the germination of stored seed. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be left undisturbed in the pot for their first two years of growth. Give them an occasional liquid feed in the growing season to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. When the plants become dormant in the summer, pot up the small bulbs placing 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another one or two years in the greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant in late summer. Division of bulbs after the leaves die down in early summer[1]. Larger bulbs can be replanted immediately into their permanent positions, or can be stored in a cool place and then be planted out in the autumn. It is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year before planting them out when dormant in the autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
