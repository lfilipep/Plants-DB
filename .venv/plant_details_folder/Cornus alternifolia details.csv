It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiaphonic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  Ophthalmic  Poultice  Stimulant  VDGreen osier was employed medicinally by a number of native North American Indian tribes who valued it particularly for its astringent bark which was used both internally and externally to treat diarrhoea, skin problems etc[257]. It is little used in modern herbalism. The dried bark is used as an astringent, diaphoretic and stimulant[213, 257]. The inner bark was boiled and the solution used as an enema[213] and this solution was also used as a tea to reduce fevers, treat influenza, diarrhoea, headaches, voice loss etc[213, 257]. It was used as a wash for the eyes[257]. A compound infusion of the bark and roots has been used to treat childhood diseases such as measles and worms[257]. It has also been used as a wash on areas of the body affected by venereal disease[257]. A poultice of the powdered bark has been used to treat swellings, blisters etc[257].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A light to dark-brown dye is obtained from the roots with the addition of vinegar[226].  - heavy, hard, close grained. It is too small to be of commercial value, but is used locally for turnery[82, 229].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils and in dry soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. A fast-growing but short-lived species in the wild[229], it is closely related to C. controversa[200]. This species is unusual in having alternate leaves whilst almost all other members of this genus have opposite leaves[182]. Plants have a thin bark and this makes them susceptible to forest fires[229]. There is at least one named form selected for its ornamental value[188]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
