See the plants native habitat for ideas on its cultivation needs. Plants sometimes produce cleistogamous flowers. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water and sow in situ in mid spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
