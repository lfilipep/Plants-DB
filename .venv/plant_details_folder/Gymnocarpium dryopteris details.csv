13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Gymnocarpium dryopteris is a deciduous Fern growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A small deciduous Mat forming fern with a slender creeping rhizome, and much-divided, triangular to ovate fronds. USDA Hardiness Zones: 2 - 7. Soil pH: 4.5 - 6.4. Growth Rate: Slow to moderate. Life Span: Long. Texture: Fine. Sun: Partial Shade, Shade. Prefers a neutral to acid, leafy, moist soil, enriched with garden compost, in deep shade. Soil Type: Loamy. Soil Moisture: Moderate. Minimum Root Depth: 12 inches (30cm). Root Type: Long Rhizome. Seasonal Interest: Spring-Fall. The broadly triangular leaves are divided into 3 approximately equal primary divisions, each turned to a heavily horizontal position. Sprawling, it often shows slightly twisted leaves and leaflets. Requires cool, moist, acidic soil. Good ground cover. Drought: Intolerant. Flood: Moderate. Salt: Sensitive. Soil Compaction: Intolerant. Mowing: Intolerant. Fire Damage: Intolerant. Cold Injury: Infrequent. Disease Issues: Minor. Insect/Pest Damage: Minor. Plant Concerns: Oak fern can interfere with the growth of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) seedlings. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length  [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,Sow spores at 15°C (59°F) when ripe or divide in spring,
