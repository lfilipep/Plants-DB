Seasonal Interest: Spring-Fall. The broadly triangular leaves are divided into 3 approximately equal primary divisions, each turned to a heavily horizontal position. Sprawling, it often shows slightly twisted leaves and leaflets. Requires cool, moist, acidic soil. Good ground cover. Drought: Intolerant. Flood: Moderate. Salt: Sensitive. Soil Compaction: Intolerant. Mowing: Intolerant. Fire Damage: Intolerant. Cold Injury: Infrequent. Disease Issues: Minor. Insect/Pest Damage: Minor. Plant Concerns: Oak fern can interfere with the growth of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) seedlings. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length  [1-2].",Sow spores at 15°C (59°F) when ripe or divide in spring,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
