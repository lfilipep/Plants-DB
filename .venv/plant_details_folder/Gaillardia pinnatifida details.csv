24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a position in full sun, succeeding in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Performs well in poor soils and copes well with hot dry conditions[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Some winter protection, especially in areas experiencing heavy snows, is recommended. Covering the plants with brush wood should be enough[200]. Plants are so prolific and long blooming that they often exhaust themselves and are then short-lived[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division, with care[200]. Root cuttings in the winter[200]."
