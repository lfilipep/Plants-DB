24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any soil in full sun[187, 200], but prefers a fertile sandy loam[200]. Dislikes poorly-drained heavy clay soils, but grows well in clay if grit is added for drainage[11, 200]. Does well on chalk. Dislikes winter wet[200]. Succeeds in acid as well as alkaline soils[200]. Plans are hardy to about -25°c[187]. A twining plant[182]. The leafstalks wrap themselves around twigs and branches for support. When a side of the stalk touches an object, the growth on that side slows down whilst the other side grows at its normal rate - this causes the leaf stalk to entwine the object it is touching[212]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[233]. When planting out, in order to avoid the disease 'clematis wilt', it is best to plant the rootball about 8cm deeper in the soil. This will also serve to build up a good root crown of growth buds[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[164, 200]. Sow stored seed as soon as it is obtained in a cold frame. Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and remove as much of the tail and outer coat as possible[164]. A period of cold stratification is beneficial[164]. The seed germinates in 1 - 9 months or more at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Internodal cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, late spring in sandy soil in a frame[200]. Layering of old stems in late winter or early spring[200]. Layering of current seasons growth in early summer[200]."
