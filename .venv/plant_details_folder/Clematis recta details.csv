0,Clematis recta,Ground virginsbower,Ranunculaceae,3-7,"Although no reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, some if not all members of this genus are mildly poisonous. The toxic principle is dissipated by heat or by drying[65].","Scrub, forest, river valleys and sunny hills[74, 187].",S. and E.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",,"Young shoot tips - cooked or pickled[177].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Homeopathy  RubefacientThe flowers and leaves are diaphoretic, diuretic and rubefacient[4]. They are taken both internally and externally in the treatment of syphilitic, cancerous and other foul ulcers[4]. Caution is advised since this is a poisonous plant[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism and skin eruptions[238].",,None known,,"Succeeds in any soil in full sun[187, 200], but prefers a fertile sandy loam[200]. Dislikes poorly-drained heavy clay soils, but grows well in clay if grit is added for drainage[11, 200]. Does well on chalk. Dislikes winter wet[200]. Succeeds in acid as well as alkaline soils[200]. Plans are hardy to about -25°c[187]. A twining plant[182]. The leafstalks wrap themselves around twigs and branches for support. When a side of the stalk touches an object, the growth on that side slows down whilst the other side grows at its normal rate - this causes the leaf stalk to entwine the object it is touching[212]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[233]. When planting out, in order to avoid the disease 'clematis wilt', it is best to plant the rootball about 8cm deeper in the soil. This will also serve to build up a good root crown of growth buds[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[164, 200]. Sow stored seed as soon as it is obtained in a cold frame. Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and remove as much of the tail and outer coat as possible[164]. A period of cold stratification is beneficial[164]. The seed germinates in 1 - 9 months or more at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Internodal cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, late spring in sandy soil in a frame[200]. Layering of old stems in late winter or early spring[200]. Layering of current seasons growth in early summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
