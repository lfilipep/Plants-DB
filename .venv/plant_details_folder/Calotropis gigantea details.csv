13,Summary,"Native to parts of Southeast Asia, India, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal, Crown Flower or Calotropis gigantean is a fast-growing, large shrub that reaches up to 4 m tall with clusters of white or lavender waxy flowers. The leaves are light green and oval. Crown flower produces a durable fiber known as 'Bowstring of India' used in making ropes and carpets among others. The plant reportedly has antifungal and insecticidal properties. In traditional medicine, crown flower is used as treatment for common diseases such as fever, coughs and colds, eczema, rheumatism, nausea, and diarrhoea. It yields poisonous latex that is used in poisoning arrows. The latex is also used for treatment for sprains, boils, body pains, and pimples. The bark is used for neurodermatitis and syphilis. Mature seed pods are sources of floss that have a wide range of uses. The wood is used as fuel and made into charcoal. Note. Sometimes misspelt as: Calotropis giganteus",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Calotropis gigantea is an evergreen Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Butterflies, Wasps. It is noted for attracting wildlife.

23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: High (4/5). Seaside, Specimen, Large Planter, Coastal Screening, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: As it thrives upon soils where nothing else will grow, needing neither culture nor water, it has been considered a good plant for bringing waste land under tillage and for reclaiming drifting sands[ 454 ]. The leaves can be used for mulching, green manuring of rice fields and for binding sandy soil[ 299 ]. The plant is sometimes grown as a hedge[ 299 ]. Other Uses: A fine fibre is obtained from the bark of the stems[ 266 , 302 , 454 ]. Very strong, it is said to possess many of the qualities of flax (Linum usitatissimum), though it is somewhat finer[ 46 , 454 ]. It is much used for making textiles, fishing nets and bowstrings[ 307 , 454 ]. The mature seed pods contain a large quantity of floss, which has a variety of uses. For example, it can be used to stuff pillows etc or mixed with other fibres to make cloth[ 112 , 159 , 169 , 171 , 454 ]. It is a Kapok substitute, being very water repellent it can be used as a buoyancy aid in Life Jackets or as a stuffing material[ 112 ]. The floss absorbs oil whilst repelling water and so has also been used to mop up oil spills at sea. Candlewicks can be made from the seed floss[ 112 , 207 ]. The twigs are used as chewsticks for cleaning the teeth[ 299 , 307 ]. The juice is used in making a yellow dye and in tanning[ 266 ]. The wood is sometimes used for fuel, but it is of poor quality[ 299 ]. However, a good quality charcoal is obtained from the wood and can be used for making gunpowder[ 272 , 299 , 307 ]. Attractive flowers are long lasting and used for floral arrangements. May exhibit mosquito controlling properties against Culex gelidus and Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes which serves as vectors for Japanese encephalitis. Host to a variety of insects and butterflies including Hawaii's non-migratory monarch butterflies. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon, fiber. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed fiber or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropSucceeds in the drier tropics. Most commonly found in areas of the tropics with a specific dry season, at elevations up to 1,000 metres[ 299 ]. An excellent plant for the seaside garden[ 307 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil in a sunny position[ 302 ]. Succeeds in a variety of soils, but prefers littoral, sandy soils[ 299 ]. Plants can thrive in dry sands[ 454 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[ 307 ]. Plants are tolerant of salt-laden winds[ 307 ]. One hectare of ground stocked with plants 30cm apart can yield 24 tonnes of green stems, from which 260 - 350 kilos of fibre can be obtained[ 454 ]. The plant is of great religious significance in India, where it is sacred to the God Shiva[ 307 ]. Plants can flower all year round, but the main flowering is in the hot season[ 299 ]. Carbon Farming - Climate: tropical. Humidity: arid to humid. Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard, coppice.",
