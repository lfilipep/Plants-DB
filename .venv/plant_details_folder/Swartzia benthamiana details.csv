13,Summary,"Wamara, Swartzia benthamiana, is a tree commonly found in South America that grows up to 30 m in height. It has a small crown and a straight bole with few low buttresses and can be 40 - 50 cm in diameter. It has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria that form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Though not edible, it serves medicinal purposes. The trunk yields red latex which can be used to ease toothache. The leaves and bark when crushed are also used as relief from toothache. The wood is suitable for heavy construction and woodwork."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Swartzia benthamiana is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Uses Description,None known
18,Medicinal Uses,"Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diaphoretic  OdontalgicThe red latex that is obtained from the trunk is put on a piece of cotton which is then packed into the cavity of a tooth to relieve toothache[348 ]. The crushed leaves and bark are decocted and applied to aching teeth[348 ]. The plant (part not specified) is used as a sudorific[348 ].
20,Other Uses,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: A red latex is obtained from the trunk. It is used medicinally[348 ]. Heartwood is only found in the largest trees. It varies from a chocolate brown to a pale reddish purple or purplish brown, occasionally marked by dark olive or purplish-brown coloured stripes. The very wide sapwood is white in colour. The texture is very fine; lustre good; the grain generally straight but may be variable; odour or taste is not distinctive in dry wood. The wood is extremely heavy, very dense, hard, compact, very strong, and resilient[378 ]. It is variously reported as being very difficult to moderately difficult to work with either hand or machine tools, for it is a hard, high-density wood. But there is general agreement that the wood finishes smoothly, turns very satisfactorily (as do many other very dense woods), and polishes well. It takes nails badly and needs preboring for the use of nails or screws[378 ]. The heartwood is generally reported to be very resistant to decay, but the sapwood, which makes up the bulk of the lumber produced, is not durable. The wood is rated resistant to damage by the dry-wood termite[378 ]. The heartwood is one of the most attractive woods on the export market, it is used for inlay, walking sticks, bagpipes, parquet flooring, and bows, and is recommended as a substitute for ebony for it polishes to a high lustre. The whitish sapwood is used in some localities for implement frames and spokes of wheels; the heartwood for posts, articles of turnery, furniture, cabinetwork, and heavy and durable construction. The sapwood has been recommended as a substitute for hickory (Carya) for those purposes requiring very strong, tough, and resilient material[378 ]. The wood should be well fitted for many other uses requiring a heavy, hard wood having high bending and compression strength, abrasion resistance, and durability[378 ]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 600 metres. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]."
