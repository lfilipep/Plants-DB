13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Elaeagnus commutata is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 3, 43, 106]. Dry and mealy[11, 95, 172, 183]. Good when added to soups they also make an excellent jelly[183]. The fruit must be fully ripe before it can be enjoyed raw, if even slightly under-ripe it will be quite astringent[K]. The fruit contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cancer  Salve  VDA strong decoction of the bark, mixed with oil, has been used as a salve for children with frostbite[257]. A decoction of the roots, combined with sumac roots (Rhus spp.), has been used in the treatment of syphilis[257]. This medicine was considered to be very poisonous and, if you survived it, you were likely to become sterile[257]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214]."
22,Other Uses,"Beads: Used as necklaces etc.,Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute."
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as a hedge in exposed positions, tolerating maritime exposure. They have a rather open habit, however, and so do not afford a lot of wind protection. Because they fix atmospheric nitrogen, they enrich the soil and so make a very good companion hedge in orchards etc[K]. The fibrous bark is used in weaving, it has been twisted to make strong ropes and has also been used to make blankets and clothing[99, 257]. Dried fruits are used as beads[99, 257]. The berries have been used to make a soap[257]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils that are well-drained[200], though it dislikes shallow chalk soils[98]. This last report conflicts rather with the record of its natural habitat, it should grow well on chalk[K]. Prefers a light sandy soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in poor and dry soils[11, 200]. Requires a position in full sun[11, 200]. Plants are very drought and wind resistant[1, 11, 200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -40°c[184]. However, plants prefer a continental climate and are liable to be cut back in severe winters in Britain mainly because the wood is not fully ripened in our cooler summers. A moderately fast-growing plant[202]. The small flowers are deliciously scented[245]. This species does not normally require pruning but the plant can regenerate from very old wood and so can be cut back severely if required[202]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[202]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%. Often confused with E. angustifolia even though it is very distinct[50]. Plants produce suckers quite freely, often sending them up at some distance from the plant[182, K]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 6 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, October/November in a frame[200]. The cuttings are rather slow and difficult to root, leave them for 12 months[113]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78]. Division of suckers during the dormant season[3, 11]. The larger suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, but it is probably best to pot up smaller suckers and grow them on in a cold frame until they are established."
