20,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
21,Other Uses Description,The plants extensive and invasive root system make it a useful ground cover for erosion control[195].,
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils but prefers a good loamy soil[1] in a sheltered position in semi-shade[25]. Dislikes drought[1]. Requires shelter from cold northerly and north-easterly winds[11]. The rootstock is running and invasive[25]. New shoots are produced from late May[25]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of several years, they often produce fertile seed[122]. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They occasionally die after flowering, but if left alone they will normally recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - if possible, surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Stored seed should be sown as soon as it is received. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse or cold frame until they are large enough to plant out, which could be a number of years. The plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division as the plant comes into growth in spring. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].",
