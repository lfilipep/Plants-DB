Yet another report says that it should succeed outdoors in the milder and drier counties, but that it is not very long-lived[233]. The flowers are very attractive to bees. The flowers are pink or red.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 13°c[133].
