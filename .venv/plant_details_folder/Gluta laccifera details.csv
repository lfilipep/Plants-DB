13,Summary,"Commonly found in Southeast Asia, Gluta laccifera is a deciduous tree highly valued for its lacquer that can be tapped from its trunk. The lacquer or varnish is locally utilized and exported. The resinous wood exudate is toxic and can cause severe skin irritation thus timber should be dried and exposed for several years. The wood is used for fine furniture, turnery, cabinet work, etc.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Gluta laccifera is a deciduous Tree growing to 18 m (59ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",

23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: A natural lacquer or varnish is obtained from the trunk[439 ]. To obtain the varnish, V-shaped incisions, 22cm long and 15cm apart at the base, are cut on the bark of the trees, the apex pointing down. The tongue of bark within these scars is then slightly lifted up and a specially prepared joint of bamboo driven in horizontally immediately below the apex of the incision. The sap which exudes from the inner bark drains into the bamboo receiver. This is emptied at the end of ten days, when the flow of varnish is observed to become scanty[439 ]. A second cut is made along each side of the contained tongue of bark, which is also again raised up slightly and the bamboo receiver placed more conveniently to the new scarification. After this has yielded all the varnish that seems likely, a new incision is made a little higher up[439 ]. It would appear that young trees yield better than fully formed ones[439 ]. The tree is largely utilised in its liquid state as a natural varnish, and has the great merit of preserving woodwork. Thickened by sawdust, cow-dung ashes, or bone-ashes to a plastic condition, it is employed as a cement and body material or moulding substance[439 ]. It may be coloured with lamp-black, gold-leaf, vermilion (not red lead), orpiment, indigo, etc., and applied with a brush or by the hand direct, or to objects revolving on the turning-lathe[439 ]. When painted on cloth or paper the form used is very thin and pure, but on drying the articles are found to have been rendered waterproof[439 ]. A resinous exudate from the wood can cause severe skin irritation[451 ]. The poisonous constituent of the resinous sap is volatile and will gradually disappear. For this reason, the timber of this tree must be dried and exposed for several years as it is otherwise dangerous to handle. ed articles or furniture made from the dried timber may still be toxic to persons who are especially susceptible[451 ]. We have no specific description for the wood of this species - the following description is a general one for the timber producing species in this genus. The heartwood is a deep blood red, darkening on exposure, streaked with bands of darker colour; the sapwood is a light pink brown to almost white, usually rather wide. The texture is rather fine to moderately coarse; the grain straight to irregular; without characteristic odour or taste; mostly without lustre; only moderately durable and not highly resistant to termite attack. The green material is easier to cut than the dry wood; it works well with hand and machine tools and dresses smoothly; takes a high polish; there can be a severe dulling of cutters due to silica content. The wood is used for fine furniture, turnery, cabinetwork, specialty items, decorative veneers, joinery[316 ].",
