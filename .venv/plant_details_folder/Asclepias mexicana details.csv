0,Asclepias mexicana,,Asclepiadaceae,5-9,"Although no specific reports have been seen for this species, many, if not all, members of this genus contain toxic resinoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides[274]. They are usually avoided by grazing animals[274]. The flowers are considered to be poisonous by some Indian tribes[161, 177].",Not known,South-western N. America - C. Mexico.,(1 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsclepiasMexicana.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsclepiasMexicana2.jpg",,"Asclepias mexicana is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies).  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",A. mexicana. Rydb. non Cav. = A. fascicularis. Decne.,Cultivated Beds;,Flowers: ,,"Young blossoms - cooked[161, 177]. Some caution is advised, see the notes on toxicity at the top of the page.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Latex: A source of rubber.,Rubber can be made from latex contained in the leaves and the stems[112].,,"Prefers a well-drained light rich or peaty soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds in poor soils. There is some confusion over nomenclature. A. mexicana. Rydb. is a synonym of A. fascicularis and the reports on the uses of this plant did not specify the authors name[60]. We have assumed that the uses refer to A. mexicana. Cav. There is also some confusion over the hardiness of this plant with one report saying that it needs greenhouse protection in Britain[1] whilst another says that it is hardy to zone 6, or about -20°c[200]. Many members of this genus seem to be particularly prone to damage by slugs. The young growth in spring is especially vulnerable, but older growth is also attacked and even well-established plants have been destroyed in wet years[K]. Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted into their final positions whilst small[134]. The flower of many members of this genus can trap insects between its anther cells, the struggles of the insect in escaping ensure the pollination of the plant[207].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn or in late winter[134, 169]. We have also had good results from sowing the seed in the greenhouse in early spring[K], though stored seed might need 2 - 3 weeks cold stratification[134]. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 3 months at 18°c[134]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out when they are in active growth in late spring or early summer and give them some protection from slugs until they are growing away strongly. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and place them in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse until they are growing away strongly, then plant them out in the summer, giving them some protection from slugs until they are established.. Basal cuttings in late spring. Use shoots about 10cm long with as much of their white underground stem as possible. Pot them up individually and place them in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse until they are rooting and growing actively. If the plants grow sufficiently, they can be put into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in the greenhouse until the following spring and when they are in active growth plant them out into their permanent positions. Give them some protection from slugs until they are established.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
