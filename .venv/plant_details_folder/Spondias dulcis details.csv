It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 27°c, but can tolerate 12 - 35°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -3°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 900 - 1,800mm, but tolerates 600 - 2,200mm[418 ]. Trees need to be grown in a sunny position, very little fruit is produced when they are in the shade[306 ]. Plants are not too fussy over soil, not needing very fertile conditions. However, very poor soil, or shallow land, is unsuitable[200 ]. It succeeds on limestone derived soils as well as on acid sands, but the soil should be well drained[306 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418 ]. The branches are quite brittle, so a sheltered position is best[306 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant, though they may briefly lose their leaves when under stress[306 ]. Plants can bear fruit in only 4 years from seed, or 2 - 3 years from cuttings[306 , 335 ]. In areas where there is no prolonged dry season, the plant can flower and fruit all year round, though in pronounced monsoonal areas it will usually flower only in the dry season[306 ]. Flowering Time: Blooms repeatedly. Bloom Color: White/Near White Inconspicuous/none.","Seed - germinates within one month[306 ]. Quite large cuttings[200 ]. It is reported that large stumps are stuck in the ground to obtain live fence posts[306 ]. Air layers root easily[306 ]. Grafting or shield budding on Spondias rootstocks is also possible, however seedling trees are more vigorous than budded or grafted trees[306 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
