It is very heavy and very hard and preferred in making cabinets, furniture, marquetry, and parquet flooring. It is also used in musical instrument, carvings, turnings, and for tombs.","Dalbergia louvelii is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.

It is one of the favoured woods for musical instruments and is locally in high demand for carving and turning. It has been used traditionally for tombs[ 299 ].",,"This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 299 ].","Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
