Main Bloom Time: Early spring. Form: Spreading or horizontal.","Epimedium grandiflorum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.3 m (1ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil.",E. macranthum. E. violaceum.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover;,Leaves: ,,"Young plant and young leaves - cooked[105, 179]. Soaked and then boiled[177].

Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiasthmatic  Antibacterial  Antirheumatic  Antitussive  Aphrodisiac  Hypoglycaemic  Tonic  VasodilatorThe aerial parts of the plant are antiasthmatic, antibacterial, antirheumatic, antitussive, aphrodisiac, hypoglycaemic, tonic and vasodilator. Its use lowers blood sugar levels[116, 176]. It is used in the treatment of impotence, seminal emissions, lumbago, arthritis, numbness and weakness of the limbs, hypertension and chronic bronchitis[176]. It has an action on the genitals similar to the male sex hormone and can increase the weight of the prostate gland and seminal vesicle, it has increased copulation in animals and increases the secretion of semens[176]. The leaves are used as an aphrodisiac[218]. Administered orally, the leaf extract increases the frequency of copulation in animals[218].",,A good ground cover plant[200].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Succeeds in any fertile humus-rich soil[200], preferring a moist but well-drained peaty loam[1, 280]. Requires a lime-free soil[280]. Grows best in the light dappled shade of a woodland[200, 280]. Plants can succeed in the dry shade of trees[233]. A shallow-rooting plant, the rhizomes creeping just below the soil and the finer roots occupying the top 30cm of the soil[280]. A clump-forming species, the rhizomes making only short new growth each year, it needs to be divided every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain vigour[280]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187], though the flowers in spring can be damaged by late frosts[233]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are several named varieties[187]. It grows well in the rock garden or wild garden[1]. Plants are self-sterile and so more than one clone is required for cross-fertilization in order for seed to be produced. Plants will often hybridise with other species growing nearby[280]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in late summer[200, 280]. Sow stored seed as early as possible in the year in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in the cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in mid to late summer[K]. Division, best carried out in August to September according to one report[280], in late spring according to another[200]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Cuttings in late summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
