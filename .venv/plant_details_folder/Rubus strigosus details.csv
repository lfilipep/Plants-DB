America - Newfoundland to British Columbia, south to New Mexico.",(3 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Rubus_strigosus1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Rubus_strigosus2.JPEG",,"Rubus strigosus is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",R. strigosus.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked in pies, preserves etc[1, 2, 3, 34, 85, 101, 183]. Young shoots - harvested as they emerge through the ground in the spring, peeled and eaten raw or cooked like asparagus[85, 101, 161, 183]. The leaves and twigs are used as a tea substitute[161, 183].","Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Decongestant: Removes phlegm and mucous, especially from the respiratory system.,Oxytoxic: Hastens parturition and stimulates uterine contractions. See also birthing aids.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  Astringent  Birthing aid  Cardiac  Decongestant  Oxytoxic  Refrigerant  StimulantAntiemetic[13, 165]. The leaves and roots are anti-inflammatory, astringent, decongestant, ophthalmic, oxytocic and stimulant[4, 13, 165, 222, 254]. A tea made from them is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, as a tonic for the uterus to strengthen pregnant women, and as an aid in childbirth[4, 222, 257]. The tea has also been shown as effective in relieving painful menstrual cramps[222]. The active ingredients both stimulate and relax the uterus[222]. They can be used during the last three months of pregnancy and during childbirth, but should not be used earlier[238]. Externally, the leaves and roots are used as a gargle to treat tonsillitis and mouth inflammations, as a poultice and wash to treat sores, conjunctivitis, minor wounds, burns and varicose ulcers[238, 257]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and dried for later use[9]. The fruit is antiscorbutic and diuretic[7]. Fresh raspberry juice, mixed with a little honey, makes an excellent refrigerant beverage to be taken in the heat of a fever[21]. Made into a syrup, it is said to have a beneficial effect on the heart[21].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. A parent of some of the cultivated raspberries[11, 34], it is often used in modern breeding programmes[119]. This species has biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
