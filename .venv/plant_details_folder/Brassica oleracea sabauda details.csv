18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 16, 46]. The leaves have a very attractive crinkled appearance, but are somewhat tougher than other cabbages. Finely shredded, they can be used in salads, though many people find them indigestible this way. They are delicious cooked, especially the younger leaves since the older ones can be quite tough[K]. Through careful selection of varieties, they are usually available from the autumn until the spring[K]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[16, 37, 200]. Prefers a heavy soil[16]. Prefers a soil that is not too rich[37]. Succeeds in any reasonable soil. Succeeds in maritime gardens[200]. The savoy cabbage is often grown for its edible leaves. This is a very hardy form of cabbage that is able to withstand quite severe winters, providing leaves from autumn to the spring. There are many named varieties. The savoy, however, is considered by many people to be coarser tasting than other cabbages and is less grown nowadays."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April/May. Plant out in summer as space permits. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported."
