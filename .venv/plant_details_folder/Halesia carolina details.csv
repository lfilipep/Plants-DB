23,Other Uses Description,"- soft, light, close-grained[82]. It weighs 35lb per cubic foot[235]. Trees occasionally grow large enough for saw timber and are then cut and used for panelling and cabinet making[229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny sheltered position and a deep moist sandy soil[1, 11]. Succeeds in most moist soils[184] and in most positions[11] so long as they are well-drained[202]. Requires a lime-free soil[200]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1, 11], it has a moderate rate of growth and lives about 100 years[229]. It can flower when only 1.2 metres tall[113]. The flowers have a delicate sweet perfume[245]. The sub-species H. tetraptera monticola forms a tree about 24 metres tall. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 113, 200]. It takes 18 months to germinate[113]. Warm stratifying the seed for 2 - 3 months at 14 - 25°c then cold stratifying for 2 - 3 months at 0 - 5°c can reduce the germination time. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame. Roots in 28 days. A fair percentage[78]. Layering in early spring as the buds break. Takes 12 months. High percentage[78]."
