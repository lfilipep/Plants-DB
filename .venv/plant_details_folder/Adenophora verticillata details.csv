Grows well in the semi-shade of shrubs or in light woodland[88]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance[1]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, they have been known to destroy even mature plants[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. Surface sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot in the spring in order to avoid transplanting[133]. We have found that if transplanted when very small seedlings grow away without difficulty[K]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 10°c[133]. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst young. Basal cuttings in spring[K]. Division in spring - very difficult because the plant dislikes root disturbance[1]..,
