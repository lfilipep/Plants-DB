24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. Plants are likely to prefer a rich moist soil with some shade in the summer. The crushed leaves smell strongly of celery[193]. The New Zealand form of this plant is now known as A. filiforme, (syn A. prostratum filiforme [q.v.]). The Australian form of this plant has been moved to A. prostratum and only the S. American form is left under this name[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Germination can take a month or longer. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring."
