Plants are hardy to about -15°c, though the stems are often cut back by hard frosts[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. In cultivation people often cut the plants to the ground in the spring in order to encourage strong new growth and plenty of flowers[190, 200, 233]. Plants rarely produce seed in Britain[200]. The crushed leaves are very aromatic[190]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of softwood in late spring in a frame[200]. Easy[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm long with a heel, July/August in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
