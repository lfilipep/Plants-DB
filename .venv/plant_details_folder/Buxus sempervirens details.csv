21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antiperiodic  Antirheumatic  Cathartic  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Epilepsy  Febrifuge  Homeopathy  Leprosy  Malaria  Narcotic  Odontalgic  Oxytoxic  Sedative  Tonic  VermifugeAlthough it has been used medicinally in the past as a sedative and to treat syphilis, box is very rarely used in modern herbalism[268]. The leaves and the bark are alterative, antirheumatic, cathartic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, febrifuge, oxytocic and vermifuge[4, 7, 9, 21, 178]. The leaves have been used as a quinine substitute in the treatment of malaria[7]. The leaves are harvested in the spring, before the plant comes into flower, and they are dried for later use[238]. The bark can be harvested at any time of the year and is dried for use in decoctions[238]. Use this remedy with caution and preferably only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner. The plant has not been fully tested for its toxic side effects[7, 21]. The wood is diaphoretic, in full dose it is narcotic and sedative, in overdose it is convulsant and emetico-cathartic[4]. A tincture of the wood has been used as a bitter tonic and antiperiodic, it has also had a reputation for curing leprosy[4]. A volatile oil distilled from the wood has been prescribed in cases of epilepsy[4]. An essential oil obtained from the plant is used in dentistry[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant[7]. It is extensively used in the treatment of rheumatism[7]."

23,Other Uses Description,"Box makes an excellent hedge from 45cm to 4.5 metres tall according to the variety grown[11, 29]. It is quite slow growing but very tolerant of cutting and is often used in topiary, where the hedge is trimmed into different forms for ornamental effect[182]. The leaves and sawdust, boiled in lye, have been used to dye hair an auburn colour[4].  - hard, close grained, heavy. Although the wood is rather small, it is highly valued on account of its hardness - it is twice as hard as oak (Quercus species)[4, 268]. It is used for engraving, printing blocks, bowls, combs etc[4, 7, 11, 46, 100, 115, 178]. The root especially is much liked by turners and cabinet makers[7]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Foundation, Screen, Woodland garden. Succeeds in almost any soil that is well-drained[11, 200], preferring light shade and chalky soils[9, 11, 28, 31]. Succeeds in dry shade[188]. Tolerates a pH range from 5.5 to 7.4[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -23°c, though it prefers milder winters[238]. A very polymorphic species, it is a very ornamental but slow growing plant[11] and there are many named varieties developed for their ornamental value[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. A good bee plant[108]. Plants are very tolerant of being trimmed, they can be cut right back to the base if required and will usually resprout freely[11, 29]. The foliage is pungently scented, especially when wet[245]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - stratification is not necessary but can lead to more regular germination[113]. The seed is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[138]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. It usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c but stored seed can take longer[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of short side shoots with a heel, September in a frame[200]. High percentage[78]. Rather slow to root[K]. Nodal cuttings in spring in a frame. Fairly easy[200]."
