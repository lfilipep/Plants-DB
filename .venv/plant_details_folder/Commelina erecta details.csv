24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light well-drained loam with added leafmold[1, 42]. Succeeds in an ordinary, reasonably moist soil in a sunny position with some shelter[164]. A polymorphic plant[200]. This species is not very winter hardy, the roots are best dug up in autumn and stored like dahlias in a cool frost free place and then planted out in spring[200]. When grown in a light well-drained soil and mulched well, the roots usually survive the winter outdoors[1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in 4 - 5 weeks at 20°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring. Make sure that each portion has at least one growing bud[111, K]. Cuttings during the growing season. Very easy[200].",
