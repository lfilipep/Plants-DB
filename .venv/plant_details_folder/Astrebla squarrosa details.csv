13,Summary,"Erect, shortly rhizomatous perennial, to 1.5 m high.  Astrebla is a small genus of xerophytic (requiring little liquid water) grasses found only in Australia. They are the dominant grass across much of the continent distributed in Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales. Sometimes misspelt as Astrebla aquamosa"
14,Physical Characteristics,"Astrebla squarrosa is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. Cultivated in the past but largely or completely abandoned.
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,Providing habitat for organisms such as mammals. Bull Mitchell grass is less palatable to livestock than other Mitchell grasses. It can withstand grazing and drought and produces an abundance of fodder.
24,Cultivation Details,"Historic Crop: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Historic Crop  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carbClimate: subtropical to tropical. Humidity: semi-arid. Grow on clay soils, mainly between an upper limit of 600 mm average annual rainfall, and a lower limit of 200 mm, and even below in depressions where the water concentrates following rains e.g. in Sturt's Stony Desert. Often seen growing to 1.5 metres tall on floodplains and heavy dark clay soils in arid to semi-arid Australia. The coarse stems and difficult digestibility make this a less desirable Mitchell grass for livestock. Mitchell grasses are deep-rooted and become dormant during drought, allowing them to survive extended periods without rainfall. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: historic crop. Cultivated in the past but largely or completely abandoned. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems used in cultivation) [1-1]."
