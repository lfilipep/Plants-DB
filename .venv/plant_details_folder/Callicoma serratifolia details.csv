This species tolerates temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers that often do not fully ripen new growth and our longer colder and wetter winters. One report says that it can tolerate temperatures down to about -5°c[260] and so it might succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of the country, though generally it requires cold greenhouse treatment in Britain[1].
