21,Other Uses Description,"A very good ground cover plant, rooting as it spreads[182] and succeeding under trees and shrubs as well as in full sun[190, 197]. Plants should be spaced about 1 metre apart each way[208]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in almost any soil in sun or shade but prefers a good moist soil in a sunny position[182]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190], they also succeed in dry shade[188]. Plants do not fruit so well when they are grown in the shade[200]. Tolerates salt-laden winds[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[184]. The plant is not usually eaten by deer[182]. Fruits are occasionally produced in Britain[182]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[200]. 'Moss Green' is especially recommended for ground cover[182]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn[200]."
