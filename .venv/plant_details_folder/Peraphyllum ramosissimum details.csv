18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[11]. Sour when unripe, the fruits are slightly bitter as they ripen and when fully ripe are sweetish but with a bitter after-taste[85, 183]. Those fruits that have fully ripened and dried on the plant are the sweetest and most desirable[85, 183]. Ripe fruits can also be used in making jellies or prepared like spiced crab apples[85, 183]. Fruits are rarely borne in Britain[11, 200].",

26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise as soon as stored seed is received. Stored seed is likely to require a period of cold stratification. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter, planting out in late spring. Layering in spring. Takes 12 months[78].",
