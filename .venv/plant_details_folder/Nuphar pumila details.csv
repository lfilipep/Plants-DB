These uses are listed below. Root - cooked[2, 46, 61, 177, 183]. An edible starch can be extracted from the root[183]. A possible emergency food[61]. The root has a bitter flavour - this bitterness can be removed by leaching the root in water[K]. Leaves and leaf stalks - cooked[2, 177, 183]. Seed - cooked[105]. It can be ground into a powder and used in making bread and porridge, or for thickening soups etc[207]. The seed can also be parched, when it swells considerably but does not burst like popcorn[183]. It is then normally eaten dry[207]. A refreshing drink is made from the flowers[2, 183]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,A water plant requiring a sunny position[1]. Succeeds in very poor acid waters in the wild[56]. It is best if grown in still water at least 30cm deep[56] but it also tolerates slow moving water[200]. Succeeds in light shade[200]. This species is closely related to N. lutea[200].
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse in pots submerged under 25mm of water. Prick out into individual pots as soon as the first true leaf appears and grow them on in water in a greenhouse for at least two years before planting them out in late spring. The seed is collected by wrapping the developing seed head in a muslin bag to avoid the seed being lost. Harvest it 10 days after it sinks below the soil surface or as soon as it reappears[200]. Division in May. Each portion must have at least one eye. Submerge in pots in shallow water until established[56].
