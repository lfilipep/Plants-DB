4,Known Hazards,"The plant is poisonous[19]. This report probably refers to the presence of calcium oxylate in all parts of the plant. This substance is toxic and if consumed makes the mouth and digestive tract feel as though hundreds of needles are being stuck into it. However, calcium oxylate is easily destroyed by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant[172]. Itching and inflammation possible with root contact. Fresh plant can cause blisters. Avoid during pregnancy and breast feeding. Avoid with kidney stones [301]."

Traditionally the root was dried for at least 5 weeks or boiled for 3 days before being eaten[159]. Young leaves - cooked[105, 106, 161]. A peppery flavour[159].

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Epilepsy  Expectorant  Narcotic  OdontalgicSkunk cabbage was much used by the native North American Indians primarily for its expectorant and antispasmodic properties to treat bronchitis and asthmatic conditions, a use that is still employed in modern herbalism[254]. The plant should be used with some caution, however, and preferably under professional supervision. Handling the fresh leaves can cause skin to blister whilst excessive doses of the root can bring on nausea and vomiting, headaches and dizziness[238, 254]. The root is antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant and slightly narcotic[4, 21, 46, 165, 222, 238]. The rootstock is harvested in late autumn or early spring and dried for later use[238]. It should not be stored for a long time because it loses its medicinal virtues[213]. The rootstock has been used internally in the treatment of respiratory and nervous disorders, including asthma, whooping cough, catarrh, bronchitis and hay fever[213, 238]. It is occasionally used to treat epilepsy, headaches, vertigo and rheumatic problems[254]. Externally, it has been used as a poultice to draw splinters and thorns, to heal wounds and to treat headaches[254]. The root hairs or rootlets have been applied to dental cavities to treat toothache[213]. A tea made from the root hairs has been used externally to stop bleeding[213]. An inhalation of the crushed leaves has been used in the treatment of headaches[238]. The leaf bases have been applied as a wet dressing to bruises[213]."
22,Other Uses,Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.
23,Other Uses Description,An infusion of the powdered root has been used as a wash to 'cure a strong smell under your arm'[257].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in sun or shade in a deep moist to wet lime-free soil that is rich in organic matter[200]. Grows well in a bog garden or along the wet banks of streams and ponds[1, 238]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -35°c[238]. All parts of the pant, but especially the flowers, have a strong unpleasant aroma[4, 187] that is said to be a combination of skunk, carrion and garlic[245]. The plant can raise the temperature of its inflorescence by 15 - 35°c above the ambient air temperature, thus protecting itself from frost and helping to attract pollinating insects[200, 238]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. The seed should be stored in water if it is not sown immediately[238]. Stored seed can be sown in late winter or early spring. Stand the pot in 2cm of water to keep the compost wet. Germination should take place in the spring, prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in wet soil in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring once they are large enough. Division with great care whilst the plant is dormant[200]."
