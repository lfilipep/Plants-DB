Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. Many kinds of insects are attracted to the flowers, especially short-tongued bees, wasps, flies, and beetles. The caterpillars of the butterfly Papilio polyxenes asterias (Black Swallowtail) feed on the foliage and flowers. This plant is not known to be toxic, and it is probably consumed occasionally by various mammalian herbivores, although information about this is limited [1-6].",,"Prefers full or partial sun and mesic (environment or habitat containing a moderate amount of moisture) conditions. The soil can contain significant amounts of loam, sand, or rocky material. Light shade is tolerated, but growth will be less robust and flowering less abundant. Hairy-Jointed Meadow Parsnip develops rapidly during the spring, and is usually taller than the surrounding plants when the blooming period begins. After flowering, the condition of the plant rapidly deteriorates [1-6]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
