25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Cascades, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen. Thrives in a reasonably moist but well-drained soil in sun or part shade[1, 11, 182]. Hardy to at least -20°c[200]. There some named varieties[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but it is likely to require a period of cold stratification and would probably be best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as soon as it is received. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring is a very effective means of increase[78]. Roots cuttings, March in a warm greenhouse[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 12cm long, July in a frame. High percentage[78]."
