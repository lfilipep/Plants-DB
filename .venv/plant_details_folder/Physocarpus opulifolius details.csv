24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we do not have any information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe if possible in a cold frame. If sown in the spring it is likely to require a period of cold stratification. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Cuttings of greenwood, June in a closed frame[200].",
