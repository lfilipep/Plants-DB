Found especially on forested slopes[422 ].","Northern S.

It has a roundish crown and a straight, cylindrical, not buttressed trunk that can be up to 90 cm in diameter. It is commonly grown throughout northern South America and currently threatened by overexploitation. Medicinally, the plant is used for body aches, malaria, and fevers. No plant part is edible. The wood is hard, heavy, dense, and highly durable, and suitable for high class furniture, cabinet making, turnery, flooring, wheelwright?s work, beams, general construction, joinery, panelling, etc.","Vouacapoua americana is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Andira aubletii Benth.,,None known,"Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  MalariaA decoction of the wood is used as a wash for body aches caused by overwork[348 ]. A decoction of the bark is drunk to treat malaria[348 ]. A decoction of the leaves is used as a wash for fevers[348 ].,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses The heartwood is dark olive to dark chocolate; it is clearly demarcated from the 18 - 30mm wide, cream-coloured sapwood. Numerous fine lines of parenchyma, which are initially lighter brown in colour but which eventually turn nearly black, make the wood unusually attractive. The texture is uniformly coarse; the grain straight to slightly roey; the lustre low; no distinctive odour or taste is present in seasoned wood. The wood is hard, heavy, dense and very durable in contact with the soil, being highly resistant to decay and insect attack. There are conflicting reports regarding its resistance to toredo attack in sea water, though it is generally considered fairly resistant. It is somewhat slow to season, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It has a fairly high blunting effect, so stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; despite its high density, however, the wood is only moderately difficult to work and is generally said to have good working qualities; smooth surfaces are obtained in sawing and planing, but the coarse grain causes some rough and torn grain in boring and mortising; nailing and screwing are good so long as holes are pre-bored; gluing is correct for interior purposes only. The wood is used for making high class furniture, cabinet making, turnery, flooring, wheelwright's work, beams, general construction, joinery, panelling, railway crossties, posts, rising and gunwales of boats, and general construction[378 , 848 ].",,"A plant of low elevations in the moist tropics. Succeeds in full sun to dappled shade[420 ]. Found in the wild mainly on moist, clay soils[420 ]. Newly planted young trees grow away quite quickly and can reach 2 metres or more within 2 years[420 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[755 ].","Seed - it normally germinates within 1 - 2 weeks of falling from the tree so needs to be sown as soon as it is harvested. Sow the seed in individual containers in a semi-shaded position, A germination rate in excess of 80% can be expected within 1 - 2 weeks[420 ]. Plants should be ready to plant into their permanent positions 4 - 5 months later[420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
