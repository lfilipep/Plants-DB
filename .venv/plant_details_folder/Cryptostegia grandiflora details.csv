21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant can be pruned and grown as a hedge[302 ]. Other Uses: A latex obtained from the stems can be used to make rubber[302 ]. It is equal in quality to the latex obtained from the rubber tree, Hevea sp.[200 ]. Very difficult to obtain by tapping[458 ]. A reasonably high-quality rubber is obtained from the latex[457 , 458 ]. A fibre is obtained from the stems[302 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
