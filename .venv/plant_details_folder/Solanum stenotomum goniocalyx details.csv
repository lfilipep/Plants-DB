Prefers a slightly acid soil, the tubers are subject to scab on limy soils or those deficient in humus. Yields best on a fertile soil rich in organic matter. This plant is one of the S. American species of potatoes. It is not frost hardy but can probably be grown in much the same way as potatoes are grown by planting out the tubers in spring and harvesting in the autumn[K]. It is occasionally cultivated in the Andes, some strains are fairly frost-resistant[196]. Plants might have strict daylength requirements and may yield poorly in temperate zones because they need short-days in order to induce tuber-formation[196]. A diploid species producing fertile seed, it is considered to be the most ancient of the cultivated potatoes[196]. Tubers require a dormant period before they will resprout and can be stored for 3 - 4 months[196].",Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into a fairly rich compost as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on fast. Plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division. Harvest the tubers in autumn after the top-growth has been cut back by frost. Store the tubers in a cool frost-free place overwinter and replant in April.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
