See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from October to January. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedgerow;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",,"Young shoots - cooked and used like hop shoots (Humulus lupulus)[7, 46, 61].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Bach  Diuretic  Homeopathy  Rubefacient  SkinThe leaves are analgesic, diuretic and rubefacient[7, 61]. The boiled roots and stems are used as a cure for the itch[4]. When applied in the nostrils, the plant juice has been used to relieve migraine attacks, but it can also destroy the mucous membranes[7]. The plant should not be taken internally because it is poisonous[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the plant. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism and skin eruptions[238]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Indifference', 'Dreaminess', 'Inattention' and 'Unconsciousness'[209]. It is also one of the five ingredients in the 'Rescue remedy'[209].",Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs.

Dislikes poorly-drained heavy clay soils, but grows well in clay if grit is added for drainage[11, 200]. Dislikes light sandy soils[11]. Does well on chalk[1]. Dislikes acid soils below a pH of 6.0[186]. Succeeds in acid as well as alkaline soils[200]. Plants are hardy to about -18°c[202]. A twining plant[182]. The leafstalks wrap themselves around twigs and branches for support. When a side of the stalk touches an object, the growth on that side slows down whilst the other side grows at its normal rate - this causes the leaf stalk to entwine the object it is touching[186, 212]. It is capable of growing 2 metres in a year and can easily smother small trees and shrubs[186]. Another report says that it can grow 5 metres in a year[202]. When planting out, in order to avoid the disease 'clematis wilt', it is best to plant the rootball about 8cm deeper in the soil. This will also serve to build up a good root crown of growth buds[200]. The flowers are almond-scented[202]. They are produced on the current season's growth[219]. The plant is very amenable to pruning and can be cut back severely if required. This is best done in early spring[202]. A greedy plant, inhibiting growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[164, 200]. Sow stored seed as soon as it is obtained in a cold frame. Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and remove as much of the tail and outer coat as possible[164]. A period of cold stratification is beneficial[164]. The seed germinates in 1 - 9 months or more at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, taken between nodes, July/August in a frame[1]. Internodal cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, late spring in sandy soil in a frame. Layering of old stems in late winter or early spring[200]. Layering of current seasons growth in early summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
