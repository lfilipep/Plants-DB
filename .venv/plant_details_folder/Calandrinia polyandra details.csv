4,Known Hazards,"The plant contains oxalic acid, so it should only be used in moderation[144]. Oxalic acid can lock up certain of the nutrients in food and, if eaten in excess, can lead to nutritional deficiencies. It is, however, perfectly safe in small amounts and its acid taste adds a nice flavour to salads. Cooking the plant will reduce the quantity of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."
5,Habitats,"Arid areas[157], often around salt lakes. Floodplains and stony plains in andy and loamy soils in Western Australia[285]."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw. The leaves contain oxalic acid and so some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Seed - raw or ground into a meal[144]. The seed is very small and fiddly to harvest, especially since it ripens intermittently over a period of several weeks[K]. Root - raw or cooked[144]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a hot sunny situation on a poor dry sandy soil[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, but it should be possible to grow it as a tender annual in this country. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance, they are best treated as half-hardy annuals and sown in situ in late spring[1]. In frosty climates this species can become a self-sowing annual, the seed germinating in spring[157]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in situ in spring since it strongly resents root disturbance. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 weeks at 20°c[138].
