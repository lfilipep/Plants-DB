Main Bloom Time: Late summer. Form: Rounded.,"Saxifraga stolonifera is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 0.3 m (1ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",S. sarmentosa.,Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antiphlogistic  Depurative  FebrifugeAntibacterial, antiphlogistic[174]. There are growth-promoting substances in the leaves[174]. The whole plant is depurative, febrifuge and suppurative[147, 218]. Its use promotes the drainage of pus[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of boils and abscesses, poisonous snakebites, otitis media, acute attacks of convulsions and haematemesis[147]. The leaf juice is applied to aching ears, abscesses and inflammations[218].",,Can be grown as a ground cover plant in a shady position[188]. Plants should be spaced about 45cm apart each way[208].,,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a cool position in a moist humus-rich soil[1]. Prefers an acid soil[200]. Thrives on heavy soils in the milder areas of the country[208]. Usually thrives in a poor soil with a northerly aspect[1]. Grows well in light woodland[200] or in a shady position in a rock garden. The plant is hardy to about -10°c[187]. The leaves and the flowers, however, are liable to be damaged by autumn frosts[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is sometimes grown as a house plant[200]. A polymorphic species[1], it is closely related to S. cortusifolia, differing in having runners[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)

Forming a dense prostrate carpet spreading indefinitely [1-2].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. Surface sow, or only just cover the seed, and make sure that the compost does not dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
