See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies, midges. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

They are also used in making twig bridges in the Himalayas[145].",,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a good soil but also does well in poor soils[1, 11, 200]. It thrives in lime and is also happy in peaty soils[1]. It succeeds in any soil that is not marshy or waterlogged[11, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils[188]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade but does not fruit so freely in a shady position[11, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The flowers, when inhaled near to, have an unpleasant smell like decaying fish[245]. They are very attractive to bees whilst the fruit is a good winter food source for many species of birds[200]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed. Members of this genus hybridize freely so, if you require seed that breeds true, it is important to obtain it from a known wild source or from a controlled fertilization of garden plants. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it will usually germinate in the spring[11, 200]. Stored seed germinates faster if given 3 months warm stratification at 15°c and then 3 months cold stratification at 4°c[164]. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 18 months at 15°c but it can take 2 years[164]. Pot the seedlings up as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into nursery beds or into their permanent positions when they are more than 10cm tall.
