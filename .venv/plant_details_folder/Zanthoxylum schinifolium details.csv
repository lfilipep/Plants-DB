21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anaesthetic  Diuretic  Parasiticide  Stimulant  Tonic  VasodilatorThe pericarp is anaesthetic, diuretic, parasiticide and vasodilator[176]. It is used in the treatment of gastralgia and dyspepsia due to cold with vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, ascariasis and dermal diseases[176]. It has a local anaesthetic action and is parasiticide against the pork tapeworm (Taenia solium)[176]. The pericarp contains geraniol. In small doses this has a mild diuretic action, though large doses will inhibit the excretion of urine[176]. There is a persistent increase in peristalsis at low concentration, but inhibition at high concentration[176]. The resin contained in the bark, and especially in that of the roots, is powerfully stimulant and tonic[82]."
22,Other Uses,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Uses: Clearstem tree, multi-stem tree, specimen tree, specimen shrub; Parks, tree containers, cemeteries, roof gardens, large gardens.  Prefers a good deep well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Flowers are formed on the old wood[206]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Self-sown seedlings have occasionally been observed growing in bare soil in the shade of the parent plant[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Stored seed may requires up to 3 months cold stratification, though scarification may also help[113]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. Germination should take place in late spring, though it might take another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Root cuttings, 3cm long, planted horizontally in pots in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78]. Suckers, removed in late winter and planted into their permanent positions[113]."
