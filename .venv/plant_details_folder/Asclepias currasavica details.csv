18,Medicinal Uses,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DysenteryThe latex of the plant as well as the roots, leaves, and flowers are used medicinally[317 ]. The root is febrifuge. A decoction is used in the treatment of dysentery and as an eyewash for infected eyes[348 ]. The root contains a glycoside, asclepiadin, which is used as an emetic and purgative[332 , 348 ]. It has been used as a substitute for ipecacuanha[332 ]. A paste made of the crushed leaves, combined with salt, vegetable oil and bread, is used for treating skin ulcers[348 ]. The plant contains an abundant white latex which is applied to warts and corns in order to kill them[332 ]. The juice of the whole plant is used to treat ringworm, sores, rashes, dermatitis etc[348 ]. The plant is considered cicatrizant (healing cuts etc by encouraging the formation of scars)[332 ]. The aerial parts of plant are sometimes used in the treatment of dysentery and as an eyewash for infected eyes[348 ]. The root contains cardenolides with aglycones such as asclepogenine and curassavogenine[348 ]. The latex contains cardenolides and esterified triterpenes. Extracts stimulate the central nervous system[348 ]. The latex also contains quercetin, caffeic acid, sterols, flavonoids, carbohydrates, fatty acids and acidic mucilage[348 ]. The plant contains beta-sitosterol, which is antihypercholesterolemic (reduces cholesterol), anti-prostatic, and oestrogenic[348 ].",
20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"The stem fibres are used for spinning, partly in mixture with cotton[317 , 332 ]. The seed hairs are used as a stuffing material for pillows[317 , 332 ]. This is too elastic for spinning unless altered by chemical treatment after which it can be spun admixed with cotton[332 ]. The stems are used, tied in bundles, as brooms[332 ]. The dogbane-milkweed family Asclepias, Apocynum, Calotropis, and Trachomitum spp) has been used for fiber industrial crops for millennia with a number in cultivation as regional crops. All of these crops are dual-purpose fibres, offering bast fibres from the stem and seed finer or ‘floss’ in the fruit pods. Many have also been identified as potential hydrocarbon crops due to high latex content. Could be integrated into various agroforestry systems rather than as monocultures [1-1].",
22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Hay  Regional CropSucceeds in a range of climates from warm temperate to tropical. Requires a well-drained soil and a sunny position[200 ]. Succeeds on a wide range of soils[305 ]. The plant has very light, plumed seeds that can be carried considerable distances in the wind. It has often escaped from cultivation and has become a weed throughout the tropics[200 , 305 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - surface sow and make sure the seeds are kept moist[200 ].,
