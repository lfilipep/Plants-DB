0,Latin Name,Astragalus crassicarpus
1,Common Name,"Ground Plum, Groundplum milkvetch"
2,Family,Fabaceae or Leguminosae
3,USDA hardiness,6-9
4,Known Hazards,Many members of this genus contain toxic glycosides[65]. All species with edible seedpods can be distinguished by their fleshy round or oval seedpod that looks somewhat like a greengage[85]. A number of species can also accumulate toxic levels of selenium when grown in soils that are relatively rich in that element[65].
5,Habitats,Prairies and plains[60].
6,Range,Western N. America - Eastern Rocky mountains and eastward to Nebraska.

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Astragalus crassicarpus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil."
15,Synonyms,A. caryocarpus. Ker-Gawl. A. mexicanus. A. succulentus. Geoprumnon succulentum.
16,Plant Habitats,Cultivated Beds;
17,Edible Parts,"Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The thick fleshy unripe seedpods, which resemble green plums, are eaten raw or cooked[2, 177, 183]. They are highly esteemed[85]. The pods are about 25mm in diameter[235]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Haemostatic  StimulantA compound decoction or infusion of the root has been used to treat fits and convulsions and has been used on bleeding wounds[257]. It has also been taken or used externally as a stimulant[257].
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,Nitrogen Fixer. Provides shelter for beneficial invertebrates: insects and other arthropods. A general nectary plant [1-2].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a dry well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and are best planted in their final positions whilst still small[200]. The stems are sometimes prostrate[200]. This species is somewhat polymorphic and is separated into a number of distinct species by some botanists[235]. The form sometimes known as A. mexicanus has larger seedpods than the type, up to 35mm in diameter[235]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Many members of this genus can be difficult to grow, this may be due partly to a lack of their specific bacterial associations in the soil[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate[200]. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed[134, 200]. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours[134, 200]. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh[134]. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
