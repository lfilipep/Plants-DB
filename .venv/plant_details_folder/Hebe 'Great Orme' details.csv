22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a position in full sun, succeeding in most well-drained soils with some shelter from cold winds[200]. Dislikes very dry soils and water-logged soils, but is somewhat drought tolerant when established[190]. Tolerant of atmospheric pollution and maritime exposure[200]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c. They grow well in a dry border in an Essex garden[190]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Tolerant of pruning, plants can be cut back into old wood if required[188]. Closely related to H. 'Carnea'[200]. This species is very easy to transplant and, with care, it can even be moved when in flower. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a 'clumping' habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half ripe wood, 3 - 5cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn or winter in a frame."
