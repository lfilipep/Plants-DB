Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755]. Can be grown as an annual in colder areas.","Seed - sow in situ in spring. An autumn sowing in situ might also succeed. The seed has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
