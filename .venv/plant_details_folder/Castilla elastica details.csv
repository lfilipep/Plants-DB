22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Design: Specimen tree. Botanic collection. Public open space. Agroforestry Uses: Members of this genus have a root system that consists of a rather short tap root and of several lateral roots spreading horizontally and so near the surface of the soil that they can often be followed for 20 to 30 metres[684 ]. This root system makes it difficult to grow other crops under the tree[K ]. Other Uses A good quality latex can be tapped from the trunk[46 , 307 ]. Produced copiously, trees 8 - 10 years old can yield up to 25kg of latex a year[307 ]. Once harvested, the rubbery latex dries to become tough and resilient[307 ]. The latex can be used commercially, and is also much used by local people who made items such as bouncing balls, waterproofing fabrics, artefacts etc[307 ]. The latex is often tinted with natural dyes and used to make local handcrafts[307 ]. The pale grey bark is fibrous. It strips off the trunk easily and is used to make cord[307 ]. The bark is beaten to make into mats, blankets and clothing[46 , 307 , 447 , 454 ]. The wood is yellow brown, moderately soft, light in weight, and not durable. It is used chiefly for fuel[447 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the moist, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 30c, but can tolerate 15 - 34c[418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 10c or lower[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,300 - 2,700mm, but tolerates 2,000 - 3,000mm[418 ]. Grows best in a rich, well-drained soil in a sunny position[307 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 7[418 ]. Tapping of the trees for their latex can commence 7 years after planting[418 ]. Plants have become invasive in some areas[307 ]. A fast growing tree[447 ]. Individual plants can either produce only male flowers (dioecious) or they can produce both male and female flowers (monoecious)[315 , 684 ]. Trees at 8-10 years old can yield 25kg (55lb) of latex (poor quality).",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe because it has a short viability[307 ].,
