20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"A good ground cover with medium to high density growing at a fast rate. Plants will spread in the garden by rhizomes and self-seeding to form a dense ground cover, sometimes to the point of being considered aggressive [368-1]. Ornamental: Long summer bloom and airy foliage provide good accent in borders or rock gardens. Good small area ground cover. Also effective as an edger for borders, foundations and walks/paths. Naturalized areas, native plant gardens or cottage gardens [368-1]. Wildlife Food: Attracts birds that eat the seeds. Insectory: Provides for food for pollinators [1-2].  A good cut flower."

Salt: Moderate [318-1]. Bloom Time: Early Summer - Early Fall. Fruit Time: Summer - Fall. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Sow seeds at 55° to 61°F in mid- or late winter, or divide plants in early spring. Basal cuttings can be rooted in spring."
