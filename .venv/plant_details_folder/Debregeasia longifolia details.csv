Plants tolerate occasional lows to about -5°c[260]. This species is probably not very hardy in Britain and will probably require greenhouse protection, though it might be possible to grow it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country, especially if it is given the protection of a warm wall. A very variable species[266]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed and fruit is required.","Seed - sow late winter to mid-summer in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 2 months at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings in early summer[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
