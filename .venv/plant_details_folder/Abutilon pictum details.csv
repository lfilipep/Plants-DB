22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Hedge, Specimen. Requires a sunny position or part day shade in a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. This species is only hardy in the very mildest areas of Britain, being intolerant of temperatures that fall much below 0°c[260]. Plants are often deciduous in cold winters[219]. A deep mulch in winter and tying in growth to the wall will maximise protection in winter[200]. If the plant is cut back by cold weather, it can resprout from the base in the spring and can flower on the current year's growth[202]. A very ornamental plant, there are several named varieties[200]. Several of the cultivars have golden-variegated leaves caused by a virus infection, this infection can spread to other plants[260]. Tip-prune young plants to promote a bushy habit[200]. Older plants tend to get rather leggy, but can be cut back almost to the base in order to promote new growth. This is best done in late winter as the plant starts to come into growth[260]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Germination should take place within a few weeks. Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow them on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of young shoots, June in a frame[200]. Grow on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Grow on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in spring after the last expected frosts."
