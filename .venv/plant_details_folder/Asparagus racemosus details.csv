24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any good garden soil[200]. Prefers a rich sandy loam[1]. This species is not very frost-hardy and generally needs to be grown in a frost-free or fairly frost-free climate[200, 238]. It can be grown as a half-hardy perennial in areas where the winter is too cold for it to survive outdoors. The tubers are harvested in the autumn, stored in a cool frost-free place and replanted in the spring[238]. The rots of this species are commonly collected from the wild for medicinal use. Overcollection in some areas of its range are causing conservation concerns[272]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring or as soon as the seed is ripe in early autumn in a greenhouse. It usually germinates in 3 - 6 weeks at 25°c[134]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Division in early spring as the plant comes into growth.
