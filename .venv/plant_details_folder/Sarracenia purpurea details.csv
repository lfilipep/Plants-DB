23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Specimen, Woodland garden. Grow in sun or partial shade in peat or moss[188]. Requires a moist but well-drained position[4]. Plants require continuously moist conditions in a loose compost of sphagnum peat, live sphagnum and coarse acid sand[260]. They can be grown successfully in a plastic basin or in a pot that is standing in a deep saucer of water[260]. An insectivorous plant[61], it is best grown in a boggy position[1] in a soil that is low in nitrogen. The leaves form cups which become filled with water in which insects become trapped, drown and are digested by the plant[4]. A very ornamental and polymorphic plant[200], it is becoming very rare in the wild and is on the CITES II list of endangered species. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but would suggest sowing the seed in light shade in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if possible otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Division might be possible."
