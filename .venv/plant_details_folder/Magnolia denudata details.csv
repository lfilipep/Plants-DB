Best grown in a warm position in a moderately rich free soil of an open texture[1]. Succeeds in an acid or neutral peaty soil in sun or part shade[184]. Tolerates alkaline soils so long as they are deep and rich in humus[188]. The branches are brittle so a sheltered position is required[200]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], it is hardy to about -20°c when dormant[184] but plants can be excited into early growth by mild winters and the flowers are then liable to be killed by frost[11]. The flowers, which begin to be produced when the plant is quite young, are deliciously scented[245]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
