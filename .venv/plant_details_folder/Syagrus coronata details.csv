16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,"Apical bud: Typically, the end of a shoot contains an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs.,Oil: Oil,Oil: "
19,Edible Uses Description,"01 , 416 ]. The pulp of the fruit is eaten by local peoples[301 ]. Fibrous, with a slightly sweet flavour[416 ]. The fruit is about 26mm long x 20mm wide[200 ]. Leaves - cooked[768 ]. The apical bud, often known as a 'palm heart', is eaten as a vegetable[768 ]. Eating this bud leads to the death of the tree because it is unable to make side shoots[K ]. The seed is sometimes eaten[63 , 416 , 419 ]. A non-drying oil is obtained from the seed[46 , 301 ]. It is used to make margarine[46 , 301 ]. The pith of the stem is used to make bread[301 ]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The oil from the seeds is useful for treating wounds caused by stingrays[739 ].
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant is seen as an indicator of fertile soils in the wild[419 ]. Other Uses: A wax, known as 'licuri wax' is obtained by scraping the leaves[419 ]. It is used for making torches[768 ]. An oil obtained from the seed is used for making soap[768 ]. The dried leaves are used for making dusters, hats, brooms etc[419 ]. The seeds are used in making rosaries[419 ]. The wood is moderately heavy, hard, of low durability when exposed to the elements[419 ]. It is only used locally for building construction[419 ]. An important role in the diets of tropical seasonally dry forest animals. Grown as an ornamental."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Wax: Water resistant, malleable substances. Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil)."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Wax  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant for the humid tropics and subtropics, growing naturally in areas of seasonal rainfall[200 ]. Easily grown in a sunny position[314 ]. Succeeds even in calcareous soils[314 ]. Found mainly in very fertile soils, even if they are dry and gravelly[419 ]. A very slow-growing tree[419 ]. Plants can flower through most of the year[419 ]. Probably one of the more drought and wind tolerant Syagrus species and one of the few prone to rot if overwatered."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a deeply shaded position in a nursery seedbed. Germination can be very slow and can take 12 months[419 ]. When the seedlings are 8 - 12cm tall, pot them up into individual containers. They grow away slowly and can take a year or more before they are ready to plant out[419 ]."
