13,Summary,"Thaumatococcus daniellii, otherwise known as Sweet Prayer Plant, is native to western part of Africa, from Sierra Leone to Zaire. It is a large flowering herb with rhizomatous rootstock, growing about 4 m in height. It is a natural source of thaumatin, a low-calorie sweetener and flavor modifier protein. The leaves are ovateelliptic, large, and papery. The flowers are purple which occur singly or in branched spikes. The fruits are covered in a fleshy red aril, trigonal in shape and dark red/brown when fully ripe. Each fruit contains three black, hard seeds which can be eaten raw or cooked. It can also be used as sweetener. The leaves, on the other hand, are used for wrapping foods and for boiling foods. Petiole is used as weaving materials for mats and as tools and building materials. Leaves area also used for roofing. T. daniellii is also used in traditional medicine as a laxative (fruits), as an emetic and for pulmonary conditions (seeds), as antidote against venoms, stings, and bites (leaf sap), and as sedative and for insanity treatment (leaf and root sap)."

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked. A very sweet flavour[301 ]. When the raw seed is chewed, it affects the taste buds so that, for about an hour thereafter, any sour foods that are eaten or drunk seem to have a sweet flavour[301 ]. The seeds are also used for sweetening bread, fruits, tea etc[301 ]. The aril of the seed contains a sweet-tasting protein (thaumatin) that can be used as a substitute for sugar, also in low caloric diets and drinks[310 ]. Because of the persistent sweet aftertaste, it also 'sweetens' normally bitter or sour substances[310 ]. Thaumatin is the sweetest of known natural and synthetic substances, 2,000 - 3,000 times sweeter than sucrose[310 ]. The leaves are used for wrapping food[418 ]. The report does not make it clear if the leaves are used to impart a flavour when cooking, or are merely used to wrap the food when it is stored[K ]."
