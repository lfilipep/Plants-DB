Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Poultice  SalveThe root is analgesic[257]. It is used as a poultice or salve in the treatment of toothaches, boils, swellings, wounds and ulcers[222, 257]. As I was typing this report (29/01/95), Geoffrey Smith on Radio 4's 'Gardeners Question Time' spoke about it and said that it was the best poultice for boils that he knew of[K]. An infusion of the root has been used to treat backaches and, mixed with oil, has been used as a salve on sore muscles[257]. A tea made from the roots is used as a wash in the treatment of rheumatic pains[222].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Container, Foundation, Specimen, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant, it requires a cool moist shady position and a light sandy soil[1, 42, 111]. Likes plenty of humus in the soil[111]. Grows well in a woodland garden and in the rock garden[200]. Plants grow much taller in rich soils and then succeed in the herbaceous border[222]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c[187]. A very ornamental species, there are some named varieties[233].  Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the summer[200]. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division after the plants die down in late summer. It is best carried out in early spring before the plants flower[188]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
