See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,None known,"Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  TonicThe leaves are intensely bitter and are used as an antiperiodic and tonic[4]. They can be used as a quinine substitute[4].,,None known,,"Prefers a sunny position succeeding in most well-drained fertile soils[182, 200, 202]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in light shade[202], the plants are also tolerant of quite deep shade[219]. Does not require a rich soil or abundant moisture[11], if the soil is too fertile the flowering will be delayed[200]. Resistant to urban pollution and maritime exposure but are subject to wind scorch from cold drying winds in colder areas[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[184], it is best on a sunny wall in most parts of the country but does very well as a free standing shrub in Devon and Cornwall[11]. In cold winters and springs the previous year's leaves may fall before the new leaves are produced[202]. The plant strongly resents root disturbance[1, 11] and should be placed in its permanent position as soon as possible. The plant flowers on wood produced the previous summer[200]. All pruning should be carried out in spring before new growth starts but after flowering has ended[1]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Very slow, the seed can take 2 or more years to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10cm with a heel, August in a frame[200]. Cuttings of mature wood 10 - 12 cm with a heel, December/January in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
