See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedgerow;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 5, 37, 52]. Excellent raw, the leaves have a delicious sweet aniseed flavour[9] and are liked by the majority of people who try them[K]. They are also used as a flavouring for vegetables[183], and are an important ingredient of the herb mix 'bouquet garni'[244]. They can be cooked with tart fruits in order to reduce their acidity[14. 183]. The plant produces fresh leaves from late winter to early the following winter[200]. The leaves can also be dried for later use[21]. It is best to prevent the plant from flowering if the leaves are required for culinary use, because they lose their flavour when the plant is in flower[244]. Root - raw or cooked[1, 2, 5, 14, 37]. A similar flavour to the leaves[K]. So long as it is not too old, the root can be boiled and mixed with other vegetables or added to salads[9]. Seed - raw or cooked[1, 2, 183]. An aniseed flavour, it is usually used as a flavouring[14, 115] but can also be eaten raw whilst it is still green and before the fibrous coat has formed[1, 9]. It makes an excellent mouth freshener[K]. A tea is made from the leaves[183].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Aromatic  Carminative  Expectorant  StomachicThe whole plant, including the seed, is aromatic, carminative, expectorant and stomachic[4]. It is useful in the treatment of coughs and flatulence, and also as a gentle stimulant for the stomach[4, 238]. The root is antiseptic and a decoction has been used to treat snake and dog bites[4, 244]. An ointment made from the roots has been used to ease gout and soothe wounds[244].","Polish: Plants used to give a shine to metals, wood etc.","The leaves and the seed make good polishes for wood[4, 6, 115]. You just rub them over the wood and then rub the wood with a clean cloth to remove any greenness. It is particularly good on oak panels[5], giving a lovely glossy finish and an aromatic smell[244]. Invertabrate shelter, Nectary. Aromatic.",,"Prefers a moist rich soil in a shady position[14, 52, 200]. Thrives in all soils[1] in sun or shade[111, 200]. This species is hardy to about -15°c according to one report[200] whilst another says that it is hardy to at least -20°c[187]. Plants often self-sow freely[200]. Sweet cicely used to be quite widely cultivated as a food plant but is now only occasionally grown in the herb garden. This is a shame since it is an extremely useful and tasty plant to grow and can provide food all year round[K]. A good bee plant[4]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe since stored seed is difficult to germinate[1]. The seed can be sown in an outdoor seedbed or, if supplies are limited, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. Thin the seedlings in the outdoor bed as necessary (eat the thinnings) and transplant the young plants into their final positions in the following spring. Prick out the pot-grown seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in spring. Division in spring or autumn. Remove the tapering tap root and cut the remaining root into sections with at least one eye per section and replant in their permanent position.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
