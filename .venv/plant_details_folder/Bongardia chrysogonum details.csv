Strongly dislikes wet conditions[1]. Plants must have hot, dry conditions during their summer dormancy and must not be allowed to become too wet in winter, therefore they are best grown in a bulb frame[90, 130, 200]. Plants can be very long lived[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the greenhouse[200], putting about 3 -4 seeds in each pot. Use deep pots since the seedlings produce a contractile root that can pull themselves down to a depth of 15 - 30cm before sending up their first leaf[130]. The seed germinates in autumn and the first leaf appears in the spring[130]. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for at least 3 years before planting them out. Division is sometimes suggested as a means of increase, but is not possible for this species[130].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
