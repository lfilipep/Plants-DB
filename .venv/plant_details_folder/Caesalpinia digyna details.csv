(Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou)[1-3].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Pod  Industrial Crop: Oil  Industrial Crop: Starch  Industrial Crop: Tannin  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilSucceeds in warm temperate to tropical climates[310 ]. Succeeds in any moderately fertile, well-drained soil[200 ]. Requires a position in full sun[200 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 12 - 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until large enough to plant out. Softwood cuttings in sand in a frame[200 ].",
