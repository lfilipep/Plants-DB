Succeeds in any moderately fertile, well-drained soil[200 ]. Requires a position in full sun[200 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].","Seed - pre-soak for 12 - 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing.
