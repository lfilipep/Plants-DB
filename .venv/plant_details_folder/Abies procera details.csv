See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",A. nobilis.

Succeeds in cold exposed positions and in poor mountain peats[11]. Succeeds in poor thin soils so long as sufficient moisture is present[229]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very shade tolerant, especially when young, but they grow more slowly in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions with a pH down to about 5[200]. Grows well on a north-facing slope[200]. A long-lived tree in the wild, with specimens more than 600 years old recorded[229]. It is a very ornamental tree[1], but is very susceptible to damage by aphis in some areas of the country[1, 11]. Planted for timber in W. and N. Europe[50], in Britain it grows best in wetter parts of the country such as the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11]. Trees do not grow well in the drier areas of Britain[81]. In a suitable site it can make new growth of 1 metre a year until it is 25 metres tall when growth slows[185]. Exposure seems to severely limit growth in height in southern and eastern regions but less so in areas of high rainfall such as N. Wales and Argyll[185]. New growth takes place from early June to August[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Trees are sometimes used as 'Christmas trees'[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, There are no flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
