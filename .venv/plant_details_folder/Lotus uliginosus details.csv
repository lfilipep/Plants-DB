21,Other Uses Description,An insecticide is obtained from the plant[153]. No more details are given. This species is used as a pioneer plant in the reclamation of peat and pumice soils and on other wet acid soils that are unsuitable for the more commonly used Trifolium spp[200]. Nitrogen Fixer.
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in wet acid soils[200]. Dislikes shade[200]. Does well on poor soils[61]. Suitable for naturalistic and conservation plantings in situations that approximate to its natural habitat[200]. A good bee plant[74]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in the spring or autumn. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 15°c. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer."
