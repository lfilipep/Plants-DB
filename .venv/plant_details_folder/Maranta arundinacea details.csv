It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 29°c, but can tolerate 17 - 34°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about 5°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a fertile, moist soil in a sunny or partially shaded position[302 ].

The rhizomes mature about 300 - 365 days after planting[418 ]. Successive crops are usually grown on the same land for 5 - 6 years[418 ]. Yields may within 5 - 6 years be between 10 - 35 tonnes per hectare of rhizomes, from which 2.5 - 7.5 tonnes of starch can be obtained[418 ].
