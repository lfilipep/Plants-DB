24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist to wet, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 29°c, but can tolerate 17 - 34°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about 5°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a fertile, moist soil in a sunny or partially shaded position[302 ]. Succeeds in most fertile, well-drained soils[418 ]. Friable soils are preferred for better tuber development and easy harvesting[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 8[418 ]. The rhizomes mature about 300 - 365 days after planting[418 ]. Successive crops are usually grown on the same land for 5 - 6 years[418 ]. Yields may within 5 - 6 years be between 10 - 35 tonnes per hectare of rhizomes, from which 2.5 - 7.5 tonnes of starch can be obtained[418 ]. Bloom Color: White/Near White.",
