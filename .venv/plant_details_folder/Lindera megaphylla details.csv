22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free rather moist soil[200]. Prefers partial shade or dappled sunlight in a fertile moisture-retentive soil enriched with leafmould[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants succeed outdoors at Kew, where there is a specimen 6 metres tall, though they are rather more tender when young[11]. Plants are much smaller in cultivation than they are in the wild, often making no more than a shrub[200]. The leaves are very aromatic[182]. Plants can be pruned right back to the base if required, though any drastic pruning is best spread over several seasons[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Give some protection from cold for at least the plants first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July in a frame[200].
