3,USDA hardiness,9-12,
4,Known Hazards,"The sap of Aloe species contains anthraquinones. These compounds have several beneficial medicinal actions, particularly as a laxative, and many species of Aloe are thus employed in traditional medicine. Whilst safe in small doses and for short periods of time, anthraquinones do have potential problems if used in excess. These include congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs[ 299 ]. Long term use of anthraquinone laxatives may also play a role in development of colorectal cancer as they have genotoxic potential, and tumorigenic potential[ 299 ].",

13,Summary,"Aloe camperi.  This species from the Aloe genus is indigenous to Africa specifically the regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it is considered as one of the most important medicinal plants. Aloe camperi is a perennial, succulent plant with orange flowers and rosette leaves that grow in clusters. The leaves grow up to 60 cm long and leaf base can reach up to 15 cm wide.  Like other species from the Aloe genus, it is used for treating skin conditions and as a laxative. However, excess use of Aloe sap as a laxative may cause congestion and irritation of the pelvic organs. Plant exudate is known to have anti-fungal properties. Aloe camperi is also cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Aloe camperi is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in) by 0.8 m (2ft 7in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antifungal  Laxative  SkinThis species is said to be one of the most important medicinal plants in Eritrea, although we have very ittle information on its usage. It is likely to be used in ways similar to Aloe vera, where the gel is used to treat a wide range of skin conditions and the bitters from the sap exudate is used as a laxative. The distinctive constituents in Aloe leaves are phenolic compounds, including chromone, anthraquinone or anthrone derivatives. Some of the compounds are found in many species, whereas others occur in only a few[ 299 ]. The main components of the exudate are emodin and aloenin[ 299 ]. The exudate has significant antifungal properties[ 299 ].",

21,Other Uses Description,Other uses rating: Low (1/5). Suitable for xeriscaping. Suitable for growing in containers.,
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Plants can tolerate occasional temperatures down to around -2c, so long as conditions are fairly dry[ 423 ]. Succeeds in full sun to light shade[ 423 ]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[ 423 ]. Aloe species follow the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). CAM plants can fix carbon dioxide at night and photosynthesize with closed stomata during the day, thus minimizing water loss. This, plus their succulent leaves and stems, and the presence of a thick cuticle, makes them well adapted to dry conditions[ 299 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no specific information on this species - in general Aloes are sown in a sandy, well-drained potting soil in a warm, shady position in standard seed trays. Germination takes about three weeks. Cover the seed with a thin layer of sand (1 - 2mm), keep moist. The seedlings can be planted out in individual bags or containers as soon as they are large enough to handle[ 295 ]. Suckers",
