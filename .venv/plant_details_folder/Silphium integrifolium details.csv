13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Silphium integrifolium is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.9 m (3ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

19,Edible Uses Description,bon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: protein-oil (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. Under development at the Land Institute to domesticate this species for use as an oilseed crop. Trials yielded 1.1t/ha of seed [1-1].,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Native American peoples used the roots to treat pain from injuries [4].,
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Garden Ornamental. Compared to other Silphium species, it is shorter, less likely to topple over, and faster from seed to flower. More manageable than most perennial sunflowers as it spreads slowly, and it is not known to be allelopathic. Adapts well to prairies, wildflower/native plant gardens, naturalized areas, meadows or moist, open woodland areas. Attracts birds and butterflies",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein-oil  Under DevelopmentClimate: boreal to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. It needs full sun, poor to loamy soils, and mesic to dry conditions. Average, medium moisture, well-drained soils. Tolerates some light shade. Also tolerates some drought once established. Will grow in a variety of soils including sandy, loamy or clay ones. Cultivation: under development. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Plants may be slow to establish in the garden, particularly when grown from seed. Plants often self-seed in optimum growing conditions. Plants develop taproots. Once established, division is not recommended.",
