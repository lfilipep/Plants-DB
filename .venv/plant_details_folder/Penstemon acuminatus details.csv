22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary rich garden soils so long as they are well-drained[1]. Succeeds in dry soils. Requires a position in full sun[188]. Many members of this genus are very cold hardy, but do not prosper in Britain because they dislike winter wet. This species is more tolerant of British conditions than many other members of the genus[200]. Judging by its native habitat, it is likely to succeed in maritime exposure[K]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring. Alternatively, the seed can be sown in early summer in a greenhouse, the seedlings overwintered in the greenhouse and then planted out in the following spring[1]. Division in autumn[111]. Cuttings can be taken throughout the growing season, though August/September is best[1]."
