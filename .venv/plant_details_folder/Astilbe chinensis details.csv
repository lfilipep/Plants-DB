Only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 20cm tall. Plant them out in the summer, or late in the following autumn. Division in spring. This is best done every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain the vigour of the plant[200]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
