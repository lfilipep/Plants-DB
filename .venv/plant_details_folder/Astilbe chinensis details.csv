Requires a wet or moist peaty soil in sun or partial shade[187], growing well under shrubs[233]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 to 7[200]. Prefers partial shade[200], especially if the soil is on the dry side[233]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in early spring. Only just cover the seed. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame until they are at least 20cm tall. Plant them out in the summer, or late in the following autumn. Division in spring. This is best done every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain the vigour of the plant[200]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well."
