24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeed in almost any neutral or acid soil of good or reasonable quality, preferring a light sandy loam and full sun[200]. Prefers a position sheltered from hot or cold drying winds[200]. Only succeeds outdoors in the mild areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. If plants are killed back in cold winters they sometimes sprout afresh from the old wood[219]. This species does not regenerate from old wood[200]. Resents root disturbance[200]. The leaves have a delightful lemon scent[182, 219]. The forms grown in Britain have a very weak scent, is this due to a lack of sun?[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. The seed remains viable for many years. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm with a heel, early August in a frame. Over-winter in the greenhouse for its first year. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 4 - 5 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. Good percentage[78]."
