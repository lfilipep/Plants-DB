See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The canes are among the strongest and most versatile in this genus[195]. The culms used in making spars furniture, umbrellas and containers[266]. They make excellent plant supports[195].",,"Prefers a rich damp soil in a sheltered position and some shade[200]. Grows well in a woodland. It is estimated that plants will be hardy to about -20°c[195]. Another report says that this species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants have shallow root systems that do not compete with deep tree roots[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
