It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,"Flowers: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",,"Flowers - raw or cooked[105, 155, 161, 183, 257]. They can be used as a flavouring in cooked dishes[257]. The flowers can be boiled, then dried and stored for later use[257]. Seedpods - raw or cooked[229, 257]. They are gathered in the fall and eaten when fresh[229]. The pods can also be cooked then dried and stored for later use[257]. Seed - cooked[229, 257].","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

An emetic, it is used to clear the stomach[216, 257].","Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Plants succeed in dry barren sites, their suckering habit making them suitable for stabilizing banks[200, 229].  - tough, elastic and durable[155, 257]. Used for fence posts etc[155].","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Regional CropLandscape Uses:Specimen. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in any soil, preferring one that is not too rich[1, 200]. Requires a well-drained soil, succeeding on dry barren sites[200]. Plants are tolerant of drought and atmospheric pollution[200]. The branches are brittle and very liable to wind damage[200]. When plants are grown in rich soils they produce coarse and rank growth which is even more liable to wind damage[11, 200]. Plants can be coppiced[155]. Any pruning should be done in late summer in order to reduce the risk of bleeding[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Attractive flowers or blooms.",Seed - pre-soak for 48 hours in warm water and sow the seed in late winter in a cold frame[80]. A short stratification improves germination rates and time[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the following summer. The seed stores for over 10 years[113].
