See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",eaA tea is made from the roots[183]. The roots are also used for making 'root beer'[183].,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Cardiac  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  TonicA tea made from the leaves is diaphoretic[222]. The root is alterative and tonic[257]. An infusion of the root has been used in the treatment of heart diseases[257]. The bark, and especially the root bark, is diuretic and tonic[4, 222]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh root[4]. It has alterative, diaphoretic and diuretic properties and is considered to be a good treatment for dropsy[4].",,Wildlife shelter. Nectary shelter [1-2].,,"Prefers a moderately fertile deep moisture-retentive well-drained loam and a position in semi-shade but also succeeds in a sunny position[200]. Requires a sheltered position[200]. Plants are hardier when grown on poorer soils[200]. This species is especially tolerant of poor dry soils[200]. Prefers an acid soil[184]. Dormant plants are hardy to at least -15°c[184, 200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. The whole plant has an unpleasant smell[4]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 4 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are 25cm or more tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, late spring or early summer being the best time to do this. Root cuttings 8cm long, December in a cold frame[11, 78]. Store the roots upside down in sand and pot up in March/April. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in late winter[11]. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
