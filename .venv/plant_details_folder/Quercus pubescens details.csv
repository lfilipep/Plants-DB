0,Quercus pubescens,Downy Oak,Fagaceae,4-8,None known,Woods and dry hills[100] in both siliceous and limestone soils[11].,Europe.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/QuercusPubescens.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/QuercusPubescens2.jpg",,"Quercus pubescens is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Q. lanuginosa.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - cooked. A famine food, used when all else fails[177]. The seed is up to 2cm long[200], it can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a thickening in stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread. The seed contains bitter tannins, these can be leached out by thoroughly washing the seed in running water though many minerals will also be lost. Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground overwinter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  DysenteryAny galls produced on the tree are strongly astringent and can be used in the treatment of haemorrhages, chronic diarrhoea, dysentery etc[4].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A mulch of the leaves repels slugs, grubs etc, though fresh leaves should not be used as these can inhibit plant growth[20]. Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin, that can also be used as a dyestuff[4].  - hard, durable even under water, not very elastic. Used for furniture etc[46, 61].",,"Prefers a good deep fertile loam which can be on the stiff side[11]. Young plants tolerate reasonable levels of side shade[200]. Tolerates moderate exposure, surviving well but being somewhat stunted. The seed ripens in its first year. Closely related to Q. petraea[1]. Intolerant of root disturbance, trees should be planted in their permanent positions whilst young[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - it quickly loses viability if it is allowed to dry out. It can be stored moist and cool overwinter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees[11]. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being moved or they will transplant very badly.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
