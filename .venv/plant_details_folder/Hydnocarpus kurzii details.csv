When applied externally, and by direct infiltration of the lesions, it has been shown to be effective in decreasing the size of nodules, numb patches, and skin lesions[555 ]. The active principles are unusual cyclopentenic fatty acids including chaulmoogric acid. The precise molecular mycobactericidal mode of action is still unknown[555 ].. The oil contains chaulmoogric and hydnocarpic fatty acids[310 , 317 ]. A decoction of the bark is drunk as a general tonic to improve health and in the treatment of internal disorders and skin diseases[310 , 555 ]. The roots, as well as the seeds, are used by Thai traditional doctors in the treatment of skin diseases[310 ]. An exciting development from this plant is the observation that the oil, when applied to the skin, increases the strength of scar tissue and strengthens the collagen tissue in wounds. Hence some cosmetic and or dermatological application may be possible[555 ]. In addition, the lignans hydnowightin, hydnocarpin, and neohydnocarpin have been isolated in the plant. These have been shown to have cytotoxic potential against various forms of cancer[555 ].",,None known,,"A plant of the wet tropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 1,800 metres.
