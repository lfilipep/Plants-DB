0,Asplenium ceterach,Scale Fern,Polypodiaceae,7-10,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].",Limestone rocks and mortared walls[17].,"Central and southern Europe, including Britain, east to the Himalayas and Caucasus.",(0 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AspleniumCeterach.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AspleniumCeterach2.jpg",,Asplenium ceterach is a FERN growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in).

Some caution should be employed in its use since it has not been fully tested[7].,,None known,,"A calcicole plant, it requires a freely draining but moist alkaline soil[1]. It tolerates full sun but prefers a position with at least part-day shade[200] and also grows in deep shade[219]. Plants can be grown in old brick walls[219]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Spores - best sown as soon as they are ripe on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Germinates in spring[1]. Spring sown spores germinate in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse. Keep them humid until they are well established. When they are at least 15cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
