This plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible tubers in Tropical regions[1], however it is a serious weed of agricultural land in the tropics where it spreads rapidly at the roots[61] and is considered to be one of the world's most damaging weeds[200, 238]. It is subject to statutory control in several countries[238].","Seed - surface sow in the spring and keep the compost moist[164]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 18°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant them out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
