The North American Indians would often flavour this tea with the roots of liquorice fern, Polypodium glycyrrhiza[256]. When lemon is added they can be used as iced tea[183]. The leaves were once added to beer in order to make it heady[183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. It would be better to brew the tea in cold water by leaving it in a sunny place, or to make sure that it is brewed for a short time only in an open container. The leaves are used as a flavouring, they are a bayleaf substitute[172].",

In modern herbalism it is occasionally used externally to treat a range of skin problems. The leaves are analgesic, blood purifier, diaphoretic, diuretic, pectoral and tonic[4, 172, 222, 257]. A tea is taken internally in the treatment of headaches, asthma, colds, stomach aches, kidney ailments etc[222, 257]. Externally, it is used as a wash for burns, ulcers, itches, chapped skin, stings, dandruff etc[222, 238, 257]. An ointment made from the powdered leaves or roots has been used to treat ulcers, cracked nipples, burns and scalds[257].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free loam or peaty soil[1, 11]. Prefers a moist humus-rich acid soil in shade or semi-shade[200]. Plants flower more freely when grown in a sunny position. Plants grow better if they have certain fungal associations in the soil. The best way of providing this is to incorporate some soil from around well-growing established plants into the soil for the new plant[200]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The leaves and the flowers are very aromatic[182, 245]. Plants benefit from removing the dead flowers before they set seed[188]. This prevents them putting too much energy into seed production at the expense of more flowers and leaves. This species is considered by some botanists to be no more than a sub-species of L. palustre[11, 50]. A good bee plant[4].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a shady part of the greenhouse in February or March[78, 113]. Another report says that the seed is best sown in the autumn as soon as it is ripe[188]. Germination is variable and can be quite slow. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the pots on in a shady frame for 18 months before planting them out into their permanent positions[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in spring. Fair percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, November/December in a frame[113]. Layering in the autumn. Takes 12 months[78]. Division.",
