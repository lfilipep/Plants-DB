All parts of plant are poisonous if ingested. Plant has spines or sharp edges; use extreme caution when handling.,"A tropical plant.

As a carbon farming solutions suggested as an Industrial  starch crop. Genera to investigate include: Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Microcycas, and Zamia [1-1]. They make good ornamental landscape plants in borders, Containers, for massing, seashore, and as a specimen. They are drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping.","Encephalartos spp. is an evergreen Perennial growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",See individual species. There are about 60 or more species of Encephalartos.,,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,,"The pith of the trunk, in some species, contains large amount of high quality starch below the crown. This was formerly cut out by native people as food. Encephalartos, like all cycads, are toxic, but the pith, if buried for several years, gets the toxins leached out of it, and then it can safely be cooked into a bread-like food.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: starch (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Female cones are consequently destroyed by baboons, for the tasty pith around the seeds. Vervet monkeys, rodents and birds also feed on the seeds. Ornamental - Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Massing, Seashore, Specimen. Drought-tolerant; suitable for xeriscaping.","Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Industrial Crop: Starch: Materials and chemicals include bioplastics, paper, cardboard, solvents, paints, glues etc. Plants are usually pods, starchy fruits, nuts & seeds, starchy trunks.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.","Hypothetical Crop  Industrial Crop: Starch  Management: StandardClimate: warm temperate to tropical. Humidity: arid to humid. Usually heat-loving succulents that do not like excessive watering or shade. Species have adapted to full sun or shade, and extremes of moisture[314]. Drought-tolerant; suitable for xeriscaping. Average Water Needs; Water regularly; do not overwater. Full Sun but some species can tolerate some shade. They can produce occasional suckers[314]. Some are dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[200]. All Encephalartos species are considered endangered though many are not threatened currently. The whole genus is listed under CITES Appendix I / EU Annex A. CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of these species except for certain non-commercial motives, such as scientific research. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: hypothetical.
