13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Ceroxylon quindiuense is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Wax: Water resistant, malleable substances. Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
19,Edible Uses Description,he fruit is probably edible[K].

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,A wax obtained from the trunk is used for making candles[231].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most fertile moist but well-drained soils in a sheltered sunny position[231]. Requires a humus-rich soil with bright filtered light and cool high humidity[200]. This species tolerates several degrees of short-lived frost in its native climate[231], it can be grown outdoors in essentially frost-free temperate climates[200]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also often be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. This species is the national tree of Colombia[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse at not less than 24°c[188]. Stored seed is very slow to germinate. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing may shorten the germination time. Plants form a long tap-root some time before forming a shoot so the seed is best sown in groups of two or three in each deep pot, thinning if necessary to the best seedling. Germination of fresh seed usually takes place in 3 - 4 months at 25°c[138]. Grow on the plants in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters and plant out in the summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first few winters outdoors."
