0,Allium triquetrum,Three-Cornered Leek,Alliaceae,7-10,"Although no individual reports regarding this species have been seen, there have been cases of poisoning caused by the consumption, in very large quantities and by some mammals, of certain members of this genus. Dogs seem to be particularly susceptible[76].","Hedge banks and waste places on damp soils[17, 90].",S. Europe. Naturalized in Britain in S.W. England[17].,(5 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumTriquetrum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumTriquetrum2.jpg",,"Allium triquetrum is a BULB growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf from February to July, in flower from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Hedgerow;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Bulb - raw or cooked. The rather small bulb is up to 20mm in diameter[200], it has a mild garlic flavour and can be used as a flavouring in salads and cooked foods. It is harvested in early summer when the plant has died down and will store for at least 6 months[K]. Leaves - raw or cooked. A leek substitute[22]. The leaves are available from late autumn until the spring, they are nice in salads when they are young, or cooked as a vegetable or flavouring as they get older[K]. The leaves have a milder and more delicate flavour than onions[183]. Flowers - raw. Juicy with a mild garlic flavour, they make a tasty and decorative garnish on salads[K].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention of medicinal uses has been seen for this species, members of this genus are in general very healthy additions to the diet. They contain sulphur compounds (which give them their onion flavour) and when added to the diet on a regular basis they help reduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the digestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[K].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].,,"Prefers a rich moist but well-drained soil[1, 42]. Shade tolerant[31], it is easily grown in a cool leafy soil[90] and grows well in light moist woodland[203]. Plants are not very hardy outside the milder areas of Britain, they tolerate temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. The seeds have an oil-bearing appendage which is attractive to ants. The ants carry the seed away to eat the oil and then discard the seed, thus aiding dispersal of the plant[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. The picked flowers can remain fresh for several weeks[89]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse or cold frame. It germinates quickly and can be grown on in the greenhouse for the first year, planting out the dormant bulbs in the late summer of the following year if they have developed sufficiently, otherwise grow on in pots for a further year. Stored seed can be sown in spring in a greenhouse. Division in summer after the plants have died down. Very easy, the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
