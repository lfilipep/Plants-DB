Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Cathartic  Diaphoretic  Dysentery  Emetic  Homeopathy  Poultice  VDThe root is cathartic, diaphoretic and emetic[4, 46, 103]. It is used in the treatment of dropsy, diarrhoea, stomach complaints, syphilis and dysentery[4, 257]. A poultice of the root has been applied to sores that are hard to heal[257]. The leaves are analgesic and febrifuge[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of colds and fevers[257]. A poultice of the crushed leaves has been applied to the head to relieve the pain of headaches[257]. At one time in N. America the root of this plant was believed to be effective in the treatment of VD[103, 222]. When used in Europe, however, it was found to be ineffective[213]. This might have been because the N. American Indians used the fresh root (which still contained the volatile oils) and also used it in conjunction with Podophyllum peltatum and Prunus virginiana, and then dusted the ulcers with the bark of Ceanothus americanus[213]. It was believed by some native North American Indian tribes that if the finely ground roots were secretly added to the food of an arguing couple then this would avert a divorce and they would love each other again[213]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[4].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Woodland garden. Requires a moist soil, succeeding in full sun or partial shade[111, 187, 200].
