24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any ordinary garden soil in sun or partial shade[1, 187]. Prefers a light well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. A soil that is too rich encourages foliar growth at the expense of flowering[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[200]. Plants are very fast-growing and often flower in their first year from seed[200]. They flower so freely in their second year that they normally die afterwards, though they sometimes perennate[200]. When well sited, this species usually self-sows freely[200]. There are some named forms developed for their ornamental value[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow late summer in situ[200]. The seed should germinate within 4 weeks.
