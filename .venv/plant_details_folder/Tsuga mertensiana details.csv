See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Hedge;,Shoots: ,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","- raw or dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickening in soups etc or mixed with cereals when making bread[161].

A tea made from the inner bark or twigs is helpful in the treatment of influenza, colds, kidney or bladder problems, and also makes a good enema for treating diarrhoea[21, 257]. It can also be used as a gargle or mouthwash for mouth and throat problems or externally to wash sores and ulcers[21]. The powdered bark can be put into shoes for tender or sweaty feet or for foot odour[21]. A poultice of the chewed leaves has been used to treat burns[257].

They retain an attractive scent for several years[200]. Yields a resin similar to Abies balsamea, it is gathered by incisions in the trunk or by boiling the wood[46, 61, 64]. The bark contains 8 - 14% tannin[46, 171]. The inner bark is used according to one report[82]. A brown dye is obtained from the bark[21, 46]. The boughs are steamed or rubbed on furniture and used as a room deodorant and disinfectant[257]. A pitch (called hemlock pitch), is obtained by distillation of the young branches[46]. Tolerant of light trimming, plants can be grown as a tall hedge[29, 81].  - strong[171]. Used for heavy construction[171]. Close-grained, light, soft and weak according to other reports, which go on to say that it is occasionally manufactured into lumber when other wood is not available[82, 229].",,"Landscape Uses:Hedge, Aggressive surface roots possible, Screen, Specimen, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant, it thrives best when growing in a deep well-drained soil in the western parts of Britain where it appreciates the higher rainfall[11]. However, it succeeds in most soils and positions, being especially good on acidic sandy soils[81]. Plants are very shade tolerant when young, but need more sunlight as they grow older[81, 200]. Plants are thin and poor when grown in dry or exposed places[200]. Dislikes atmospheric pollution[82]. A very ornamental plant[11], it is slow growing for the first few years, averaging 30cm a year, but older trees, especially in Scottish lowland sites in areas with cool moist summers, are growing rapidly[185]. Trees live 400 - 500 years in the wild[229]. They commence bearing seeds when about 20 - 30 years old, years of high production alternating with years of low production[229]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - it germinates better if given a short cold stratification[80, 113] and so is best sown in a cold frame in autumn to late winter. It can also be sown in early spring, though it might not germinate until after the next winter. If there is sufficient seed, an outdoor sowing can be made in spring[78]. Pot-grown seedlings are best potted up into individual pots once they are large enough to handle - grow them on in a cold frame and plant them out in early summer of the following year. Trees transplant well when they are up to 80cm tall, but they are best put in their final positions when they are about 30 - 45 cm or less tall, this is usually when they are about 5 - 8 years old[200]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
