0,Prunus ilicifolia,Holly-Leaved Cherry,Rosaceae,8-11,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Borders of streams and moist sandy soils, where it makes a small tree. It is also found on dry hillsides where it is only a shrub[82].",South-western N. America - California.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Half Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PrunusIlicifolia.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PrunusIlicifolia2.jpg",,"Prunus ilicifolia is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft 1in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from November to December. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Laurocerasus ilicifolia.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw, cooked or dried for later use[92, 161, 183]. A pleasant tart taste[2, 229], it is considered by some people to be a great delicacy[257]. A thin, slightly acid, astringent flesh[82]. The fruit can be mixed with lemon to make a sauce[183]. The fruit only has a very thin flesh, it is about 15mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200, 229]. Seed - raw or cooked[92, 16, 257]. The seed can be ground into a meal, leached to remove the bitterness and then mixed with flour to make bread etc[183]. The seed meal can be leached by placing it in a basket and then pouring warm water over it[257]. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.","Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PectoralAn infusion of the leaves, or of the bark and roots, has been used as a cough medicine[257]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].  - heavy, hard, strong, close grained. Usually too small to be of commercial importance, it is used mainly as a fuel[82, 229].",,"Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil[11]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Succeeds in full sun but prefers a position with some shade[200]. Thrives in a loamy soil, doing well on limestone[11]. Prefers some chalk in the soil but it is apt to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it should succeed when grown against a sunny wall in the milder areas of the country[182, 219]. Young plants are very susceptible to frost damage, though they become somewhat hardier as they age[219]. It is hardy in the mildest areas of the country[11]. Trees are moderately fast-growing when young, though they slow with age. They often live more than 100 years in the wild[229]. Heavy fruit crops are produced periodically[229]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200].
