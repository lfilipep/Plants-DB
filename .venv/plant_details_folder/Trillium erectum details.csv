It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked. Used in spring[207], the young unfolding leaves are an excellent addition to the salad bowl, tasting somewhat like sunflower seeds[183]. Leaves can also be cooked as a potherb[183].","Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Aphrodisiac  Astringent  Birthing aid  Expectorant  Poultice  Tonic  Urinary  Uterine tonicBeth root was traditionally used by various native North American Indian tribes as a woman's herb to aid childbirth, as a treatment for irregular menstrual periods, period pains and excessive vaginal discharge[254]. Modern research has shown that the root contains steroidal saponins, which have hormonal effects on the body[222, 238]. These saponins are being used in gynaecological and obstetric medicine[238]. This herb should not be taken during pregnancy except under professional supervision[254]. The root is antiseptic, aphrodisiac, astringent, expectorant, tonic, uterine tonic[4, 46, 61, 165, 222, 238]. It is used internally in the treatment of a wide range of women's complaints including haemorrhage from the uterus, urinary tract and lungs, and also to curb excessive menstruation[238]. It has proved to be of value in stopping bleeding after parturition[244]. Externally, it is used to treat excessive vaginal discharge, ulcers (especially varicose), skin complaints, gangrene, insect bites and stings[238, 244]. It is also used as a wash for sore nipples[244]. The root is harvested in late summer, after the leaves have died down, and is dried for later use[213, 238]. The whole plant is used as a poultice for tumours, inflammations and ulcers[222].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Ground cover, Woodland garden. Prefers a deep well-drained woodland or humus-rich soil in a somewhat shady position that remains moist in the summer[1, 42]. Prefers a neutral to slightly acid soil[200]. Grows well in open deciduous woodland[1, 90]. Succeeds in a sunny position if the soil does not dry out[42]. Succeeds in deep shade[188]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -35°c[238]. Plants are long-lived[233]. Any transplanting is best done whilst the plants are in flower[200]. A very variable species[200], it is subject to mutation[90]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233], though slugs are very fond of the leaves[238]. The flowers have an unattractive smell rather like putrefied flesh[42, 207, 245]. The white-flowered form, blandum, is almost scentless[245]. Plants can flower in two years from seed[138].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Flowers have an unpleasant odor.","Seed - best sown in a shaded cold frame as soon as it is ripe[134, 200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring. Seed usually germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c. Another report says that seeds produce a root after the first cold stratification but no shoot is produced until after a second winter[138], whilst yet another report says that the seed can take 3 years to germinate[238]. The seedlings are prone to damp off and must therefore be watered with care and given plenty of fresh air[138]. The young plants need to be overwintered in a cold frame for the first year and can then be planted out in late spring. It is very important that the pots become neither too dry nor too wet[138]. Division with care when the plants die down after flowering[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
