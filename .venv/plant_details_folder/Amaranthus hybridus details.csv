0,Amaranthus hybridus,"Rough Pigweed, Slim amaranth",Amaranthaceae,6-12,"No members of this genus are known to be poisonous, but when grown on nitrogen-rich soils they are known to concentrate nitrates in the leaves. This is especially noticeable on land where chemical fertilizers are used. Nitrates are implicated in stomach cancers, blue babies and some other health problems. It is inadvisable, therefore, to eat this plant if it is grown inorganically.","Of uncertain origin, it grows wild in cultivated fields and waste places[43].",Tropics. Naturalized in Europe[50].,(4 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusHybridus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusHybridus5.jpg","The nutritious mildly flavoured leaves and young seedlings can be eaten raw or cooked and used as a spinach substitute. Seeds are used as a cereal substitute and used in porridges and bread. Other common Name: Smooth Pigweed, Green Amaranth; Slim Amaranth. Spanish: bledo; quelite. French: amarante hybride. Portuguese: caruru-de-folha-larga. Brazil: caruru-branco; caruru-roxo. Germany: Bastard - Amarant; Gruenaehriger. Japan: honagaaogeito. Netherlands: basterdamarant.","Amaranthus hybridus is a ANNUAL growing to 2 m (6ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. chlorostachys.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Leaves and young seedlings - cooked as a spinach, added to soups etc or eaten raw[46, 61, 62, 159, 183]. The nutritious leaves have a mild flavour[K]. Seed - raw or cooked[22, 46, 61, 85]. Used as a cereal substitute, the seed is usually ground into a flour for use in porridges, bread etc. It is rather small, about 1mm in diameter[266], but is easy to harvest and very nutritious[K]. The seed can be cooked whole, and becomes very gelatinous like this, but it is rather difficult to crush all of the small seeds in the mouth and thus some of the seed will pass right through the digestive system without being assimilated[K].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AstringentA tea made from the leaves is astringent[105, 222]. It is used in the treatment of intestinal bleeding, diarrhoea, excessive menstruation etc[222, 257].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Yellow and green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168].,,"Prefers a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Requires a hot sheltered position if it is to do well[K]. Plants should not be given inorganic fertilizers, see notes above on toxicity. Cultivated as a food crop in India[46, 105], there are many named forms[183]. This species has the potential, through crossbreeding, of imparting early maturity to the white seeded grain amaranths[183]. Most if not all members of this genus photosynthesize by a more efficient method than most plants. Called the 'C4 carbon-fixation pathway', this process is particularly efficient at high temperatures, in bright sunlight and under dry conditions[196]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].",Seed - sow late spring in situ. An earlier sowing can be made in a greenhouse and the plants put out after the last expected frosts. Germination is usually rapid and good if the soil is warm[133]. A drop in temperature overnight aids germination[133]. Cuttings of growing plants root easily[206].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
