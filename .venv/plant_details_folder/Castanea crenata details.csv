See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",C. japonica.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - raw or cooked[1, 46, 61]. A good potato substitute[63, 105, 142, 171]. A source of starch[177]. Very poor flavour[142]. Coarse and of little value. Very variable in size and quality, any astringency can be removed by boiling the seed in salty water[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The bark, leaves, wood and seed husks all contain tannin.  - hard, strong, light, very durable. Used for furniture, construction, fence posts etc[46, 61].","Industrial Crop: Tannin: Occur generally in the roots, wood, bark, leaves, and fruit of many plants. Used in tanning leather, dyeing fabric, making ink, and medical applications.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","Industrial Crop: Tannin  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbPrefers a good well-drained slightly acid loam but succeeds in dry soils[1, 11, 200]. Once established, it is very drought tolerant[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of highly acid, infertile dry sands[200]. Averse to calcareous soils but succeeds on harder limestones[11, 200]. The majority of species in this genus only really thrive in areas with hot summers, though this species is better adapted to British conditions than most[200]. Cultivated for its edible seed in Japan, there are many named varieties[58, 63, 183]. It is often also cultivated for its seed in America because it is fairly resistant to chestnut blight[171, 200]. Individual trees are very variable with regard to size of the seed, resistance to blight and astringency of the seed[183]. Some cultivars have the largest seeds of any member of this genus. Trees fruit freely when only 3 - 3.5 metres tall[11]. This species is occasionally planted as a timber tree in S. Europe[50]. An excellent soil-enriching understorey in pine forests[200]. Flowers are produced on wood of the current year's growth[229]. Plants are fairly self-sterile[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - where possible sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in a seed bed outdoors[78]. The seed must be protected from mice and squirrels. The seed has a short viability and must not be allowed to become dry. It can be stored in a cool place, such as the salad compartment of a fridge, for a few months if it is kept moist, but check regularly for signs of germination. The seed should germinate in late winter or early spring. If sown in an outdoor seedbed, the plants can be left in situ for 1 - 2 years before planting them out in their permanent positions. If grown in pots, the plants can be put out into their permanent positions in the summer or autumn, making sure to give them some protection from the cold in their first winter[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
