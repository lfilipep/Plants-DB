Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Mid summer. Form: Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect, Variable spread.","Phalaris arundinacea is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",,Ground Cover; Bog Garden;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Pollution: Plants used to combat pollution.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","Plants have a running root system and form an impenetrable ground cover. They should be mown 2 - 3 times in their first 2 - 3 years in order to encourage thick growth[200]. Plants are best spaced about 60cm apart each way[208]. The leaves have been woven into hats and mats[257]. his is one of the main species used in the reed bed system for the water purification treatment of grey water and for irrigation with pollution control sewage effluent from municipal and industrial sources[269]. One of the highest yielding fodder grasses with annual yields ranging from 8 - 20 tonnes per hectare, it has potential as a source of biomass[269].","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  New Crop  Staple Crop: ProteinLandscape Uses:Border, Container, Erosion control, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. A very easy plant to grow, it succeeds in ordinary garden soil[187], though it grows best on moist sandy soils, rich in organic matter[269]. It also does well on fertile loams and clays[269]. Succeeds in most soils, whether dry or wet[200] and is moderately tolerant of drought[269]. It does not like saline soils[269]. The plant is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 30 to 260cm, an annual temperature in the range of of 5 to 23°C and a pH of 4.5 to 8.2[269]. Plants can be very invasive, especially in moist conditions, there dense growth provides good cover for water fowl[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187, 200]. This is one of the first grasses to come into growth in the spring[269]. There are many named forms, selected mainly for their ornamental value[200].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Invasive, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Suitable for dried flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
