13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Sedum spectabile is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from September to October, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown and tolerant plant, it succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates poor soils[233]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200], they can also tolerate considerable neglect, surviving even in the dense growth of weeds[K]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. This species has pink flowers[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. The flowers have a honey-like smell similar to Buddleias[245]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are some named varieties[187]. The flowers are very attractive to bees and lepidoptera[30]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Cuttings at almost any time in the growing season. Very easy, even a single leaf will produce roots and form a new plant."
