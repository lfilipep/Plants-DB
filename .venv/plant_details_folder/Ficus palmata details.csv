The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw. Sweet and succulent[2]. A very tasty fruit[194], it is often dried for later use. The fruit is about 2.5cm in diameter and annual yields from wild trees is about 25kg[194]. The fruit contains about 6% sugars, 1.7% protein, 0.9% ash and 0.2% pectin[194]. Low in vitamin C, about 3.3mg per 100g[194]. The unripe fruits and young growth are cooked and eaten as a vegetable[272]. They are boiled, the water is removed by squeezing and they are then fried. a nice green vegetable[194]. Some caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Warts: Used in the treatment of warts, corns etc.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Demulcent  Emollient  Laxative  Poultice  WartsThe fruit is demulcent, emollient, laxative and poultice[194, 240]. It is used as a part of the diet in the treatment of constipation and diseases of the lungs and bladder[240]. The sap is used in the treatment of warts. The latex of the plant is used to take out spines lodged deeply in the flesh[272].",
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"The pliable wood is of little value but has been used for making hoops, garlands, ornaments etc.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained medium to light loam and some lime rubble incorporated into the soil. A heavy wet soil tends to encourage excessive plant growth at the expense of fruit. Not very hardy in Britain it is best on a south or south-west facing wall in order to provide winter protection and more heat in the summer for ripening the fruit. It would probably succeed in a sheltered position in the open in the milder areas of Britain. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. This species is closely related to the common fig, Ficus carica, and is not perhaps specifically distinct. It has been recommended for growing in areas where the climate is too wet for common figs since it fruits during the monsoon season in the Himalayas. However, it probably requires the fig-wasp in order to pollinate the flowers and so is unlikely to fruit in areas such as Britain that are too cold for the fig-wasp to survive. The fruits are often sold in local markets in the Himalayas[194]. There is a potential for commercial cultivation[194].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse for at least their first year. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts and give some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of mature wood 10 - 12cm with a heel, winter in a frame. Fairly easy, but the cuttings must be kept frost free. It is probably best if the cuttings are put in individual pots[78]. Layering.",
