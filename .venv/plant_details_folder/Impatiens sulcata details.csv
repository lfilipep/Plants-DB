4,Known Hazards,"Regular ingestion of large quantities of these plants can be dangerous due to their high mineral content[172]. This report, which seems nonsensical, might refer to calcium oxalate. This mineral is found in I. capensis and so is probably also in other members of the genus. It can be harmful raw but is destroyed by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant[K]. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones and hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet[238].",
5,Habitats,"Humus-rich soils[145] in forests, shrubberies and cultivated areas, 1800 - 4000 metres[51]. Understories of Picea forests, along canals, shaded moist places; 3000 - 4000 metres in Tibet[266].",
