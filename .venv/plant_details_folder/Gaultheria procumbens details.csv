14,Physical Characteristics,"Gaultheria procumbens is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"eaFruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 14, 95, 101]. Pleasant but insipid[11]. The fruit is not at all insipid, it has a very strong spicy taste of germolene, just like being in a hospital waiting room[K]. Best after a frost, the fruit hangs onto the plant until spring if it is not eaten by birds etc[62, K]. The fruits can also be used in pies, or made into jams etc[183]. The fruit is up to 15mm in diameter[200]. Young leaves - raw[62, 102, 106]. A pleasant wayside nibble if used when very young[183]. Dry and powdery according to our taste buds[K]. A very agreeable tea is made from the fresh leaves[3, 95, 183]. A stronger tea can be made by first fermenting the bright red leaves[183]. 'Oil of wintergreen' can be distilled from this plant. It is used to flavour beer, sweets, chewing gum etc[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Aromatic  Astringent  Carminative  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Stimulant  TonicCheckerberry leaves were widely used by the native North American Indians in the treatment of aches and pains and to help breathing whilst hunting or carrying heavy loads[238]. An essential oil (known as 'oil of wintergreen') obtained from the leaves contains methyl salicylate, which is closely related to aspirin and is an effective anti-inflammatory[213]. This species was at one time a major source of methyl salicylate, though this is now mainly synthesized[238]. The leaves, and the oil, are analgesic, anti-inflammatory, aromatic, astringent, carminative, diuretic, emmenagogue, stimulant and tonic[4, 21, 165]. An infusion of the leaves is used to relieve flatulence and colic[254]. The plant, especially in the form of the essential oil, is most useful when applied externally in the treatment of acute cases of rheumatism, sciatica, myalgia, sprains, neuralgia and catarrh[4, 238]. The oil is sometimes used in the treatment of cellulitis, a bacterial infection that causes the skin to become inflamed[254]. Some caution is advised, especially if the oil is used internally, since essential oil is toxic in excess, causing liver and kidney damage[4, 238]. It should not be prescribed for patients who are hypersensitive to salicylates (aspirin)[238]. The leaves can be gathered at any time from spring to early autumn, they are dried for use in infusions or distilled to produce the oil[238].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the leaves by steam distillation[2, 14, 57, 213]. In order to obtain the oil, the leaves need to be steeped for 12 - 24 hours in water[4]. The essential oil is used as a food flavouring, medicinally (the original source of Wintergreen oil used as a liniment for aching muscles) and in perfumery and toothpastes. In large doses it can be toxic[165, 244]. A good ground-cover plant for shady positions though it requires weeding for the first year or so[28, 31, 197]. Forming a dense tuft-like carpet, it roots as it spreads and should be spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a moist but not boggy humus rich soil in shade or semi-shade[11, 182]. A peat and moisture loving species, it requires a lime-free soil[11, 182]. Succeeds in dry soils once it is well established and tolerates considerable drought[208]. Grows well under the thin shade of deciduous shrubs or evergreens[4, 11]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -35°c[160]. Plants can become invasive when growing in good conditions[182]. Some named forms have been developed for their ornamental value, 'Dart's Red Giant' has specially large berries[182]. All parts of the plant are aromatic, the bruised leaves having the scent of wintergreen[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. A clumping mat former. Forming a dense prostrate carpet spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. Pre-chill for 4 - 10 weeks and then surface sow in a lime-free compost in a shady part of the greenhouse and keep the compost moist[78]. The seed usually germinates well, usually within 1 - 2 months at 20°c, but the seedlings are liable to damp off. It is important to water them with care and to ensure that they get plenty of ventilation. Watering them with a garlic infusion can also help to prevent damping of[K]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are about 25mm tall and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter[K]. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. The seedlings are susceptible to spring frosts so might need some protection for their first few years outdoors. The leaves remain very small for the first few years[11]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 3 - 6cm long, July/August in a frame in a shady position. They form roots in late summer or spring[78]. A good percentage usually take. Division can be carried out at almost any time of the year, but works best in the spring just before new growth begins[K]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
