This species usually requires greenhouse protection in Britain[1], but plants can succeed outdoors on a wall in mild areas of the country[166]. They tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c[157] in Australian gardens but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters.","Seed - best sown in a warm greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Only just cover the seed. Sow stored seed in early spring in a warm greenhouse. The germination of fresh seed is usually prolific, but stored seed can take a year to germinate[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 12cm with a heel, July/August in a frame.
