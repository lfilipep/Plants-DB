It is evergreen and perennial, and grows up to 6 m tall and 50 mm in diameter at the base. The leaves are narrow and sword-shaped. The young shoots are edible - eaten as a side dish or cooked in soups and stews. Awi Tela is also planted as a hedge, or to prevent soil erosion on steep hills. The erect canes are used in basketry. Awi Tela is propagated by seeds, division, or culm cuttings."

Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Planted extensively to prevent soil erosion on steep hills[303 , 310 ]. Often planted as a hedge[303 , 310 ]. Other Uses: The canes are used to make basketry[303 , 310 ]. The canes are 5 - 6 metres long, 30 - 50 mm in diameter at the base, with a thin wall. Very dense with large leaves and slightly weeping culms. Good two-story screener. Its lush foliage gives an excellent tropical feel to even the smallest of gardens."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Regional CropA plant of the lowland tropics, though it can be found at elevations up to 1,500 metres[303 ]. It prefers humid conditions[303 ]. Upright, slightly weeping, tight clumping. Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[K ]. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. Prefers tropical or subtropical climates. Full sun to part shade."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - Division. Culm cuttings. This method is mostly used for establishing hedges and for erosion control measures[303].
