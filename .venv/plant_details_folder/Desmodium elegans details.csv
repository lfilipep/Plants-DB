See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",D. tiliifolium.(D.Don.)G.Don. Hedysarum tiliifolium.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",,"Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Carminative  Cholera  Diuretic  TonicThe roots are carminative, diuretic and tonic[240, 272]. They are used in the treatment of bilious complaints[240, 243].The juice of the root, sometimes combined with the bark juice of Bauhinia malabarica, is used in the treatment of cholera[272]. The juice of the bark is used in the treatment of peptic ulcers[272].","Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.","A fibre from the bark is used for ropes and paper making[146, 158]. The wood is a good fuel[146, 158].",,"Succeeds in most soils so long as they are well-drained[182, 200]. Requires a sunny sheltered position[175, 182]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. Requires long hot summers to be at its best, the flowers are produced on the current years growth and do not open in cold wet seasons[11]. Plants send up new shoots 1 - 1.5m long annually from a woody base[11]. If the plant is not cut back to the ground by winter cold then it is best to prune it hard in late winter in order to encourage better flowering[182]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Scarify and pre-soak stored seed for 5 hours in warm water then sow March in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates within 1 - 4 months at 25°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from frost in their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame. Division as the plant comes into growth in the spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings in winter.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
