The heartwood is pale pinkish to reddish-brown with occasional darker streaks; the 4 - 17cm wide band of sapwood is whitish to straw coloured. The texture is rather coarse; the grain straight to shallowly interlocked; the surface lustrous; may be somewhat gummy. The wood is light in weight, soft; it is not very durable, having a slight resistance to fungi and being susceptible to dry wood borers and termites. It seasons rapidly, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood works easily with hand and machine tools, quartersawn material tends to tear in planing and shaping, produces a woolly finish unless tools are kept sharp, nails, screws well; gluing is correct, though assembling and gluing is sometimes difficult due to the warping of dried veneers. It is liable to sap stain, log conversion should be rapid. The wood is used for plywood, joinery, general millwork, furniture components, boxes and crates, a decorative veneer can be produced from selected logs[316 , 848 ]. In Sierra Leone it has been reported that trees with a bole diameter of 90?100 cm yield 6?9 m_ of usable wood.[299]","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional CropDaniellia ogea occurs in evergreen and semi-deciduous forest, also in swampy localities near water courses, from sea-level up to 800 m altitude. In Nigeria it occurs in old tree plantations after felling of the plantation trees. In forest management, there is generally no focus on Daniellia ogea because it is not a preferred timber tree. In Sierra Leone the average density of trees with a bole diameter of more than 60 cm has been estimated to be 0.06 per ha. The minimum bole diameter allowed for harvesting is 60 cm in C?te d?Ivoire and Cameroon, 70 cm in Liberia and 90 cm in Ghana.
