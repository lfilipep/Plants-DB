The USDA acknowledge it has been used as a synonym for Hylotelephium erythrostictum.,"Sedum arboroseum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Sedum erythrostictum. Miq. Hylotelephium erythrostictum. (Miq.)H.Ohba.,Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Poultice  Women's complaintsThe leaves are used in the treatment of fevers, inflammations and wounds[218]. The leaf juice is applied to burns and eruptions[218]. The flowers are used in the treatment of vaginal fluxes, nervous afflictions of children, corneal opacity and prolapse of the genitals following labour[218]. The whole plant is crushed and used as a poultice on inflammations etc[218].",,None known,,"Succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil, succeeding in dry soils but preferring one that does not dry out completely[200]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200]. Plants can be grown on walls[200]. Requires a sunny position[188]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].","Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
