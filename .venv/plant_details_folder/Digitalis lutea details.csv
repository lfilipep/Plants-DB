It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,"Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Diuretic  Stimulant  TonicYellow foxglove is little used in herbal medicine but is in fact a less toxic alternative to the purple and woolly foxgloves (D. purpurea and D. lanata) which are widely used in the treatment of heart complaints[254]. The yellow foxglove has similar medical actions, but its alkaloids are more readily metabolized and flushed out of the body[254]. The leaves are cardiac, strongly diuretic, stimulant and tonic[7, 9, 46, 61]. They are used in the treatment of a weakened or failing heart, increasing the strength of contraction, slowing and steadying the heart rate and lowering blood pressure by strongly stimulating the flow of urine - which reduces overall blood volume[254]. The leaves of plants in their second year of growth are harvested in the summer and dried for later use[7]. This remedy should be used with caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner, excessive doses can prove fatal[7, 254]. See also the notes above on toxicity.","Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.",An infusion of the plant added to the water in the vase will prolong the life of cut flowers[54]. When grown near root crops the roots will store better[54].,,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in ordinary garden soil, especially if it is rich in organic matter[1]. It also succeeds in dry soils and, once established, is drought tolerant[188, 190]. It prefers semi-shade but succeeds in full sun if the soil is moist[188, 200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. The yellow foxglove is a good companion plant, stimulating the growth of nearby plants[54]. Root crops grown near to this plant will store better[54].","Seed - surface sow early spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
