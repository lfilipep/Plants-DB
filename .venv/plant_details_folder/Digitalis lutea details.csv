19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Diuretic  Stimulant  TonicYellow foxglove is little used in herbal medicine but is in fact a less toxic alternative to the purple and woolly foxgloves (D. purpurea and D. lanata) which are widely used in the treatment of heart complaints[254]. The yellow foxglove has similar medical actions, but its alkaloids are more readily metabolized and flushed out of the body[254]. The leaves are cardiac, strongly diuretic, stimulant and tonic[7, 9, 46, 61]. They are used in the treatment of a weakened or failing heart, increasing the strength of contraction, slowing and steadying the heart rate and lowering blood pressure by strongly stimulating the flow of urine - which reduces overall blood volume[254]. The leaves of plants in their second year of growth are harvested in the summer and dried for later use[7]. This remedy should be used with caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner, excessive doses can prove fatal[7, 254]. See also the notes above on toxicity.",
20,Other Uses,"Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.",
21,Other Uses Description,An infusion of the plant added to the water in the vase will prolong the life of cut flowers[54]. When grown near root crops the roots will store better[54].,
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in ordinary garden soil, especially if it is rich in organic matter[1]. It also succeeds in dry soils and, once established, is drought tolerant[188, 190]. It prefers semi-shade but succeeds in full sun if the soil is moist[188, 200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. The yellow foxglove is a good companion plant, stimulating the growth of nearby plants[54]. Root crops grown near to this plant will store better[54].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow early spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 20°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer.",
