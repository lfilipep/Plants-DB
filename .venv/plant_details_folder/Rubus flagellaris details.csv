0,Rubus flagellaris,Northern Dewberry,Rosaceae,3-7,None known,"Dry fields, openings and borders of thickets[43] in slightly acid soils[159].",Eastern N. America.,(3 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RubusFlagellaris2.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RubusFlagellaris2.jpg",,"Rubus flagellaris is a deciduous Shrub growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 2 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects, Apomictic (reproduce by seeds formed without sexual fusion).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,"Fruit: ,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked in pies, preserves etc[46, 61, 105, 161, 171, 183, 257]. A rich flavour[43]. The fruit is about 15mm in diameter[200]. Young shoots - peeled and eaten raw[183]. They are harvested as they come through the ground in spring and whilst they are still young and tender. The dried leaves make a fine tea[183].","Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles). This would probably be best added to another heading.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antihaemorrhoidal  Antirheumatic  Astringent  Stimulant  Tonic  VDThe root is astringent, stimulant and tonic[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea, venereal disease and rheumatism[257]. An infusion has been used as a wash in the treatment of piles[257]. The root has been chewed as a treatment for a coated tongue[257]. The leaves are astringent[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. A black dye is obtained from the green twigs[207].,,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. A very polymorphic species[43], it is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit and there are some named varieties[1, 171, 183]. This species is a blackberry with biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. The plant produces apomictic flowers, these produce fruit and viable seed without fertilization, each seedling is a genetic copy of the parent[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
