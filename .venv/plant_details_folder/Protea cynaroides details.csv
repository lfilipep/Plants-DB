See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,South Wall. By. West Wall.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a very well-drained light soil[1, 124], preferably on the poor side[200], with plenty of humus and sand[1]. Requires a pH of 6.5 or lower[200]. Plants are very difficult to grow[188], they are sensitive to nitrates and phosphates in the soil, these can prove toxic even at moderate levels[200]. Plants require reasonable potassium levels[260] and may also suffer from magnesium deficiency[200]. Requires a position with good air circulation[1, 124], but sheltered from cold winds[200]. Dislikes warm sultry or windless days[1, 124]. Requires full exposure to the sun[200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, but they can be grown outdoors in selected areas. They tolerate slight short-lived frosts once they are established. Plants at Tresco on the Scilly Islands tolerated temperatures down to -9°c over a period of 10 days[200]. Plants generally tolerate temperatures down to about -6°c, although prolonged frosts, or frosts combined with cold dry winds will cause damage[124]. They are best grown in a cool greenhouse, but plants can be placed outdoors in the summer[1]. A very ornamental plant[1]. A good bee plant, providing an abundance of nectar[46]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and should be grown in pots until they are planted into their final positions[1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in individual pots in a greenhouse. See notes above on soil requirements. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood.
