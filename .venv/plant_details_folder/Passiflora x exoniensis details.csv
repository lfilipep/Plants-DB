24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained soil with plenty of moisture in the growing season, otherwise it is not fussy[1, 200]. Dislikes highly alkaline soils[202]. Plants are not very frost hardy, the top growth tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c, though the roots are somewhat hardier[260]. It can be grown outdoors in a sheltered position in the mildest areas of the country[262]. It is best to apply a good mulch to the roots each winter in order to protect them from the cold[262]. Plants produce tendrils and climb by attaching these to other plants. If fruit is required, especially when the plant is grown indoors, it is best to hand pollinate using pollen from a flower that has been open for 12 hours to pollinate a newly opened flower before midday[88, 200]. The flowers open in sunny weather and do not open on dull cloudy days[219]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202]. Any pruning is best carried out in the spring[219]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow late winter or early spring in a warm greenhouse. If sown in January and grown on fast it can flower and fruit in its first year[88]. The seed germinates in 1 - 12 months at 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. It you are intending to grow the plants outdoors, it is probably best to keep them in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Mulch the roots well in late autumn to protect them from the cold. This species is a hybrid and, as such, will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of young shoots, 15cm with a heel, in spring[1, 262]. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262]. Leaf bud cuttings in spring. Cuttings of fully mature wood in early summer. Takes 3 months. High percentage[3]."
