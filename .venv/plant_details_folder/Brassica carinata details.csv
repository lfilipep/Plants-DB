0,Brassica carinata,Abyssinian Cabbage,Brassicaceae or Cruciferae,9-12,"The oil contained in the seed of this species is rich in erucic acid which is toxic. However, modern cultivars have been selected which are almost free of erucic acid.",An occasional bird-sown alien on waste ground in Britain.,N. Africa - Ethiopia. Occasional in Britain.,(4 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Half Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Brassica-carinata1b.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Brassica-Carinata-Flowers.jpg","Abyssinian cabbage, Brassica carinata, is a tropical erect plant that grows around 100 – 180 cm tall. It is a popular leaf crop in Africa and its seeds are used as relief from stomach aches. The stem is waxy, the leaves are light green and stalked, and the flower is yellow.  Edible portions are the leaves, young stems, immature flowering stems, and seeds. The seed also produces edible oil that has many other uses. B. carinata can be grown as a green manure.","Brassica carinata is a ANNUAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is not frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Oil: Oil,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Oil: ","eaves and young stems - raw or cooked[2, 52, 61, 141]. Used when up to 30cm tall[183]. A mild and pleasant cabbage flavour[K], the young growth can be cut finely and used in mixed salads, whilst older leaves are cooked like cabbage leaves[183]. Immature flowering stems - cooked. Used like broccoli[183], they make a nice vegetable[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183]. Oil from the wild species is high in erucic acid, which is toxic[141], though there are some cultivars that contain very little erucic acid and can be used as food[K]. The seed can also be crushed and used as a condiment[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The seed is used in the treatment of stomach aches[299].,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","An oil that is high in erucic acid can be obtained from the seed[289]. Traditionally, it is used for oiling the baking plates of earthenware 'injera' stoves and also for illumination[299]. The oil finds wide application in the production of water repellents, waxes, polyesters and lubricants[418].  The seed oil is used to produce bio-diesel or special erucic acid derivatives[418]. This plant is also part of a research to develop an aviation biofuel for jet engines. Agroforestry Uses: The plant can be grown as a green manure[418].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.","Management: Standard  Minor Global Crop  Staple Crop: Oil  Staple Crop: ProteinThis species is very tolerant of a wide range of climatic conditions and can be grown from the temperate to tropical zones. In cool temperate it is only suitable as a leaf crop, but in other areas it can also be grown for its seed. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 10 - 25°c, but can tolerate 5 - 35°c[418]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 800 - 1,700mm[418].Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200]. Succeeds in any reasonable soil[52]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 8, tolerating 5 - 8.5[418].Plants develop an extensive root system, larger than in other Brassica species[299].There is a difference in first flowering date between oil types and vegetable types; oil types start flowering about 10 weeks after germination, vegetable cultivars after about 12 weeks, depending on cultivar and growing conditions. Flowering of vegetable cultivars is delayed by regular harvesting of the leaves or young shoots[299]. Plants grown in dry regions flower earlier and produce ripe seeds within 4 months from sowing[299]. Vegetable crops grown with adequate moisture produce seeds in 5 - 6 months[299].An average leaf and shoot yield of 35 tonnes per hectare can be expected, but at research stations leaf yields of 50 - 55 tonnes have been reported[299].In India and Canada farmers may get seed yields of 1,200 - 1,800 kg per hectare in a good year[299].Some tall cultivars, when grown with adequate moisture, may develop new shoots after removal of the infructescences and become perennial, normally for one further season, but plants of up to 4 years old have been recorded[299].Most Brassica species are cross-pollinating, which contributes to the great diversity within species. Brassica carinata is an exception as it sets seed very efficiently through self-pollination without insects acting as pollinators[299].The plant does not need low temperatures for flower initiation, and seed production is therefore much easier in Africa than for most Brassica oleracea leaf cabbages except for Portuguese kale[299].There are some named varieties. 'Texsel' is especially good for temperate climates, it is fast growing even at relatively low temperatures[141, 200].Research has produced a collection of lines with characteristics suitable for modern agriculture. Varieties are available, including different oil types, such as low erucic (0%) and very high erucic (+ 50%) content[289].This plant is unknown in the wild. It arose as a natural amphidiploid hybrid of female B. Nigra and male B. Oleracea[289].",Seed - sow in situ in succession from March to early September.
