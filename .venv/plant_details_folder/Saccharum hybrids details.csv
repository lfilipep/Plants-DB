0,Saccharum hybrids,Energy Cane,Poaceae,8-12,Sugarcane production has probably caused more biodiversity loss than any other crop [1-1].,Originated in cultivation.,Not known as a wild plant. Hybrid of Asian species.,(4 of 5),(4 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Saccharum_hybrids1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Saccharum_hybrids2.JPEG","Sugarcane production has probably caused more biodiversity loss than any other crop. ""Noble"" cane types are optimized for sugar production while Energy cane types have three times the fiber for use as biofuel. Many energy canes are the result of crosses with biomass grasses like Miscanthus, raising the interesting possibility of cold-tolerant sugarcane   [1-1].","Saccharum hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 6 m (19ft) by 1.5 m (5ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,bon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: sugar (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Possible. See individual species.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. ""Noble"" cane types are optimized for sugar production while Energy cane types have three times the fiber for use as biofuel. Many energy canes are the result of crosses with biomass grasses like Miscanthus, raising the interesting possibility of cold-tolerant sugarcane [1-1]. : bank.","Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.",Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  New Crop  Staple Crop: SugarClimate: subtropical to tropical. Humidity: humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. Need not be grown in large monocultures as is common in homegardens around the world [1-1]. Global sugarcane biomass yields averaged 70.2t/ha in 2012 [1-1]. Sugarcane and energy cane breeding is active and ongoing including GMO types.,"Seed - Cuttings, consisting of 2 - 3 joints of the upper part of a stem that has been selected from a vigorous, healthy plant. They are placed in the ground with only 2 - 5cm of the cutting projecting above the surface. In about two weeks from planting the 'eyes' at each node will send forth shoots, and roots will grow from the nodes themselves. As the shoots develop, the parent stem decays and the young plants produce roots of their own[459 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
