13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Brassica oleracea botrytis is a BIENNIAL growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Immature flowering head - raw or cooked[1, 16, 37, 46]. A mild cabbage-like flavour, they make an excellent cooked vegetable and are also very acceptable in salads[K]. By careful selection of cultivars, it is possible to produce flowering heads all year round[K]. Leaves - cooked[37]. A mild cabbage flavour, they make a good cooked vegetable[K]. Do not over-harvest them, however, since this would adversely affect the production of the flowering head[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Companion: Companion planting is the careful placement of plants (especially vegetables and herbs) which have been shown to have beneficial effects on one another.,Fungicide: Arrests the growth of, or kills, fungi."
23,Other Uses Description,"An extract of the seeds inactivates the bacteria that causes black rot[20, 201]. Grows well with celery and other aromatic plants since these seem to deter insect predations[18, 20, 201]. Grows badly with beet, tomatoes, onions and strawberries[20, 201]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soil with plenty of lime[37, 200, 264]. Cauliflowers, especially the winter and spring maturing types, should not be given a soil that is too rich in nitrogen since this can encourage soft, sappy growth that is more susceptible to winter cold damage[264]. Prefers a heavy soil[16]. Requires a warm sunny position[16]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 to 7[200], though it tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 8.3. Succeeds in maritime gardens[200]. Lack of moisture in the growing season can cause the plant to produce small or deformed curds[264]. Summer varieties are not very cold hardy and will be damaged by light frosts, winter cauliflower plants are more hardy and will tolerate temperatures down to about -6°c, though the curds are more sensitive and can suffer damage at about -2°c[200]. This damage can often be prevented by bending over the leaves so that they cover the curd. Cauliflowers are widely grown for their edible immature flower heads (or curd). There are many named varieties and, by careful selection, it is possible to provide a year round supply. The summer and autumn maturing cultivars are annuals, they need to produce a certain number of leaves before curd development will be initiated. The optimum temperature for this is around 17°c, but at temperatures above 20°c the curds will either be of poor quality or not be produced at all[200]. Winter and spring maturing forms are biennial and need exposure to temperatures below 10°c before they will produce curds and once again, this will not happen unless the plant has reached a certain size[200]. Grows well with celery and other aromatic plants since these seem to deter insect predations[18, 20, 201]. Grows badly with beet, tomatoes, onions and strawberries[20, 201]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April to June depending on the cultivar. Plant out into their permanent position when the plants are 5 - 10cm tall. Seed of some cultivars can be sown in late winter in a greenhouse in order to obtain a harvest in early summer. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported."
