0,Iris pseudacorus,"Yellow Flag, Paleyellow iris",Iridaceae,5-8,"The leaves, and especially the rhizomes, of this species contain an irritating resinous substance called irisin. If ingested this can cause severe gastric disturbances[274]. Plants can cause skin irritations and allergies in some people[238].","Damp marshy areas, swampy woods and in shallow water or wet ground on the edges of rivers and ditches[17]. Often found in shady places[4].","Europe, including Britain, from Norway south and east to N. Africa the Caucasus and W. Asia.",(1 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Water Plants,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/IrisPseudacorus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/IrisPseudacorus2.jpg","Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect, Variable spread.","Iris pseudacorus is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, hoverflies. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can grow in water. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Meadow; Pond; Bog Garden;,,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"The seed is said to make an excellent coffee substitute as long as it is well roasted[2, 7, 61, 105, 115, 244]. Caution is advised, it might be poisonous[177].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cathartic  Emetic  Emmenagogue  OdontalgicThe fresh root is astringent, cathartic, emetic, emmenagogue and odontalgic[4, 7, 61]. A slice of the root held against an aching tooth is said to bring immediate relief[244]. It was at one time widely used as a powerful cathartic but is seldom used nowadays because of its extremely acrid nature[4]. It can also cause violent vomiting and diarrhoea[244]. When dried the root loses its acridity and then only acts as an astringent[4].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Ink: Plants that can be used as an ink.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","A beautiful yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[4]. A good black dye is obtained from the root if it is mixed with iron sulphate[4, 115]. It is brown otherwise[141]. The root is a source of tannin[61] and has been used in making ink[4]. A delicately scented essential oil, obtained from the roots, has been used to adulterate the oil of Acorus calamus[245].",,"Landscape Uses:Container, Specimen. Prefers a humus rich soil[79]. Succeeds in water up to 15cm deep[24]. Requires a moist soil, especially in early summer. Prefers a position in semi-shade[188]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A delicately scented essential oil is obtained from the dried roots[245]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[187].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[4]. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. A period of cold stratification improves germination time and rates. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division in March or October. Early autumn is best[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
