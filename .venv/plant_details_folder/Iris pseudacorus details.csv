Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cathartic  Emetic  Emmenagogue  OdontalgicThe fresh root is astringent, cathartic, emetic, emmenagogue and odontalgic[4, 7, 61]. A slice of the root held against an aching tooth is said to bring immediate relief[244]. It was at one time widely used as a powerful cathartic but is seldom used nowadays because of its extremely acrid nature[4]. It can also cause violent vomiting and diarrhoea[244]. When dried the root loses its acridity and then only acts as an astringent[4].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Ink: Plants that can be used as an ink.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Specimen. Prefers a humus rich soil[79]. Succeeds in water up to 15cm deep[24]. Requires a moist soil, especially in early summer. Prefers a position in semi-shade[188]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A delicately scented essential oil is obtained from the dried roots[245]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[187].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[4]. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. A period of cold stratification improves germination time and rates. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division in March or October. Early autumn is best[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
