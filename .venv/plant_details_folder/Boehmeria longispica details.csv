It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",B. spicata. (Thunb.)Thunb. Urtica japonica.

It is a sub-shrub, dying back to a woody rootstock in cold winters. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in a warm sandy soil[1] that is very well-drained[200]. We are not sure if this species is dioecious or monoecious[K].","Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse, only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
