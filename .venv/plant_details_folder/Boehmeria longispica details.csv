24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. It is a sub-shrub, dying back to a woody rootstock in cold winters. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in a warm sandy soil[1] that is very well-drained[200]. We are not sure if this species is dioecious or monoecious[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse, only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well."
