0,Cercis canadensis,"Redbud, Eastern redbud, Mexican redbud,Texas redbud",Fabaceae or Leguminosae,4-9,"The plant is reported to contain a toxic saponin[274]. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Rich woods, ravines and borders of streams[43, 82]. It often forms a distinct understorey in woodlands[229].","Eastern and Central N. America - New York to Florida, west to Texas and Wisconsin[222].",(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CercisCanadensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CercisCanadensis2.jpg","Bloom Color: Lavender, Pink, Purple.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Vase.","Cercis canadensis is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Flowers - raw[46, 61, 94, 183] or pickled[2, 105, 149]. A nice refreshing acid taste, the flowers are rich in vitamin C and make a pleasant addition to salads[183, K]. They can also be used as a condiment[200]. The unopened buds are pickled or used as a caper substitute[183]. On a zero moisture basis, the seed contains 22.9 - 27.5% protein, 7.7 - 8.8% fat and 3% ash[218]. (This report does not say if the seed is edible[K]). There is some evidence that both the young seed pods (eaten like snow peas) and the young leavescan be eaten.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Cancer  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Pectoral  Vitamin CA tea made from the inner bark is highly astringent[46, 61, 94, 149, 222]. Used in the treatment of fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery, it is also a folk remedy for leukaemia[222]. A cold infusion of the roots and inner bark have been used to treat various chest complaints including whooping cough and congestion[257].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The bark of young shoots is used in basket making[94, 106].  - heavy, hard, not strong, close grained, takes a very fine polish[82, 94]. It weighs 40lb per cubic foot[235].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Standard, Specimen, Street tree, Woodland garden. Succeeds in most soils and pH types, but dislikes growing in wet soils, especially when these are of clay[200]. Prefers a deep sandy loam and a very sunny position[11, 98, 182]. Succeeds in light shade[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. Although the dormant plant is cold-hardy, the young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A fast-growing but short-lived tree in the wild[229]. It does not flower freely in Britain[188]. There is at least one named form, selected for its ornamental value[188]. This spcies is the state tree of Oklahoma[274]. The flowers are produced on the branches of the previous or earlier years, and also on the trunk of the plant[82]. Plants are susceptible to coral spot fungus, especially when growing in areas with cooler summers where the wood is not fully ripened[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. A good bee plant[149]. Resents root disturbance, plants should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible, preferably in May, and should be kept well watered until established[11, 188]. This species is one of the few members of the family Leguminosae that do not fix atmospheric nitrogen[226].  Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Blooms are very showy. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 2. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water then cold stratify for 3 months[113]. Sow spring in the greenhouse[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted out in their permanent positions as soon as possible[11].
