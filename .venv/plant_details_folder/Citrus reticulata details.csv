13,Summary,"Mandarin (Citrus reticulata) is a widely cultivated fruit tree in many warm temperate to tropical areas. It is small and evergreen, and grows about 8 m tall. It has axillary thorns. The leaves are dark green, long, and narrow.  The flowers are star shaped and white. Mandarin fruits are reddish-orange in colour with resemblance to tangerines. However, it is smaller and oblate, the taste is less sour, sweeter and stronger, and its peel is very thin with very little mesocarp. It is eaten fresh, used in salads and desserts, or juiced. The peel is used fresh or dried and used as a spice. In traditional medicine, dried peel is used to improve digestion and reduce phlegm. For Chinese people, mandarins, along with tangerines, symbolizes abundance and good fortune. It is a part of their tradition that during Chinese New Year, mandarins and tangerines are used as decoration and given as gifts. In other countries such as Japan, Canada, the United States, and Russia, it is a Christmas tradition to give mandarins as gifts. Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Early winter, Late spring, Late winter, Mid spring, Mid winter. Form: Rounded."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiasthmatic  Anticholesterolemic  Antiemetic  Antiinflammatory  Antiscorbutic  Antiseptic  Antitussive  Aphrodisiac  Astringent  Carminative  Expectorant  Laxative  Miscellany  Stomachic  Tonic  Vitamin CCitrus species contain a wide range of active ingredients and research is still underway in finding uses for them. They are rich in vitamin C, flavonoids, acids and volatile oils. They also contain coumarins such as bergapten which sensitizes the skin to sunlight. Bergapten is sometimes added to tanning preparations since it promotes pigmentation in the skin, though it can cause dermatitis or allergic responses in some people[238]. Some of the plants more recent applications are as sources of anti-oxidants and chemical exfoliants in specialized cosmetics[238]. The fruit is antiemetic, aphrodisiac, astringent, laxative and tonic[240]. The flowers are stimulant[240]. The pericarp is analgesic, antiasthmatic, anticholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, antiscorbutic, antiseptic, antitussive, carminative, expectorant, stomachic[176]. It is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal distension, cough with profuse phlegm, hiccup and vomiting[176]. The endocarp is carminative and expectorant[176]. It is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal distension, coughs and profuse phlegm[176]. The unripened green exocarp is carminative and stomachic[176]. It is used in the treatment of pain in the chest and hypochondrium, gastro-intestinal distension, swelling of the liver and spleen and cirrhosis of the liver[176]. The seed is analgesic and carminative[176]. It is used in the treatment of hernia, lumbago, mastitis and pain or swellings of the testes[176]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise."
23,Other Uses Description,An essential oil from the peel is used as a food flavouring and also in perfumery and medicines[61]. Yields are around 0.5%[240]. An essential oil obtained from the leaves and young twigs is called 'petitgrain oil'. Yields are around 0.5%[240].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Espalier, Standard, Specimen. Three main climates are suitable for commercial citrus production - tropical climates, subtropical with winter rain such as in the Mediterranean and semitropical with summer rainfall as found in Florida and southern Brazil[ 200 ]. The optimal temperatures for citrus cultivation range between 25 - 30°c, with the coldest month having an average minimum of at least 15°c[ 200 ]. Growth generally ceases below 13°c and above 38°c[ 200 ]. If there are dry periods of more than three months, then irrigation will be necessary[ 200 ]. This species grows better in the subtropics than in the tropics[ 307 ]. Prefers a moderately heavy loam with a generous amount of compost and sand added plus a very sunny position[ 1 , 200 ]. Prefers a pH between 5 and 6[ 200 ]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.3 to 8.3. Plants are intolerant of water logging[ 3 ]. When growing plants in pots, a compost comprising equal quantities of loam and leafmould plus a little charcoal should produce good results[ 260 ]. Do not use manure since Citrus species dislike it[ 260 ]. When watering pot plants it is important to neither overwater or underwater since the plant will soon complain by turning yellow and dying. Water only when the compost is almost dry, but do not allow it to become completely dry[ 260 ]. There are many named varieties[ 183 , 301 ]. Plants dislike root disturbance and so should be placed into their permanent positions when young. If growing them in pots, great care must be exercised when potting them on into larger containers[ 238 ]. Special Features:Edible, Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown in containers as soon as it is ripe, after thoroughly rinsing it[ 164 , 200 ]. Sow stored seed in containers as soon as possible]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 13°c. Seedlings are liable to damp off so they must be watered with care and kept well ventilated. The seed is usually polyembryonic, two or more seedlings arise from each seed and they are genetically identical to the parent but they do not usually carry any virus that might be present in the parent plant[ 200 ]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 10cm or more tall before planting out into their permanent positions. Cuttings of half-ripe wood[ 200 ]. Layering."
