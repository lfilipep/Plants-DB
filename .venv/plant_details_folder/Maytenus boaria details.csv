The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

The soil should be well-drained but must not be allowed to dry out[200]. Requires a position sheltered from strong cold winds[188]. Tolerates temperatures down to about to about -10°c[200]. This species has a very wide natural range, so far all the introductions have come from Chile but provenances in Argentina might provide even hardier trees that could succeed in colder areas of the country[11]. Plants succeed outdoors in S. England and have produced self-sown seedlings at Lanarth in Cornwall[11]. Large mature trees are growing in woodland conditions at Hilliers Arboretum in Hampshire[K]. The flowers are usually either male or female, though both sexes are found on the same plant[219]. Occasional hermaphrodite flowers are produced[219]. Cattle are very strongly attracted to the leaves of this plant and will not touch other forage when this species is available[11]. A slow growing tree[200].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Division of suckers in the autumn or spring[188].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
