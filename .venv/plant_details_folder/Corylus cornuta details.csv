See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",C. rostrata.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[2, 62, 101]. Very popular in America, the seed is sweet and well-flavoured with a thin shell[2, 85]. The seed can be dried and ground into a powder which is added to cereals and used in making bread, pies etc[85, 183]. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed.","Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Odontalgic  StomachicAn infusion of the branches and leaves has been used in the treatment of heart complaints and intestinal disorders[257]. A decoction of the bark has been given to children to alleviate teething pain[257].,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs.

See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.","Young sucker shoots are used to make a rope[99]. The shoots are soaked in urine first, to make them more pliable[257]. A blue dye is obtained from the root or inner bark[99, 101]. The branches are used in basketry[160].",,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Specimen, Street tree. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, but is in general more productive of seeds when grown on soils of moderate fertility[11, 200]. It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.8 to 7.5. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. Plants are hardy to about -30°c[160]. They thrive in a short growing season[160]. This species is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed in N. America[61] but is of no value in Britain as a seed bearer[11]. Plants can bear fruit in 5 - 6 years from seed[160]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11].  Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in early spring. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
