It is in leaf all year, in flower in April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Flowers: ,,"Flowers - cooked[144]. Rich in pollen, they are often used in fritters.

A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. The extensive root system of this plant helps to prevent soil erosion[200]. The bark is rich in tannin[152].  - hard, dark, close grained, high quality, takes a high polish. Used for furniture, fittings etc[1, 4, 11, 154, 156, 167].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a sandy loam and a very sunny position[1]. Prefers a deep moist soil[167]. Succeeds in a hot dry position[166]. Succeeds in any good garden soil that is not excessively limey[11]. Most members of this genus become chlorotic on limey soils[200]. This is one of the hardier members of the genus, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[260]. It succeeds outdoors in Britain from Dorset westwards, also in south-western Scotland and in Ireland[1, 11]. However, even in the mildest areas of the country it is liable to be cut back to the ground in excessively cold winters though it can resprout from the base[11]. It is planted for timber in south-west Europe[50]. This species produces both phyllodes (basically a flattened stem that looks and acts like a leaf) and true leaves[1, 166]. The roots are very vigorous and extensive - they often produce suckers[260] and can damage the foundations of buildings[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.
