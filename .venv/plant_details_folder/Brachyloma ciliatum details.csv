See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a well-drained, humus-rich, neutral to acid soil and prefers a position in the dappled shade provided by an overhead canopy[200]. Succeeds in full sun if grown in a moist soil that does not dry out in the summer, so long as there is some sort of protection from the sun at the roots (a ground cover plant for example)[200]. The plant thrives in a poor soil so long as it is of sufficiently open nature to allow the roots to spread widely in their search for nutrients[200]. Plants do not respond well to fertilizers[200]. Plants are not very frost-hardy, tolerating only light frosts[200]. They can possibly be grown outdoors in the mildest areas of the country if given the protection of a wall, but in general they will need to be grown in a greenhouse[200]. Uncommon in cultivation, largely due to the difficulties in propagating the plant[200]. 193148","Seed - probably best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Germination is difficult and unreliable. If seedlings are obtained, then prick them out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer and consider giving some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. The plant becomes woody very quickly, making it difficult to find material for cuttings[200]. Where possible, take cuttings of firm young tip growths. They can take several months to form their fine and delicate roots[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
