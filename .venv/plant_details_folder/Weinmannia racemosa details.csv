The berries are not edible according to Crowe, the main authority on New Zealand edibles,see page 165 A field Guide to the Native edible plants of New Zealand 1997 edition. He says the error probably started with Sturtevant getting confused with Tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa, one of the best N.Z edibles I think, if you can adjust to fruit tasting like potato)which has a similar Maori name.He does not however say it is poisonous and it is not listed anywhere as poisonous as far as I can see.It was however very valuable to Maori for other uses above and bark was once exported for very high tannin content.

Prick the seedlings out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse for at least the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give some protection for its first winter outdoors.
