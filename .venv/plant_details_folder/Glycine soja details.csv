The immature seed is cooked and used like peas or eaten raw in salads[105, 183]. The strongly roasted and ground seeds are used as a coffee substitute[183]. The young seedpods are cooked and used like French beans[116, 183]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. It is cooked or used as a dressing in salads etc[34, 183]. Young leaves - raw or cooked[179, 183].",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Laxative  Ophthalmic  Resolvent  StomachicThe fermented seed is weakly diaphoretic and stomachic[176]. It is used in the treatment of colds, fevers and headaches, insomnia, irritability and a stuffy sensation in the chest[176]. The bruised leaves are applied to snakebite[218]. The flowers are used in the treatment of blindness and opacity of the cornea[218]. The ashes of the stems are applied to granular haemorrhoids or fungus growths on the anus[218]. The immature seedpods are chewed to a pulp and applied to corneal and smallpox ulcers[218]. The seed is antidote[218]. It is considered to be specific for the healthy functioning of bowels, heart, kidney, liver and stomach[218]. The seed sprouts are constructive, laxative and resolvent[218]. They are used in the treatment of oedema, dysuria, chest fullness, decreased perspiration, the initial stages of flu and arthralgia[176]. A decoction of the bark is astringent[240]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Glycine soja Wild Soya Bean for raised blood levels & cholesterol (see [302] for critics of commission E).",

23,Other Uses Description,"The seed contains up to 20% of an edible semi-drying oil[171]. It is non-drying according to another report[57]. This oil has a very wide range of applications and is commonly used in the chemical industry[171, 206]. It is used in making soap, plastics, paints etc[34, 46, 100].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich soil and a sunny position[33, 38]. Prefers a well-drained sandy soil[1]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[200, 206]. Does not grow well in a wet climate[132]. This is the wild ancestor of the cultivated soya bean and is of potential value as a genetic resource, especially when trying to breed for increased yields. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Seed can be purchased that has been treated with this rhizobium, it is unnecessary on soils with a pH below 5.5 but can be helpful on other soils[206]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a greenhouse. The seed should germinate within two weeks at a temperature between 12 - 16°c[206]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seed can also be pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in situ in late spring, though this will not yield well unless the summer is very hot.",
