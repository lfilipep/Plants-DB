24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary rich garden soils so long as they are well-drained[1]. Succeeds in dry soils. Prefers a position in full sun[188]. Although very cold hardy, this species does not like winter wet and therefore is best given some protection in the winter or a position such as at the foot of a dry wall[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring. Alternatively, the seed can be sown in early summer in a greenhouse, the seedlings overwintered in the greenhouse and then planted out in the following spring[1]. Division in autumn[111]. Cuttings can be taken throughout the growing season, though August/September is best[1]."
