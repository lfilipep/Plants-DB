23,Other Uses Description,Succeeds as a hedge in mild maritime areas if it is not in too exposed a position[K]. It is very tolerant of clipping.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any reasonably good soil[1] but prefers a moderately fertile well-drained loam in a sunny position[11, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it does not succeed outside the milder areas of Britain[3] but when fully dormant it is hardy to -10°c in warm maritime gardens[184, 200]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. This species grows well in Cornwall where it often self-sows[11, 49, 59, 166]. Plants are fairly tolerant of maritime exposure but they dislike cold drying winds[49, 166] and flower best when growing in a sheltered position. The leaves are very aromatic[188]. The fragrant white flowers are borne in great profusion[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in late winter in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn and overwinter in a cold frame. Plant out in late spring. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, November in a shaded and frost free frame. Plant out in late spring or early autumn. High percentage[78]. Layering."
