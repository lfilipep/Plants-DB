See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It is in leaf all year, in flower in July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Neopanax arboreum. (Murray.)Allan. Nothopanax arboreum.

Not very hardy in Britain, plants tolerate temperatures down to about -5°c provided they are in a warm sheltered location[200]. Whilst they can succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of the country, they are not hardy at Kew[11]. Plants often start out life as epiphytes on the stems of tree ferns, eventually rooting into the ground[11]. Large plants respond well to heavy pruning and careful transplanting[200]. Plants have three distinctive forms of foliage at different stages in their life-cycles, the second stage, as a sapling, is often the most interesting[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown when ripe in the autumn in a warm greenhouse[200]. The seed can be slow to germinate. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].
