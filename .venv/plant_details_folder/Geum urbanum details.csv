21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antiinflammatory  Antiseptic  Aromatic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  Skin  Stomachic  Styptic  TonicWood avens is an astringent herb, used principally to treat problems affecting the mouth, throat and gastro-intestinal tract. It tightens up soft gums, heals mouth ulcers, makes a good gargle for infections of the pharynx and larynx, and reduces irritation of the stomach and gut[254]. All parts of the plant, but especially the root, are anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic, febrifuge, stomachic, styptic and tonic[4, 9, 21, 165, 238]. An infusion is taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, intestinal disorders, stomach upsets, irritable bowel syndrome and liver disorders, it is also applied externally as a wash to haemorrhoids, vaginal discharges etc[238, 254] and to treat various skin afflictions - it is said to remove spots, freckles and eruptions from the face[4, 9]. The root is best harvested in the spring, since at this time it is most fragrant[4]. Much of the fragrance can be lost on drying, so the root should be dried with great care then stored in a cool dry place in an airtight container, being sliced and powdered only when required for use[4]. The powdered root had a great reputation as a substitute for quinine in the treatment of intermittent fevers [301]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any moderately good garden soil that is well-drained[1]. Prefers shade[12, 21] and a soil rich in organic matter[200]. This species was widely cultivated as a pot-herb in the 16th century[5]. The bruised or dried root is pleasantly aromatic with a clove-like fragrance[245]. Plants self-sow freely when well-sited[238]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer' Division in spring or autumn. This should be done every 3 - 4 years in order to maintain the vigour of the plant[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
