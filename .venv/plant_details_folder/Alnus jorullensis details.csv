13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Alnus jorullensis is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The flowers are pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

20,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Alnus jorullensis is an early successional species that regenerates and colonizes on open disturbed ground where other forest types have been destroyed though natural processes, such as landslides, or as a result of anthropogenic activities. It is used extensively in reforestation on disturbed sites and is widely grown in plantations throughout MesoAmerica and South America as a timber and fuel wood species[338 ]. In agroforestry it is used in silvo-pastures to provide nitrogen for increasing forage availability and quality, to improve soil fertility, and it is grown in association with crops such as corn and beans, coffee and wild blackberries[338 ]. Other Uses: The wood and bark is rich in tannin, which is used to impart a red colour[331 , 338 ]. land guides select this species for marking new trails through the mountain forests. The red marks of the bark cut by their machetes re as effective as red paint in marking the way[331 ]. The wood is rather light and soft but firm, straight-grained, rather fine-textured, easy to work, tough and strong, finishes smoothly, is not durable in contact with the ground[331 ]. It is used for the manufacture of boxes for transporting vegetables, shoe trees, matchsticks, post poles, broom handles, domestic implements, plywood cores and particle board. It is also locally harvested for firewood, and charcoal production[338 ]. Used for ornamental planting in warm temperate areas such as southern California. Good for hedging and screening."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropAlnus jorullensis is a plant of tropical montane forests, where temperatures are cool, with abundant rainfall. They are also found in high-elevation, open, oak-pine and fir woodlands in Mexico[338 ]. Grows best in a sunny position, but is somewhat shade tolerant[310 ]. Prefers a heavy soil and a damp situation, but it succeeds in ordinary garden soil[11 ]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[11 ]. Tolerates very infertile sites[200 ]. The tree responds well to coppicing[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. Semi-deciduous in cool climates. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
