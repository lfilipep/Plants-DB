The tuber is anodyne, antibacterial, antispasmodic, hallucinogenic, nervine and sedative[9, 13, 238]. It is used internally as a sedative for insomnia and as a stimulant and painkiller, especially in painful menstruation, traumatic injury and lumbago[238]. It is also used for lowering the blood pressure[9, 13]. Research suggests that it also has an action in the thyroid and adrenal cortex[238].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist, well-drained rather light soil, thriving in semi-shade. Grows well in a woodland garden or peat bed. Increases well when grown in a bulb frame, but less freely when grown in the garden[90]. A very ornamental[1] and easily grown plant[129]. There are some named varieties[90]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, the seed rapidly loses viability if it is allowed to become dry[129]. Surface sow and keep moist, it usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. Germinates in spring according to another report[129]. Two months warm, then a cold stratification improves the germination of stored seed[134, 164]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be allowed to grow undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Apply liquid feed at intervals during their growing season to ensure they are well fed. The seedlings only produce one leaf in their first year of growth[175] and are very prone to damping off[129]. Divide the seedlings into individual pots once they have become dormant and grow them on in a partially shaded area of a greenhouse for at least another year. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant. Division after flowering.",
