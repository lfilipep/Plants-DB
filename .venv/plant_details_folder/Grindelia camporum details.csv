Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiasthmatic  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Eczema  Expectorant  Homeopathy  SedativeGumplant was used by the native North American Indians to treat bronchial problems and also skin afflictions such as reactions to poison ivy[254]. It is still used in modern herbalism where it is valued especially as a treatment for bronchial asthma and for states where phlegm in the airways impedes respiration[254]. In addition, it is believed to desensitize the nerve endings in the bronchial tree and slow the heart rate, thus leading to easier breathing[254]. The herb is contraindicated for patients with kidney or heart complaints[254]. The dried leaves and flowering tops are antiasthmatic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, expectorant and sedative[4, 61, 165, 238]. The principal use of this herb is in the treatment of bronchial catarrh, especially when there is an asthmatic tendency, it is also used to treat whooping cough and cystitis[4, 61, 238]. The active principle is excreted from the kidneys, and this sometimes produces signs of renal irritation[4, 238]. Externally, the plant is used to treat burns, poison ivy rash, dermatitis, eczema and skin eruptions[61, 238]. The plant is harvested when in full bloom and can be used fresh as a poultice or dried for infusions etc[238]. A homeopathic remedy is prepared from the leaves and flowering stems[4].",
