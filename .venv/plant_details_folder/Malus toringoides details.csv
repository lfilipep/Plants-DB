1,Common Name,Cutleaf crab apple
2,Family,Rosaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. About 15mm in diameter[200]. The fruit is abundantly produced and hangs on the tree well into winter[200]. The flavour improves when the fruit has been frosted, so it is best to delay harvesting as long as possible[K]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], the fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. This species is closely related to M. transitoria[200]. It hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11]."
