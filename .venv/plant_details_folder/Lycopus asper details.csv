24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. This species is often confused with L. lucidus[60]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Tolerates most soil types so long as they are wet. Succeeds in damp meadows or in wet places by ponds or streams[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame[238]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring or autumn[238]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
