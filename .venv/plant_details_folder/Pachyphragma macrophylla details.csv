24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a leafy soil and a damp shady position[187, 200]. Another report says that it succeeds in dry soils and, once established, tolerates drought[190]. Succeeds in heavy clays[200]. Very shade tolerant[200]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. Possibly hardy to about -15°c[187, 200]. Plants have persistent basal rosettes[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow autumn in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in late spring[200]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
