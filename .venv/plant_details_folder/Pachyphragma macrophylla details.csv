Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Thlaspi macrophyllum,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover;,Leaves: ,,It would be worthwhile trying out the leaves of this species for edibility.

The plants have persistent basal rosettes but only achieve full ground cover from mid or late spring until early winter each year[200].,,"Requires a leafy soil and a damp shady position[187, 200]. Another report says that it succeeds in dry soils and, once established, tolerates drought[190]. Succeeds in heavy clays[200]. Very shade tolerant[200]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. Possibly hardy to about -15°c[187, 200]. Plants have persistent basal rosettes[200].","Seed - sow autumn in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in late spring[200]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
