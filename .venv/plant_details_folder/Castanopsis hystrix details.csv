24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors at least in the milder parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a good deep medium to stiff loam[1]. Requires a sheltered position in semi-shade and a lime-free soil[138]. Although cold hardy in Britain, this species really requires a warm continental climate if it is to prosper and it does not do well in the maritime climate of this country[200]. The seed takes two growing seasons from fertilization to maturity[266]. The catkins have an unpleasant hawthorn-like smell to attract midges for their pollination[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[138]. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out. It can be stored for a few months if kept cool and moist (putting it in a plastic bag that is placed in the salad compartment of a fridge works well). Stored seed should be soaked in warm water for 24 - 48 hours prior to sowing[138]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in mid summer if possible, otherwise grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring. Give the young plants some protection from cold for their first few winters outdoors.",
