24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in a warm sunny site in any freely draining moderately fertile soil[200]. This species is probably hardy in the milder areas of the country[11]. Another report says that plants are cut back by temperatures below about -15°c but that they can regenerate freely from the base[200].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details on this species but would suggest that if ripe seed can be obtained it should be sown straight away in a cold greenhouse. Stored seed can be sown in late winter or early spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
