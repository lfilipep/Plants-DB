See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in September, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Althaea frutex.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","oung leaves - raw or cooked[2, 177, 179, 183]. A very mild flavour, though slightly on the tough side, they make an acceptable addition to the salad bowl[K]. A tea is made from the leaves[2, 177, 240] or the flowers[183]. Flowers - raw or cooked[74, 105, 183]. A mild flavour and mucilaginous texture, they are delightful in salads, both for looking at and for eating[K]. Root - it is edible but very fibrousy[144]. Mucilaginous, without very much flavour[144].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Styptic: An astringent that stops bleeding by contracting the blood vessels.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antiphlogistic  Antipruritic  Demulcent  Diuretic  Dysentery  Emollient  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Ophthalmic  Skin  Stomachic  StypticThe leaves are diuretic, expectorant and stomachic[218, 240]. A decoction of the flowers is diuretic, ophthalmic and stomachic[147, 178, 218]. It is also used in the treatment of itch and other skin diseases[240], dizziness and bloody stools accompanied by much gas[147]. The bark contains several medically active constituents, including mucilage, carotenoids, sesquiterpenes and anthocyanidins[279]. A decoction of the root bark is antiphlogistic, demulcent, emollient, febrifuge, haemostatic and vermifuge[218, 240]. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery, abdominal pain, leucorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea[240, 279] and dermaphytosis[147].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","A low quality fibre is obtained from the stems. It is used for making cordage and paper[74]. The seed contains about 25% oil[74]. No further details are given, but it is likely to be edible. A hair shampoo is made from the leaves[74]. A blue dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. This species is planted as a hedge in S. Europe[50].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Standard, Seashore, Specimen. Prefers a well-drained humus rich fertile soil in a sheltered position in full sun[200]. Succeeds in any soil of good or moderate quality[11]. Dislikes shade or badly drained soils[11]. Plants grow best with their roots in cool moist soil and their tops in a hot sunny position. This species is hardy to about -20°c[200] but plants only really succeed in the warmer counties of Britain because of their late flowering habit[184]. When planted in colder areas of the country, they will need protection for the first few winters[200]. The flowers only open in sunny weather[219]. Plants rarely require pruning[219], though they respond well to pruning and trimming and this is best carried out in the spring or just after flowering[219]. Plants are late coming into leaf, usually around the end of May or early June[182]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[182]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Blooms are very showy. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Some reports say that the seed can be sown in situ outside and that it gives a good rate of germination[78, 80, 113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, early autumn in a frame. Good percentage[113]. Layering in mid summer to early autumn[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
