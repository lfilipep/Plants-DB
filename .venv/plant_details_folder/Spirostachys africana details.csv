The trunk is straight and bark is gray-black and rough. The leaves are small and narrowly oval, with rounded teeth along the edge. The flowers are dioecious, occurring in long groups. The fruits are small capsules with rounded seeds. The plant yields latex with medicinal properties specifically against toothache.

The wood, known as tamboti, tambotie, tambootie, or tambuti, is hard and durable, and used for furniture-making, carving, and crafts. It is not suitable for fuel because the smoke is toxic.",

A beautifully figured and very ornamental wood, it is much sought after for furniture making and is a very popular material for traditional carving and making local crafts such as beads and decorative sticks[295 , 308 , 775 ]. It has been suggested that this may have been the 'algum' wood from 'Ophir' as used in King Solomon?s Palace and the Hebrew Temple[308 ]. The wood is not suitable as a fuel because the smoke is toxic; it will also cause diarrhoea if food is roasted on the wood and then eaten[295 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,

Succeeds in a wide range of soils[295 ]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[295 ]. A very slow-growing tree[295 ]. The seeds often become infested with the larvae of a small grey moth which cause the seeds to spring several centimeters into the air similar to the 'jumping beans' of some South American Hippomaneae (Sebastiania spp., Colliguaya spp.)[308 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it needs to be harvested before being fully ripe because otherwise most of the seeds will be parasitized[295 ]. Surface sow the seed in a nursery seedbed or containers, pushing it gently into the top of the compost and do not allow it to become to dry[295 ].",
