Leave the fruit on the shrub until the last minute, as the fruit is very acidic and will not ripen after being picked. When ripe they make an excellent berry for cooking or eating fresh. Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.","Vaccinium corymbosum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 43, 62, 161]. It is usually sweet and juicy, though the flavour can be variable[11]. It can be used in pies, pastries, cereals, jellies etc[183]. The fruit can also be dried and used like raisins[183]. The fruit is rich in vitamin C[201]. The fruit is about 15mm in diameter[200]. A tea is made from the leaves and dried fruit[101].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Requires a moist but freely-draining lime free soil, preferring one that is rich in peat or a light loamy soil with added leaf-mould[11, 200]. Prefers a very acid soil with a pH in the range of 4.5 to 6, plants soon become chlorotic when lime is present. Succeeds in full sun or light shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[200]. Requires shelter from strong winds[200]. Hardy to about -25°c[184]. Often cultivated for its edible fruit in America[183], it is the most common and successful blueberry to be cultivated in Britain[11]. There are many named varieties[183]. A very variable plant, it usually blossoms freely in Britain[11]. Plants are at least partially self-sterile, more than one variety is required in order to obtain good yields of fruit[182]. Dislikes root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots until being planted out in their permanent positions[200]. leave the fruit on the shrub until the last minute, as the fruit is very acidic and will not ripen after being picked. Does not grow well with blackberries or raspberries[201]. Closely related to V. atrococcum and V. virgatum[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Edible, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].","Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse in a lime-free potting mix and only just cover the seed[78]. Stored seed might require a period of up to 3 months cold stratification[113]. Another report says that it is best to sow the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe[200]. Once they are about 5cm tall, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of greenwood, May/June in a shady position in a compost that contains some peat[113]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame[78]. Slow and difficult. Cuttings of mature wood, harvested in November and stored in a fridge then planted in a frame in March. Layering in late summer or early autumn[78]. Another report says that spring is the best time to layer[200]. Takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in spring or early autumn[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
