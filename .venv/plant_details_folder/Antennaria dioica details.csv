13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Antennaria dioica is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in) by 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Apomictic (reproduce by seeds formed without sexual fusion). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antitussive  Astringent  Cholagogue  Diuretic  EmollientCatsfoot has been little used in herbal medicine though it was once used in mixtures for the treatment of bronchitis and bilious conditions[268]. The whole plant is antitussive, astringent, cholagogue, discutient, diuretic and emollient[4, 7, 9, 21]. The plant is very rich in mucilage which makes it very valuable in the treatment of chest complaints[7]. It is also used in the treatment of liver and gall bladder complaints, hepatitis and diarrhoea[238]. Externally it is used as a gargle for treating tonsillitis and as a douche for vaginitis[238]. The herb is gathered in May before it comes into flower and can be dried for later use[7].",
20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,"A good ground cover plant for sunny positions. Rather slow to spread, however, and it requires weeding for at least the first year[197]. Plants form a carpet and root as they spread[208].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light well-drained soil in full sun, succeeding in poor soils[1, 133, 200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. This species is very susceptible to slug damage, the young growth in spring is particularly at risk[K]. Tolerates light treading[200]. The flowers are sometimes cut and used as 'everlasting flowers' since they dry well and keep their colour[7]. Plants are usually dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Some male plants have a few hermaphrodite flowers, though these are usually sterile. Apomictic flowers are also produced[17], these produce seed without sexual fertilization, each seedling being a clone of the parent plant. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 4. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in cold frame and only just cover the seed. Do not allow the soil to dry out. The seed germinates in 1 -2 months at 15°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. Division in spring or autumn. Fairly easy, the divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
