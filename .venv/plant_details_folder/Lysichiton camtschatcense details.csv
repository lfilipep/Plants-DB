24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a wet or damp humus-rich soil in full sun or semi-shade[200]. Grows well by water or in the bog garden[1]. Succeeds in shallow water. Hardy to about -15°c[200] Young plants require protection from slugs[187]. Plants are slow to establish at first, taking some years, but they can then become naturalized and self-sow[208]. The flowers are sweetly scented according to one report[187], whilst another says that the plant emits an unpleasant animal smell[245]. Hybridizes with L. americanus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in pots in a cold frame[134]. Keep very moist, preferably by emmersing the pot in 2 -3 cm of water[200]. Germination is usually good, taking place within 1 - 2 months at 15°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in trays of water in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in the middle of autumn or mid to late winter, but no later than this because the plant will be coming into growth.",
