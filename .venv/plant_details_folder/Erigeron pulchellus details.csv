17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Ground Cover. Invertebrates shelter: beneficial for insects and other arthropods. Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. Locations: Cottage gardens, butterfly gardens, native plant/wildflower gardens, meadows or naturalized areas. May be used in borders and rock gardens [368-1]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A perennial herbaceous wildflower. Dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates light shade, heat and humidity. Good drainage is very important. Best in poor to modest soils which have not been fertilized. Plants usually perform poorly in rich soils. [368-1]. Will naturalize in optimum growing conditions by self-seeding and stoloniferous spread. Flowers: Showy. Flower Color: White. Flower Time: Late spring or early summer. No serious insect or disease problems. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Propagate by seed, division or cuttings. Seeds: sow outside in late fall or the following spring without any cold treatment. Poor germination. Seeds require light for germination. Division - very good. Will naturalize in optimum growing conditions by self-seeding and stoloniferous spread."
