0,Tamarix gallica,"Manna Plant, French tamarisk",Tamaricaceae,4-8,None known,"Damp ground near the coast[17, 100].",W. Europe - France. Naturalized in Britain[17].,(1 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/TamarixGallica.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/TamarixGallica2.jpg",,"Tamarix gallica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.","na is produced by the plants in response to insect damage to the stems[2, 105]. It is sweet and mucilaginous[105]. There is some confusion over whether the manna is produced by the plant, or whether it is an exudation from the insects[4]. The insects in question live in the deserts around Israel, it is not known if the manna can be produced in Britain[K].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Detergent: A cleansing agent, used on wounds etc. It removes dead and diseased matter.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Detergent  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  LaxativeThe branchlets and the leaves are astringent and diuretic[7]. An external compress is applied to wounds to stop the bleeding[7]. The manna produced on the plant is detergent, expectorant and laxative[240]. Galls produced on the plant as a result of insect damage are astringent[240]. They are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery[240].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it makes a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens[7, 11, 49, 75]. It dislikes being trimmed[75]. The plant has a rather open habit, however, and so is not tremendously effective at reducing wind speeds[K]. The extensive root system of this plant makes it suitable for use in erosion control in sandy soils[149]. The plant contains a high level of tannin[7]. Galls produced on the plant as a result of insect damage contain up to 40% tannin[240]. The tannin can be used as a dyestuff for fabrics[7]. (No details are given about the colour, though it is likely to be some shade of brown.)  - fairly hard, not strong, close grained, takes a high polish, it is often twisted or knotty[61, 149, 227]. Used for general construction, poles, turnery[61, 149]. It makes a good fuel, burning well even when green due to the wax content of the wood[74].",,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant of saline conditions[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils as well as in sands and even shingle[182]. Usually found near the coast, it succeeds inland if given a fairly good deep loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerant of maritime winds and dry soils when grown near the coast[11], plants require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in non-saline soils because they use the soil salts that are found in saline soils to help them reduce transpiration[200]. This species flowers on the current year's growth[227]. Any pruning is best carried out in spring, hedges are also best trimmed at this time[188]. Plants are tolerant of severe pruning, sprouting freely from old wood[K]. The very closely related T. anglica is often included in this species. A good bee plant[74]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15 - 25cm long, planted outdoors in late autumn in a nursery bed or straight into their permanent position. High percentage[11, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
