Succeeds in most soils[187]. Requires a position that stays moist in the summer[187]. Plants grow best in areas with long hot summers[238]. A fairly hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -15°c[187] if given a deep dry mulch over the winter. A short lived plant, the bulbs are usually lifted in the autumn and stored in a cool but frost-free place over the winter, replanting them in the spring[233]. They can be left in the ground in the milder areas of the country so long as the soil is well-drained[233]. Individual flowers only live for one day, but the plant produces a succession of blooms over a period of several weeks[238]. Slugs really love this plant and can destroy even quite large clumps as they come into growth in the spring[K].  Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Pre-chill stored seed for 7 days and sow spring in a cold frame. The seed germinates in 2 - 8 weeks at 20°c[134]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. They can be planted out in early autumn and should flower in the following year[200]. Division in spring or early autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.,
