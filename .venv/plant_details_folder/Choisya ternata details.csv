It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

18,Edible Uses,"Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.",

23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as an informal hedge, they also respond well to clipping and so can be grown in a more formal manner[29].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires an open sunny but sheltered position[11]. Plants can be damaged by cold winds[219]. Plants grow equally well whether in full sun or in deep shade[202]. They succeed in most soils[202], but prefer a rather light loam[1, 11]. They require a well-drained soil, tolerating drought once established and atmospheric pollution[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], it usually survives very severe winters in Britain but can be damaged in spells of lesser cold, especially in the New Year[11]. Plants are normally undamaged at temperatures around -10°c but can be defoliated at -15°c[184]. Whole branches have a habit of dying for no apparent reason[182]. The Mexican orange flower is moderately fast growing when young, but it soon slows down with age[202]. The plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back to the ground if required[202]. Pruning is generally unnecessary for this species, apart from cutting out frost-damaged wood[219]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[188]. The flowers appear mainly in late spring[188, 219], but plants can produce a few flowers in the autumn[188]. They often also flower intermittently all through the summer[219]. The flowers are borne at the shoot tips[219]. The crushed foliage has a pungent aromatic scent of oranges[202, 245] and the flowers are sweetly fragrant with the powerful aroma of orange blossom[219, 245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm long, early July in gentle heat in individual pots in a frame[11, 78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, August in a frame. Good percentage. Plant out in spring[78].",
