See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Hedge;,,"Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Plants can be damaged by cold winds[219]. Plants grow equally well whether in full sun or in deep shade[202]. They succeed in most soils[202], but prefer a rather light loam[1, 11]. They require a well-drained soil, tolerating drought once established and atmospheric pollution[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], it usually survives very severe winters in Britain but can be damaged in spells of lesser cold, especially in the New Year[11]. Plants are normally undamaged at temperatures around -10°c but can be defoliated at -15°c[184]. Whole branches have a habit of dying for no apparent reason[182]. The Mexican orange flower is moderately fast growing when young, but it soon slows down with age[202]. The plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back to the ground if required[202]. Pruning is generally unnecessary for this species, apart from cutting out frost-damaged wood[219]. Some named forms have been selected for their ornamental value[188]. The flowers appear mainly in late spring[188, 219], but plants can produce a few flowers in the autumn[188]. They often also flower intermittently all through the summer[219]. The flowers are borne at the shoot tips[219]. The crushed foliage has a pungent aromatic scent of oranges[202, 245] and the flowers are sweetly fragrant with the powerful aroma of orange blossom[219, 245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm long, early July in gentle heat in individual pots in a frame[11, 78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, August in a frame. Good percentage. Plant out in spring[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
