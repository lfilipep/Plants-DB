America - Alaska to California.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Wet Soil,Water Plants,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Phyllospadix scouleri is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  It is in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from June to August. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). .  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  wet soil and can grow in water.",,Pond; Bog Garden;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - raw or cooked. Eaten in spring[61, 105, 118]. The entire plant, including the long salty-tasting leaves, were formed into square cakes and dried as a winter food by some native North American Indian tribes[256]. The leaves were occasionally cooked and eaten by some native North American Indian tribes[257].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it is hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. The main problem with this plant is that it is likely to require maritime conditions and possibly also periodic inundation in salt water, so it might not be possible to cultivate the plant under normal garden conditions. Plants of Phyllospadix grow attached to rocks, many of which are exposed at low tide. In summary Phyllospadix vegetation protects the rocky substrate from erosion, and by accumulating sand in and between the tussocks, transforms the rocky substrate into sandy beaches or sublittoral sand flats. Rejuvenation of the Phyllospadix vegetation, however, is then no longer possible on the sand-covered rocks. The plants eventually die, exposing the sand-covered rocks to wave action, which results in erosion of the sand, again exposing the rocks[270].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe if this is possible in a greenhouse and perhaps adding some salt to the soil. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
