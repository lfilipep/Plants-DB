It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - baked[173]. Pith of the trunk - dried and steamed until soft[173]. Sweet and starchy, it is used to make porridge or a sweet drink[173]. The root and stems are rich in fructose, the yields compare favourably with Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris altissima)[153]. Edible shoots - a cabbage substitute[105, 128, 173]. The leaves are very fibrous even when young, we would not fancy eating them[K]. Edible fruit[2, 105, 177]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The leaves contain saponins, but not in commercial quantities[153]. The leaves contain a strong fibre, used for making paper, twine, cloth, baskets, thatching, rain capes etc[1, 46, 61, 128, 153]. The whole leaves would be used for some of these applications. This species makes very strong rain capes[153]. The midrib of the leaves provides a fine red-coloured strip for plaiting. It makes a very strong rope, lasting longer in water than Phormium tenax[153]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good sandy loam rich in humus[1, 11]. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[188]. Likes a rich soil[11]. Plants grow well in coastal areas[260]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, they tolerate temperatures down to about -3°c[260] though one report says that they can survive occasional lows down to about -10°c[11]. They succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[11]. This species is more tender than C. australis[49, 59]. A very ornamental plant[1], it should be planted in its permanent position as soon as possible after the first winter[11]. Mice often kill young plants by eating out the pith of the stem[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for about 10 minutes in warm water and sow in late winter to early spring in a warm greenhouse[78, 164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 25°c[164]. There is usually a good percentage germination[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts and give the plants some protection in their first winter outdoors[K]. Stem cuttings - cut off the main stem just below the head and then saw off 5cm thick blocks of stem and place them 3cm deep in pure peat in a heated frame. Keep them moist until they are rooting well, then pot them up into individual pots. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts. Suckers. These are best removed in early spring and planted out in situ. Protect the division from wind and cold weather and do not allow the soil to become dry until the plant is established. Divisions can also be potted up and grown on until established, planting them out in the summer."
