18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - cooked. The starch can be extracted and used as an arrowroot[2, 46, 61]. The arrowroot is obtained by rasping the root to a pulp, then washing and straining to get rid of the fibres[2]. Very young tubers can be eaten cooked, they are sweet but fibrousy. One report suggests that the fruit may be edible but gives no further details[177]. As far as I know the fruit is a dry capsule[K].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep rich well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. The plant has large leaves and dislikes windy conditions since this can tear the leaves to shreds[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it succeeds outdoors in S. Devon[104], but even there it should be given a good protective mulch over the winter[1]. Plants can be grown as summer bedding in many parts of the country, the tubers can be dug up in the autumn after being lightly frosted. They can be stored over winter in a cool but frost-free place in moist soil or leaves[1]. Slugs love the young growth in spring and can cause serious damage to plants[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak for 24 hours in warm water and sow February/March in a warm greenhouse at 20°c[1, 138]. Plant the seeds 2 - 5cm deep in individual pots[1]. Scarifying the seed can speed germination, especially if the seed has not swollen after being soaked[124, K]. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 9 weeks[138]. Grow the plants on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of the root clump as the plant comes into growth in the spring. Each portion must have at least one growing point. Pot up the divisions and grow them on in the greenhouse until they are well established and then plant them out in the summer. Root cuttings.",
