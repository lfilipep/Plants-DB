See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.","Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 153, 183]. It can be somewhat constipating[173]. A resinous substance from the young branches has been used to make an alcoholic beverage resembling spruce beer[183]. The resin is bitter but edible[173]",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Much used for construction, railway sleepers, furniture etc[1, 11, 46, 61, 171].",,"Requires a light, freely draining soil in a sheltered position with protection from cold winds[164]. Requires high rainfall and humidity if it is to succeed. It tolerates shade and probably requires it in drier areas if the tree is to survive. Requires warm humid summers and mild humid winters if it is to grow well, and even then it is very slow growing[200]. It is best grown in a woodland garden[166]. This species is only hardy in the very mildest areas of the country and does not really thrive even there[1, 11]. A tree on the Scilly Isles was 9 metres tall in 1970[185]. Seed from a more alpine provenance might be more successful[81]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow spring in a freely draining compost[164]. It usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Another report says that the seed can be very slow to germinate and that it is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of short leading shoots in early autumn[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
