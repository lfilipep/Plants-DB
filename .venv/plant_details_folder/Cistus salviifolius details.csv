The form 'Prostratus' has been recommended[197].,,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Massing. Requires a sunny position in a dry or moist well-drained light sandy soil[11, 182]. Withstands drought once it is established[11, 184]. Tolerates maritime exposure[188]. Plants are hardy to about -12°c, but they require protection in severe winters[11]. Plants are somewhat hardier when grown in poor soils[182]. Individual flowers only last one day but there is a long succession of them[11, 200]. Dislikes pruning or root disturbance[200]. Plants should be pot grown and then planted out in their final positions whilst still small. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[108]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. This species is closely related to C. hirsutus[182].","Seed - gather when ripe and store dry[78]. Surface sow in late winter in a greenhouse[164]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 4 weeks at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle into individual pots. Grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out the in the following spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[164]. The seed stores for at least 3 years[K]. Cuttings of softish to half-ripe wood, 8cm long with a heel or at a node, June/August in a frame. Roots are formed within 3 weeks[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 8 - 12cm with a heel or at a node, September/October in a frame. High percentage[78]. Lift and pot up in the spring, plant out when a good root system has formed[78].
