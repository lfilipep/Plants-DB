See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

Small and red[183]. The fruit is a berry about 7mm in diameter[200]. Young buds (the report does not say if they are flower or leaf buds) are used to make a tea[177, 179, 183]. A bitter substance called quassin' is extracted from (the bark of?) the tree and can be used as a hop substitute in brewing beer[183].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiviral: Treats virus diseases,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth.

It increases the flow of gastric juices[279]. It is used in Korea in the treatment of digestive problems, especially chronic dyspepsia[279]. A decoction of the stem bark is bitter, febrifuge and tonic[46, 61, 146, 158, 174, 218, 240, 272]. The leaves have been used to treat itchy skins[240, 272].

Another report says that it is the wood that is used[240]. It is a substitute for the insecticide quassia, which is obtained from the wood of a tropical tree[240]. Quassia is a relatively safe organic insecticide that breaks down quickly and is of low toxicity to mammals. It has been used as a parasiticide to get rid of lice, fleas etc.  - hard, fine and close grained.

According to [200] this plant is only hardy to zone 10 (not tolerating frosts) but there are healthy trees in many parts of Britain including one 8.5 metres tall at Kew in 1981, one 8 metres tall seen growing in light woodland shade at Cambridge Botanical Gardens where it was bearing fruit in the autumn of 1996 and one 9 metres tall at Westonbirt in 1980[11, K].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as early in the year as possible. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long in December. Plant them out horizontally in pots in a greenhouse[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
