Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a greenhouse. Germination is often poor[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 15cm long, July/August in a frame[78]. Pot up in the autumn and overwinter in a cold frame. Plant out in late spring. High percentage[78] but very slow[11]. Cuttings of mature wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, November in a frame[78]. Plant out the following autumn[78, 200]. High percentage[78] but very slow[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
