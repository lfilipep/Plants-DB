19,Edible Uses Description,"eaves - raw or cooked[ 22 , 33 , 46 , 52 , 61 ]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[ 206 ]. The leaves can also be finely shredded and added to mixed salads[ 206 ]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[ 183 ]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[ 52 ]. Sweet and succulent[ 133 ]. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[ 1 , 2 , 17 , 57 , 183 ]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[ 74 ]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[ 171 ]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[ 183 ], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[ 238 ]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[ 238 ]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[ 238 ]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[ 238 ]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads."

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Originating from the central Asian Himalayas to China, the plant has long been cultivated and many forms have been developed that can be grown from the temperate to the tropical zones.

There are many named varieties[ 206 ]. A very fast growing variety, usually maturing within 40 days of sowing[ 206 ]. The plants in this group are fairly cold-tolerant[ 206 ]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[ 269 ]. A good bee plant[ 74 ]."
