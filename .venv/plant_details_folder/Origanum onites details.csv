19,Edible Uses Description,"eaLeaves - raw or cooked. They are used as a flavouring for salad dressings, vegetables and legumes and are best added in the final stages of cooking[183, 238]. A strong thyme-like aroma, the leaves are used as a substitute for oregano or marjoram, but they are inferior in flavour[183, 238]. A slightly bitter flavour, it is not nearly so sweet and delicate as O. majorana or O. vulgare[244]. Its flavour, however, lasts longer in cooked dishes[244]. A herb tea is made from the leaves[183]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rather dry, warm, well-drained soil, but is not fussy as to soil type[1, 18], thriving on chalk[1]. Prefers slightly alkaline conditions[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. Sometimes cultivated as a culinary herb. A good companion plant, improving the flavour of nearby plants[18, 20]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[108]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring at 10 - 13°c and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. The seed can also be sown in situ in late spring. Division in March or October. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings of young barren shoots in June. Very easy. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
