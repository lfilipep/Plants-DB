It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Astringent  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Haemostatic  Poultice  Women's complaintsA poultice of the inner cambium has been used in the treatment of serious cuts[257]. A poultice of the damp inner bark has been applied to the skin over a broken bone[257]. The shredded inner bark has been used as sanitary napkins to 'heal a woman's insides'[257]. A poultice of the bark and sap has been used in the treatment of bleeding wounds[257]. A decoction of the roots has been used in the treatment of dysentery[257]. A decoction of the branches has been taken by women for several months after giving birth in order to increase the blood flow[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].",
20,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Succeeds in wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11, 198]. The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making[199]. They have also been used to sew the bark on canoes and make hoops[226]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The roots have been used to make baskets[257]. The bark can be twisted into cord and used for making bags and clothes[257]. The branches and the bark can be twisted into a strong rope[257]. The bark has been used for sowing birch bark onto basket frames[257].  - light, soft, close-grained[82]. It has no commercial value, but it is used locally for fuel, charcoal and tool handles[229]. Dynamic accumulator.",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11, 198], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A fast-growing tree in its early years, this species is one of the few willows to naturally develop a single trunk[229]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
