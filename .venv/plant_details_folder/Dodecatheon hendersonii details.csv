Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in March or September. Autumn is best[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well.
