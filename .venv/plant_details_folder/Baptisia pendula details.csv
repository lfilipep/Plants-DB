22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen. Prefers a deep, well-drained neutral to slightly acid soil in full sun[200, 233]. Grows freely in a loamy soil[1]. Shy flowering in British gardens[1]. Plants have a very deep root system and dislike root disturbance, they should be left alone once they are established[188, 233]. This species might be no more than a synonym for Baptisia alba var. alba. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water and then sown in a cold frame in late winter or early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer or following spring. Division in spring[188]. Larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whilst smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well.
