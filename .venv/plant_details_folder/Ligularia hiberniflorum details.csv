24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it is only likely to succeed in the milder parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a deep moist or even boggy fertile humus-rich soil[200, 233]. Succeeds in sun or semi-shade[188]. Plants often wilt on bright windy days[200]. The young growth in spring is very susceptible to damage by slugs and snails[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
