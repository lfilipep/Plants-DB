The green canes are used and, the fact of their being green and the presence of the fluid within, seems to render the fire incapable of burning these wooden cooking-pots[439 ]. The bamboo casing also acts as a convenient container in which the cooked food can be carried whilst on journeys[633 ]. The internodes of 1-year-old culms are used as casings for 'khaao laam', a popular Thai dessert comprising a mixture of glutinous rice, adzuki beans, coconut milk, sugar and salt. After grilling or baking, the whole dish is eaten, including the bamboo casing, which adds a specific fragrance to the meal[301 ]. Young shoots - cooked[310 ].

Prefers a moist, but well-drained soil[310 ]. Bamboos have an interesting method of growth. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world[K ]. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. This species, however, flowers sporadically in most years, but does not then generally produce good seed[633 ]. It also flowers gregariously at intervals of several years, at which time good seed is usually produced[146 ].",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
