24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. However, judging by its native range, it is likely to succeed outdoors as a spring sown annual at least in the drier eastern areas of the country. The plant is likely to require a very well drained soil and a sunny position[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but would recommend sowing the seed in the spring. If you have sufficient seed, then an outdoor sowing in situ in late spring would probably work, otherwise sow the seed in pots in a greenhouse in early spring, pricking out the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and planting them out in late spring after the last expected frost[K].",
