22,Other Uses,"Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Fairly fast growing and tolerant of shearing, this species can be grown as a hedge[200]. A gum similar to 'gum arabic' (which is obtained from various Acacia species) is obtained from this plant[64]. It is not wholly soluble[64].  - too soft and perishable to be of economic value[154]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep rich moist soil[1]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it can succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[1, 11]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. A very ornamental plant[1]. The leaves are very variable[200]. A very variable species, closer investigation will probably reveal that it is comprised of a number of different species[265]. Some forms of this species produce suckers[157]. The plant has good wind-resistance[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Softwood cuttings in early summer root easily in a closed case[200]. Leafless stem cuttings in the summer root easily in a closed case[200]."
