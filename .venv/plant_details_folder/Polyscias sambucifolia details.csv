See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Panax sambucifolium. Nothopanax sambucifolium.

A gum similar to 'gum arabic' (which is obtained from various Acacia species) is obtained from this plant[64]. It is not wholly soluble[64].  - too soft and perishable to be of economic value[154].",,"Prefers a deep rich moist soil[1]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it can succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country[1, 11]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. A very ornamental plant[1]. The leaves are very variable[200]. A very variable species, closer investigation will probably reveal that it is comprised of a number of different species[265]. Some forms of this species produce suckers[157]. The plant has good wind-resistance[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Softwood cuttings in early summer root easily in a closed case[200]. Leafless stem cuttings in the summer root easily in a closed case[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
