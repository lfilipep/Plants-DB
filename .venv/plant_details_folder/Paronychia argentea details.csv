Closely related to P. capitata, but this species is more tolerant of winter cold and wet conditions[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200].",
