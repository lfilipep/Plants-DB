An interesting plant botanically because the true leaves have been modified into tendrils and the stipules have become leaves[100]. Plants climb by means of tendrils[188]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200]. In nature, most of the seed germinates in the autumn but many of the seedlings do not manage to survive the winter[17].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
