20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,The plant fixes atmospheric nitrogen and is used in seed mixes with grasses for land reclamation sowings[200].
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a moist, well-drained circum-neutral soil in full sun[200]. Succeeds in poor soils[200]. Grows well in a wild flower lawn[200]. It grows well in an apple orchard, the trees will produce tastier fruit that stores better[201]. It should not be grown with camellias or gooseberries because it harbours a mite that can cause fruit drop in the gooseberries and premature budding in the camellias[201]. The nectar-rich flowers are a good food source for bees and butterflies[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Buttercups growing nearby depress the growth of the nitrogen bacteria by means of a root exudate[201]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen."
24,Plant Propagation,Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in spring to early summer in situ.
