Severely damaged by low temperatures[1], this plant is not hardy in Britain but it can be grown as a half-hardy annual, flowering in its first year from seed[1, 200]. If grown as a shrub, it requires a minimum winter temperature of 5 - 7°c[200]. Plants stop growing when night-time temperatures fall below 5°c and are likely to be killed once the temperature falls below -2°c[260]. The plant turns its leaves and flowers so that it is always facing the sun during the day[4]. The flowers have a most unusual perfume, somewhat like cherries baked in a pie[245]. It is a good butterfly plant[24, 30]. A parent of the cultivated ornamental garden heliotropes[1], there are many named varieties[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 25 days at 20°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. High percentage. Because the plant is not hardy the cuttings would have to be grown in a greenhouse for the winter before planting them out in the spring. Cuttings of young shoots in the spring[1]. Because the plant is not hardy the cuttings would have to be grown in a greenhouse for the winter before planting them out in the spring.",
