26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it might be worthwhile sowing some in situ in April."
