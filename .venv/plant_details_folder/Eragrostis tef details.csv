Tef is cultivated for its seed in Ethiopia where it is a staple crop, there are many named varieties[46, 183]. It is occasionally cultivated for its seed in Europe[50] but is more commonly grown as an ornamental[1]. Plants can mature in 4 months from seed in warm climates[160], the crop is more problematic in Britain due to the cooler summers[K]. Plants tend to lodge[160].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse, only just covering the seed. Germination is usually very quick and free. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out after the last expected frosts. The seed can also be sown in situ in late April, but in cool summers this might not give a long enough growing season to ripen the crop[200].",
