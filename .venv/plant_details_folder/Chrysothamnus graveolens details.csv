21,Other Uses Description,"The plant is a source of latex, used in making rubber[1, 11]. Unfortunately the latex is not produced in sufficient quantity to make commercial utilization practical[K]. A green dye is obtained from the bark[168, 216, 257]. A yellow-gold dye is obtained from the flowers[168, 216, 257]. The stems are used in making wicker plaques[216]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position and prefers a well-drained sandy soil[1, 11]. Does not require a rich soil[11]. Tolerates alkaline soils[200]. A very variable and ornamental species[1, 11], it is not very hardy in Britain[11]. It can succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country but it requires the protection of a sunny wall at Kew[11]. The leaves and stems are pleasantly aromatic when crushed[219]. This species is considered by some botanists to be no more than a form of C. nauseosus[60]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse and only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200]."
