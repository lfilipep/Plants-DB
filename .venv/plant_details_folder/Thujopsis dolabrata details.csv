22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist sheltered site, preferably in or beside woodland[200]. Requires a high humidity but it is virtually unaffected by pH or winter temperatures[200]. A very slow growing plant in Britain[81], seedlings only grow about 3cm a year for the first 6 - 10 years and do not attain 30cm a year even when well established[185]. Unless shaded out by neighbouring trees, this plant retains its lower branches[81]. The sub-species T. dolobrata hondai. Mak. is a tall tree whilst T. dolobrata australis is a shrub or moderately sized tree[1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown when ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[113]. Stored seed germinates best if given a short cold stratification[113]. It can be sown in a cold frame in late winter. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. The plants make very little growth in their first year[78]. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If growing large quantities of plants, the seed can be sown in an outdoor seed bed in mid spring[78]. Grow the plants on for two years and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late autumn or early spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a shaded frame. Forms roots by the end of September but it should be overwintered in a frame[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood."
