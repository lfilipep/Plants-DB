This genus is closely related to Brodiaea and Nothoscordum species[1, 200].","Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe or February/March in a well-drained compost in the greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. Sow the seed thinly so that it can be grown on in the pot without disturbance for the first year, but apply an occasional liquid feed to ensure the plants do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs when they are dormant, putting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot, and grow them on in a cold frame for another 2 years[134] before planting them out in the autumn when they are dormant. Division of flowering size offsets in the autumn. They are freely produced[200]. The larger bulbs can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required, whilst it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year in a cold frame before planting them out in the autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
