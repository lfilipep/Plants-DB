This species is generally not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[184]. It is often cut back to the ground in winter but usually resprouts from the base[182]. It is, however, a very variable plant and there are some forms that are more reliably hardy[11, 200, 266] This plant has long been known in gardens, erroneously, as H. chinense[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 10°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 12 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Overwinter in a frame and plant out in the following spring[200]. Cuttings of mature wood, 12 - 17cm with a heel, October/November in a sheltered position outdoors. Plants root by the spring.
