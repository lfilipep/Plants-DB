0,Pittosporum tenuifolium,Tawhiwhi,Pittosporaceae,7-10,"This plant contains saponins[152, 154]. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans, and although they are fairly toxic to people they are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down if the food is thoroughly cooked for a long time. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Coastal to lower montane forests, North and South Islands, especially from North Cape and southwards[44].",New Zealand.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PittosporumTenuifolium.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PittosporumTenuifolium2.jpg",,"Pittosporum tenuifolium is an evergreen Tree growing to 7 m (23ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",P. mayi. Hort.

It is obtained by bruising the bark or by incision[128, 173].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","Very tolerant of trimming, plants can be grown as a formal or informal hedge in exposed maritime areas, though they do not stand extreme exposure[11, 75, 200]. When grown as a formal hedge it is best trimmed in spring, though this will mean that the plant will not produce many flowers[245]. A compromise is to only trim the hedge every other year[245].",,"Succeeds in most well-drained soils of reasonably good quality in full sun or light shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Fairly tolerant of maritime exposure[75, 182], but it can be killed by cold winds[184]. Hardy to about -10°c[184], it is tender outside the milder areas of Britain, but often self-sows when happy. Plants have reached a height of 9 metres in a sheltered position in eastern England[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200]. Very amenable to pruning, plants can be cut right back into old wood if required[200]. The species in this genus are very likely to hybridize with other members of the genus[200]. When growing a species from seed it is important to ensure that the seed either comes from a known wild source, or from isolated specimens in cultivation. Plants are widely cultivated for their foliage which lasts a long time in water and is used in flower arranging[11, 75]. The flowers are honey-scented[188]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow when ripe in the autumn or in late winter in a warm greenhouse[78, 200]. The seed usually germinates freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, move the plants to a cold frame as soon as they are established and plant out late in the following spring[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold during their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Poor to fair percentage[78]. Basal ripewood cuttings late autumn in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
