The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a moist, very well-drained neutral to slightly acid soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Succeeds in most soils, so long as they are well-drained[225]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure[200]. Somewhat intolerant of frost[200], this species is hardy at Kew but it prefers milder winters[11]. It does not succeed in the colder areas of the country[11]. Fruits are freely produced in Ireland[11]. Does well on a sunny ledge in the rock garden[11, 182]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200, 225], especially C. petriei[225]. There are several named forms, selected for their ornamental value[225]. Plants are normally dioecious, though in some species the plants produce a few flowers of the opposite sex before the main flowering and a few hermaphrodite flowers are sometimes produced[225]. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse or cold frame[K]. Sow stored seed in spring in a cold frame[200]. Germination can be slow, often taking more than 12 months even when fresh seed is used[K]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame.",
