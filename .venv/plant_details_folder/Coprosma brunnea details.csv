See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. brunnea. (Kirk.)Cheesem.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"Fruit - raw[128]. Sweet, but with little flavour[225]. The fruit is white or blue and up to 8mm long x 6mm wide[200, 225].

An excellent medium-height ground cover[200].",,"Requires a moist, very well-drained neutral to slightly acid soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Succeeds in most soils, so long as they are well-drained[225]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure[200]. Somewhat intolerant of frost[200], this species is hardy at Kew but it prefers milder winters[11]. It does not succeed in the colder areas of the country[11]. Fruits are freely produced in Ireland[11]. Does well on a sunny ledge in the rock garden[11, 182]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200, 225], especially C. petriei[225]. There are several named forms, selected for their ornamental value[225]. Plants are normally dioecious, though in some species the plants produce a few flowers of the opposite sex before the main flowering and a few hermaphrodite flowers are sometimes produced[225]. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required.","Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse or cold frame[K]. Sow stored seed in spring in a cold frame[200]. Germination can be slow, often taking more than 12 months even when fresh seed is used[K]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors[K].
