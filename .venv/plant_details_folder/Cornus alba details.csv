24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils and in dry soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Succeeds in poorly drained soils and so is suitable for streamside plantings[200]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[200]. A vigorous, fast-growing species, it is very ornamental, especially in the autumn and winterm with its fruit, autumn leaf colour and coloured stems[200]. For the best coloured stems, the plant should be cut back hard in the spring to about 5cm from the ground[200]. There are several named varieties, selected mainly for their variegated leaves or winter stem colour[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78]."
