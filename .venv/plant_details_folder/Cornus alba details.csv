See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden,,"Oil: Oil,Oil: ",e known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The seeds contain 30% oil, which is used industrially[266].",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils and in dry soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Succeeds in poorly drained soils and so is suitable for streamside plantings[200]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[200]. A vigorous, fast-growing species, it is very ornamental, especially in the autumn and winterm with its fruit, autumn leaf colour and coloured stems[200]. For the best coloured stems, the plant should be cut back hard in the spring to about 5cm from the ground[200]. There are several named varieties, selected mainly for their variegated leaves or winter stem colour[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
