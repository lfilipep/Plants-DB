13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Quercus cerris is a deciduous Tree growing to 35 m (114ft) by 25 m (82ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"- cooked. Up to 2.5cm long. It can be dried, ground into a powder and used as a thickening in stews etc or mixed with cereals for making bread[183]. The seed contains bitter tannins, these can be leached out by thoroughly washing the seed in running water though many minerals will also be lost. Either the whole seed can be used or the seed can be dried and ground it into a powder. It can take several days or even weeks to properly leach whole seeds, one method was to wrap them in a cloth bag and place them in a stream. Leaching the powder is quicker. A simple taste test can tell when the tannin has been leached. The traditional method of preparing the seed was to bury it in boggy ground overwinter. The germinating seed was dug up in the spring when it would have lost most of its astringency. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute. A sweet fluid exudes from insect damage on the stems and solidifies[2, 61, 105, 177]. This is edible and is sold as a manna in local markets in Iran[46]. It can be boiled down into a syrup and used for sweetening food[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  DysenteryAny galls produced on the tree are strongly astringent and can be used in the treatment of haemorrhages, chronic diarrhoea, dysentery etc[4].",
22,Other Uses,"Buttons: Plants that can be used as buttons. Not including making buttons from wood.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The seed cups are used as buttons[95]. A mulch of the leaves repels slugs, grubs etc, though fresh leaves should not be used as these can inhibit the growth of young plants[20]. Oak galls are excrescences that are sometimes produced in great numbers on the tree and are caused by the activity of the larvae of different insects. The insects live inside these galls, obtaining their nutrient therein. When the insect pupates and leaves, the gall can be used as a rich source of tannin, that can also be used as a dyestuff[4]. The leaves, bark and wood are used commercially as a source of tannins[223]. . It is valued by wheelwrights, turners and cabinet makers[4]. Of little value[1, 11]. It does not weather well[100].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good deep fertile loam which can be on the stiff side[1, 11]. Grows well on chalk[98], even when the soil is shallow[188]. Young plants tolerate reasonable levels of side shade[200]. Tolerates moderate exposure, surviving well but being somewhat stunted[200]. Grows well near the coast[98]. Intolerant of root disturbance, trees should be planted in their permanent positions whilst young[11]. A very ornamental tree[1], it grows very well in Britain and is the fastest growing of the oaks in cultivation in this country[1]. The seed ripens in its second year[200]. Trees transplant badly unless they are moved regularly[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it quickly loses viability if it is allowed to dry out. It can be stored moist and cool overwinter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees[11]. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being moved or they will transplant very badly.",
