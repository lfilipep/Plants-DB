24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a humus rich soil[13, 17]. Dog's mercury is a very invasive and common hedgerow plant, it should not be necessary to cultivate it. Male and female plants usually grow in separate clumps, the females being less common[4]. The leaves contain trimethylamine and, in the early stages of putrefaction or when bruised, they give off the smell of rotting fish[245]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - the plant shouldn't need any help in spreading itself, but if you are desperate to be completely overrun by it then you could spread the seed around when it is ripe in late spring and early summer. Division - once again, there really is no need to help the plant but you can divide the roots at any time of the year."
