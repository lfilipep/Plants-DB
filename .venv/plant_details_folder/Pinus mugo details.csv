Form: Oval, Prostrate, Pyramidal, Rounded, Spreading or horizontal.","Pinus mugo is an evergreen Tree growing to 4.5 m (14ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",P. montana.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiasthmatic  Balsamic  Cardiotonic  ExpectorantThe turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. The apical branches are antiasthmatic, balsamic, cardiotonic and expectorant[7, 61]. When distilled, the leaves and branches yield an essential oil that is commonly used in pharmaceutical balsamic preparations because of its antiseptic and expectorant qualities[7]. It is used internally and externally in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, chronic bronchitis, catarrh and asthma[238]. It is used externally to treat rheumatism and muscular stiffness[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. Trees are sometimes planted as a shelterbelt at high altitudes[185]. There are a number of dwarf forms that are very useful for covering dry slopes and mounds[11]. An essential oil obtained from the young twigs is used medicinally and also in woody perfumeries[7, 46, 61]. Trees are planted for sand binding and shelter in N. Europe[50]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc.  - used to make shoes etc[46, 61].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Christmas tree, Pest tolerant, Screen, Seashore, Specimen. Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. Thrives in the poorest of soils[11, 200]. Tolerates strong winds[81], including maritime exposure[200]. A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties[11]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[188]. Unlike most species of pine. this tree transplants well[11]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
