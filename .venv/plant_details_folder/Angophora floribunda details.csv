24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a moderately fertile well-drained moisture retentive circum-neutral soil[200]. Tolerates poor and dry soils, especially those low in mineral elements[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Plants are not very wind resistant[77]. Plants succeed outdoors in Britain only in the very mildest areas of the country[200]. They are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Trees lose their branches in high winds[157]. They shed their bark annually[167]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[156]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. If trying them outdoors, plant them out in early summer and give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth in sandy soil in a frame."
