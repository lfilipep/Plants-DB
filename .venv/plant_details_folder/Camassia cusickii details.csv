See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Quamasia cusickii (S.Watson) Coville,,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Bulb. The cooked bulb has a sweet, anise-squash flavour. Pressure cook at 250°F or 120°C for nine hours. A larger bulb than other species in this genus but the flavour is considered poorer [1-2]. Considered pungent, slimy, and bitter tasting by some (summitpost.org). The bitter taste is due to saponins in the plant. Commonly confused with C. quamash where Native Americans would harvest the roots to eat raw as a vegetables, or boiled them to create a sweet, molasses-like treat.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"Uses include food forests, informal gardens, cottage gardens, prairie and meadows. Locations include: garden banks and slopes, beds and borders and can be underplanted with roses and other shrubs. Showy, cut flowers. Thrives among perennials. C. cusickii can naturalize and serve as a good ground cover.",,"Hardy Perennial Bulb found in temperate to subtropical locations. Prefers moist, fertile soil in full sun to partial sunlight. Soil chalk, loam or sand which is acid, alkaline or neutral. It tolerates clay and dry soil. Soil moisture moist but well-drained. Unlike most bulbs, it prefers soil that has a bit more moisture but is intolerant of waterlogging. Deer- and rodent-resistant. Flowers spring to early summer. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 12 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat. The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1). For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a bulb.","Propagated by removing the offsets that have formed round the main bulbs. Plant 6 inches (150 mm) deep in late summer or early fall. In very cold areas, the soil should be mulched to protect the bulbs in late autumn.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
