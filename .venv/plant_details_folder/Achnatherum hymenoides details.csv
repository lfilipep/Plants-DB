Barkworth is a synonym of Oryzopsis hymenoides (Roem. & Schult.) Ricker ex Piper,"Achnatherum hymenoides is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Oryzopsis hymenoides (Roem. & Schult.) Ricker ex Piper. Eriocoma cuspidata Nutt.

The seeds are ground into a meal for bread and porridge.  They can also be used for cakes. They can be mixed with cornmeal and used for dumplings. [2, 46, 85, 106, 183]. The seed is rather small but when fully ripe it falls readily from the plant and is fairly easy to harvest[183]. Another report says that the seed is rather large[183], but this has not been our experience[K]. The seeds were parched over the flames of a fire in order to remove the hairs[213]. A pleasant taste and very nutritious[85, 183], it contains about 6% sugars and 20% starch[213]. Before corn was introduced to the area, this seed was at one time a staple food for some native North American Indian tribes[213]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It helps stabilize shifting sand. An important food for livestock and for wild grazers such as bison, desert bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, pronghorns, and jackrabbits.","New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","New Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbSucceeds in any moderately fertile moisture retentive soil in full sun[200]. This species is unlikely to tolerate temperatures lower than about -5°c, and so will only be suitable for the milder areas of the country[213]. Currently (1992) being tested for its potential as a perennial cereal for sandy soils in dry regions[183]. This plants roots are often surrounded by a rhizosheath that harbors nitrogen-fixing organisms[270]. These organisms probably contribute to the species' success as a colonizer[270]. Climate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: arid to humid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].","Seed - sow spring in situ[200]. We have had better results from sowing the seed in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed and it should germinate freely within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer[K]. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
