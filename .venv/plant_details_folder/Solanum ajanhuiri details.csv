17,Edible Parts,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,Root - cooked[177]. The tubers have a high content of dry matter and are a good source of vitamin C[196]. Most forms are bitter and are sweetened by being made into 'chuño' (a method of freeze-drying the tubers)[196]. There are some forms with sweet and floury tubers[196].,
20,Medicinal Uses,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1]. Dislikes wet or heavy clay soils[16, 37]. Prefers a slightly acid soil, the tubers are subject to scab on limy soils or those deficient in humus. Yields best on a fertile soil rich in organic matter. Tolerates hail and, once established, drought[196]. This plant is one of the S. American species of potatoes, it is possibly a hybrid S. stenototum x S. megistacrolobum[200]. It is more frost hardy than the common potato, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[196, 269], and can probably be grown in much the same way as potatoes are grown by planting out the tubers in spring and harvesting in the autumn[K]. It is cultivated for its tubers in the Andes, there are several forms but only one, called 'sisu' is not bitter - there are blue and white tuber varieties of this form[196]. Plants can produce tubers in 5 - 6 months from planting out[200]. Plants might have strict daylength requirements and may yield poorly in temperate zones because they need short-days in order to induce tuber-formation[196]. A diploid species, it rarely produces fertile seed and even then only in small quantities[196]. It is resistant to viral diseases and round-cyst nematode and is immune to Synchytrium black wart[196]. The tubers store well[196].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring in a warm greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into a fairly rich compost as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on fast. Plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division. Harvest the tubers in autumn after the top-growth has been cut back by frost. Store the tubers in a cool frost-free place overwinter and replant in April.,
