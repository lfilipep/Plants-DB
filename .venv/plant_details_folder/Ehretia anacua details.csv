See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from October to March, and the seeds ripen from October to March. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",E. elliptica.

Used for tool handles, yokes, axles, wheel spokes etc[46, 61, 82, 149].",,"Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained sandy loam in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates exposed positions[200]. Plants are shade tolerant in continental climates but they require more sun in maritime areas in order to ripen the wood[200]. Rich fertile soils encourage soft sappy growth which is then more susceptible to winter damage[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, but dormant plants have survived temperatures down to -13°c when growing in a suitable position. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Spreads by means of suckers[149].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Sow stored seed in late winter or early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Division of suckers in the growing season.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
