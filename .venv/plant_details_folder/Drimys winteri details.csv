24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a light lime-free soil in semi-shade[202]. Tolerates chalk in the soil[11]. Requires a deep moist soil[11]. Dislikes dry conditions[139]. Prefers a warm sandy loam with some shelter[1]. Fairly wind resistant[49, 166]. Another report says that the plant resents severe wind-chill[202]. Succeeds against a wall at Kew[K] and it thrives in an open position in S.W. England[11, 49, 59]. Tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c[184]. This species is less hardy than D. lanceolata but it usually recovers from damage[120]. Another report says that it is hardier than D. lanceolata[200]. A very ornamental plant[11]. The sub-species D. winteri andina. Reiche. is a slow growing dwarf form seldom exceeding 1 metre in height[182]. It usually commences flowering when about 30cm tall[238]. A polymorphic species[139]. The flowers have a delicate fragrance of jasmine, whilst the bark has a powerful aromatic smell[245]. This plant was a symbol of peace to the indigenous Indian tribes of S. America in much the same way as an olive branch was used in Greece[139]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on the plants for at least their first winter in a cold frame. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Layering in March/April. Takes 12 months[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Approximately 60% take[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth with a heel of older wood, November in a cold frame[78]."
