The plant has become popular as a herbal remedy in many parts of the world and considerable research has been carried out into the medically active compounds in the root. The most important active compounds in the root are a range of plant steroids and saponins; other compounds present include flavonoids[318 ]. The saponins have been shown to facilitate the body's absorption of other drugs and phytochemicals, which accounts for its history of use in herbal formulas as an agent for bioavailability and to enhancement the power and effect of other herbs[318 ]. Clinical research has validated the traditional use of sarsaparilla for skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, and leprosy. In one clinical study with 92 patients it was reported that use of the root improved psoriasis lesions in 62% of cases and completely cleared lesions in 18% of cases. The root's blood cleansing properties are believed to be largely responsible for this, and in particular the steroid sarsaponin, which has been shown to remove endotoxins from the blood[318 ]. Sarsaparilla's effective use in the treatment of leprosy has been documented in a 1959 human trial[318 ]. The effectiveness of sarsaparilla in the treatment of adolescent acne caused by excessive androgens has received some experimental support as well[318 ]. Flavonoids in sarsaparilla have been documented to have immune modulation and liver protective activities[318 ]. Clinical observations in China demonstrated that sarsaparilla was effective (according to blood tests) in about 90% of acute and 50% of chronic cases of syphilis[318 ]. Other studies have show the antibiotic, antifungal and antimycobacterial properties of the root[318 ]. Its anti-inflammatory activity has been demonstrated in several in vitro and in vivo studies[318 ]. The root has been reported to have stimulatory activity on the kidneys in humans and, in chronic nephritis, it was shown to increase the urinary excretion of uric acid[318 ]. Saponins and plant steroids found in many species of plants (including sarsaparilla) can be synthesized into human steroids such as oestrogen and testosterone. This synthesis has never been documented to occur in the human body - only in the laboratory[318 ]. The steroids sarsasapogenin and smilagenin have been claimed to have the ability to treat senile dementia, cognitive dysfunction, and Alzheimer's disease. Any studies to substantiate these claims, however, have not yet been published in peer-reviewed papers[318 ] In modern herbalism, the root is considered anodyne, antibacterial, antibiotic, antifungal, antiinflammatory, blood cleanser, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, digestive, febrifuge, hepatic and tonic[318 ]. Through its reputation as a blood cleanser, the root has had a long history of use for syphilis and other sexually-transmitted diseases throughout the world. It is also used in the treatment of conditions such as gout, syphilis, gonorrhoea, rheumatism, wounds, arthritis, fever, cough, scrofula, hypertension, digestive disorders, psoriasis, skin diseases, and cancer[318 ]. The root is also widely available in health food stores, with a variety of tablets, capsules, and tincture products sold today. It can be found, both on its own or as an ingredient in various herbal remedies, where it is recommended for skin disorders, libido enhancement, hormone balancing, and sports nutrition formulas. It's also commonly used in herbal preparations as a synergist or bioavailability aid - as it is thought that the saponins in sarsaparilla root increase the absorption of other chemicals in the gut[318 ].",Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,"Agroforestry Uses: The stems of many Smilax species are covered with prickles and, sometimes, these vines are cultivated to form impenetrable thickets (which are called catbriers or greenbriers)[318 ].
