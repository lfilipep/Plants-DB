Asia",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/GenistaTinctoria.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/GenistaTinctoria2.gif","Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Oval, Upright or erect.","Genista tinctoria is a deciduous Shrub growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Ground Cover; Meadow;,Leaves: ,"Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","ntThe seed has been suggested as a possible coffee substitute[177, 183]. The flower buds are pickled and used as a substitute for capers[2, 183]. Used as a vegetable[105].","Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vasoconstrictor: Narrows the blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cathartic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Homeopathy  Stimulant  VasoconstrictorThe twigs, leaves and flowering stems are cathartic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, stimulant and vasoconstrictor[4, 9, 21, 46]. The seeds are also sometimes used[4]. The plant is harvested in early summer as it comes into flower and can be dried for later use[9]. It should not be stored for more than 12 months since its active ingredients break down[238]. The powdered seeds act as a mild purgative and were at one time used to make a plaster for broken limbs[244]. A decoction of the whole plant has been used as a remedy for dropsy, rheumatism and gout[4, 9, 244]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh shoots[9]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism[9].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.","A very good quality yellow dye is obtained from the whole plant, but especially from the flowers and young shoots[4, 9, 11, 57, 66, 141, 169, 244]. It produces a very good quality green when mixed with woad (Isatis tinctoria)[11, 238]. Alum, cream of tartar and sulphate of lime are used to fix the colour[4]. The stems can be dried and stored until the dye is required[169]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for coarse cloth and cordage[4, 169]. Plants can be used as a ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. The cultivar 'Flore Pleno' is always dwarf and is more reliable than the species[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Erosion control, Foundation, Massing, Specimen. Easily grown in a light well-drained soil in a sunny position[1, 11]. Prefers a rather dry soil, tolerating poor and sandy soils[238]. Prefers a lime-free soil[244]. Succeeds in acid or basic soils. A very cold-tolerant plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -35°c[200]. Resents root disturbance and should only be transplanted whilst young[11, 169]. Sometimes cultivated as a dye plant, it is usually treated as a biennial for this purpose, the whole plant being harvested in the second year[141]. Plants do not require pruning, but they can be cut back as required once they have finished flowering in order to maintain shape[238]. Polymorphic, a number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. A good bee plant[20]. Rabbits love eating this plant[169, K]. Cows also eat the plant, but it taints their milk[4]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown autumn in a cold frame. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow February in a cold frame. Good germination[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Roots are formed in the spring[11]. Cuttings of ripe wood, 5 - 10 cm with a heel, September/October in a frame. Good percentage. Plant out the following autumn[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
