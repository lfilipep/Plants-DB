Senna siamea or most commonly known as Siamese Senna is native to South and Southeast Asia that grows up to 18 m in height with an erect and slender stem. It is commonly used as shade tree in plantations, as windbreak, or as hedgerows. The leaves are dark green, alternate, and pinnately compound. The yellow flowers occur at the end of branches. The fruits are black pods with thickened edges. The plant contains Barakol, a compound with sedative and anxiolytic effects, which contributes to its medicinal values. It is used against intestinal worms and scabies. Plant parts such as leaves, pods, and seeds are all edible but has to be thoroughly boiled first prior to eating. Flowers and young fruits are used in curries. The leaves are used as green manure. All plant parts can be used for tanning. The wood is used for joinery, cabinet making, inlaying, handles, sticks, and other decorative uses. In addition, it can be made into charcoal of excellent quality.","Senna siamea is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil.

It is also planted as a dense windbreak and shelterbelt[303 , 451 ]. It is pruned into hedgerows and used as a live fence around food crops[303 ]. When used as a hedgerow, it effectively increases topsoil infiltration, reducing runoff and combating soil erosion[303 ]. The leaves are used as green manure, and a well-grown tree can yield 500 kg/year of fresh leaves. S. Siamea forms ecto-mycorrhizae and provides very useful mulch, especially in alley-cropping systems[303 ]. It is used extensively for rehabilitation of degraded land, for example, to re-vegetate aluminium mine tailings[303 ]. Although not a nitrogen-fixing tree, it has been increasingly used in alley cropping systems, largely because of its coppicing ability and high biomass production[303 ]. In India, it is used as a host for sandalwood (Santalum spp.), a parasitic tree producing the well-known aromatic wood[303 ]. Other Uses All parts of the plant can be used for tanning. The concentrations of tannin vary slightly from 17% in the leaves to 9% in the bark and 7% in the fruits[303 ]. The heartwood is black-brown with paler streaks, sharply demarcated from the 6cm wide band of pale sapwood[303 ]. The grain is interlocked and occasionally straight; the texture is slightly coarse but even[303 ]. The wood is medium-weight to heavy, hard to very hard, resistant to termites, strong and durable[303 ]. It is difficult to work, with a tendency to pick up in planing and it takes a high polish[303 ]. The dark heartwood, which is often nicely figured, is used for joinery, cabinet making, inlaying, handles, sticks and other decorative uses[303 ]. The wood has also been used for poles, posts, bridges, mine poles and beams[303 ]. The dense wood makes good fuel, although it produces some smoke when burning[303 ]. The energy value of the wood is 22 400 kJ/kg[303 ]. The wood was formerly preferred for locomotive engines[303 ]. Its charcoal is also of excellent quality[303 ].","Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Agroforestry Services: Alley crop  Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Fodder: Bank  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropThe tree will grow in a range of climatic conditions, but is particularly suited to the lowland tropics with a monsoon climate, where it can succeed at elevations up to 1,300 metres[303 ]. It grows in areas where the mean annual rainfall ranges from 500 - 2,800 mm with an optimum of about 1,000 mm[303 ]. The maximum length of the dry period should not exceed 4 - 8 months[303 ]. Under semi-arid conditions (rainfall of 500 - 700 mm), it will only grow when its roots have access to groundwater[303 ]. It requires a mean minimum temperature of 20°c, ranging from 14 - 28°c, and a mean maximum temperature of 31°c, ranging from 24 - 36°c[303 ]. It is susceptible to cold and frost[303 ]. Requires a sunny position[303 ]. It grows best on deep, well-drained, fertile soils, but will succeed on degraded, lateritic soils provided drainage is not impeded[303 ]. It grows poorly on infertile, poorly drained podzolic soils[303 ]. It is not tolerant of salinity but is reasonably tolerant of acid soil conditions[303 ]. It prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5[303 ]. Trees grow fast even in comparatively infertile soils[303 ]. Seedling trees start flowering and fruiting at the age of 2 - 3 years[303 ]. Once established, they flower precociously and abundantly throughout the year[303 ]. Planting density varies according to use. In fuel wood plantations, spacing ranges from 1 x 1 metre to 1x 3 metres. In hedges used for alley cropping or as a shelterbelt, spacing between plants in the row should be 25 - 50 cm[303 ]. Trees respond well to coppicing[303 ]. For the production of fuel wood and charcoal, plantations are generally pollarded or regenerated by coppice leaving 2-3 shoots/stump after 1 year. It has been reported that sapwood should be removed as soon as possible after felling to prevent insect attack of the heartwood[303 ]. The root system consists of a few thick roots, growing to considerable depth, and a dense mat of rootlets in the top 10 - 20 cm of soil, which may reach a distance of 7 metres from the stem in 1 year and eventually a distance up to 15 metres[303 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[755 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Spring Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: Pale Yellow Bright Yellow. Spacing: 20-30 ft. (6-9 m).","Seed - requires pre-treatment to soften the hard seedcoat and allow the ingress of water[299 ]. This can be done by soaking the seed in a small amount of nearly boiling water (which cools down quickly and does not cook the seed) and then soaking the seed for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. Alternatively, a small area of the seed coat can be abraded, being careful not to damage the embryo[K ]. Germination of treated seed is about 90% within 60 days. Germination of untreated seeds is about 75% in 4 - 29 days[303 ]. The seed is usually sown in situ[303 ]. Seeds should be sown in areas with full sunlight, as the slightest shade reduces germination considerably[303 ]. Early seedling growth can be quite slow, reaching only 29 cm after 8 weeks of planting[303 ]. Storage behaviour is orthodox. Viability can be maintained for 3 years in hermetic storage at room temperature with 11-15% mc. There are 35 000-45 000 seeds/kg[303 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
