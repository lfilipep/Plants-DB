23,Other Uses Description,"Backyard tree. Large shade tree. Street tree. Large flowering tree, Public open space. Specimen. Other Uses The bark and the leaves are the source of a yellowish-brown dye used for silk[303 , 307 ]. The flowers are used to repel mosquitoes[307 ]. The slender branches are used as toothbrushes to treat toothache[272 ]. Heartwood is pale yellowish-brown to reddish-brown, darkening on exposure, not clearly demarcated from the pale yellowish-brown sapwood. Grain somewhat wavy, texture moderately coarse; freshly cut wood is scentless. The wood is used for many purposes, including indoor construction, meat-chopping blocks, furniture, carpentry, flooring, boxes, crates and boat building (canoes and dugouts)[303 ]. The wood is a source of 'machang' timber[895 ]. We do not have a specific description for the wood of this speices, but a general description of machang timber is as follows:- The heartwood is light brown or light grey brown, occasionally with chocolate or black streaky coreword; it is not clearly differentiated from the wide band of sapwood. The texture is moderately coarse to coarse and even; the grain interlocked and wavy. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; moderately hard; not durable under exposed conditions, being susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. The wood seasons somewhat rapidly with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It can be worked with ordinary tools, there is a slight difficulty resawing when green, but is easy when dry; planing is easy but the surface produced is moderately smooth with grain pick-up on the radial side; nailing and screwing is excellent; gluing is correct. The wood is suitable for light construction, turnery, flooring, interior panelling, boxes, crates, pallets and plywood manufacture[895 ]. Corewood can be used for decorative veneer production[848 , 895 ]. With a calorific value of 4200 kcal/kg, the wood makes excellent charcoal and firewood[303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"The optimal climate for growing mango ranges from the monsoon tropics to the frost-free subtropics, with a marked dry, or cool, season of at least three months to promote flowering[200 , 303 ]. It succeeds at any elevation up to about 1,200 metres, but for commercial purposes 600 metres is the maximum elevation[303 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 8 - 48°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive short-lived temperatures down to about -1°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 600 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 300 - 2,600mm[418 ]. The dry season of equatorial regions is too unreliable for commercial cultivation[200 ]. Whilst trees generally grow best in moderately dry climates, some cultivars can thrive and produce even under rainforest conditions[298 ]. Prefers a sunny position[307 ]. Plants are not too fussy over soil, not needing very fertile conditions[200 ]. However, they crop better in a rich, well-drained soil[307 ], whilst very poor soil, or shallow land, is unsuitable[200 ]. A pH in the range 6 - 7 is ideal[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.3 - 8.5[418 ]. Grows best in areas sheltered from strong, drying winds[418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant, and can also withstand occasional inundation of the soil[418 ]. Trees produce a taproot up to 5 metres deep[200 ]. Plants take 5 - 8 years from seed before they begin to fruit[296 ]. Grafted plants commence bearing in 3 - 5 years[335 ]. Individual trees often flower irregularly and may only produce one good crop every 3 - 4 year; some trees do not flower for periods of 10 - 20 years, sometimes even longer[303 , 418 ]. Yields increase up to the 20th year, decline after the 40th year and the tree may live for 100 years or more[418 ]. Flowering starts at the beginning of the rainy season and fruits ripen at the end of the rainy season[303 ]. Most varieties are self-fertile, but produce larger crops when cross-pollinated[335 ]. Yields of about 500 fruits per tree are average in 'on' years[200 ]. A plantation of full-grown trees may produce 10 - 30 tonnes per hectare of fruit each year. Average yields are, however, often quite low with 6 tonnes being achieved in the Philippines, 3.5 tonnes in Peninsular Malaysia and 2.3 tonnes in Thailand[418 ]. A very variable plant, there are many named varieties[200 , 296 ]. Some forms of the mango produce polyembryonic seeds (more than one seedling is produced from each seed) - these forms produce a tree genetically identical to the parent[296 ]. Flowering Time: Late Spring/Early Summer Mid Summer. Blooming Color: Red Pale Yellow White/Near White. Spacing: 30-40 ft. (9-12 m)."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe[200 ]. Wash the seed, dry in shade and sow about 5cm deep with the convex side up[200 ]. Germination takes about 18 days if the seed is peeled first, or 30 days if it is not[200 ]. Give the seedlings some shade as they grow[303 ]. Plants that are raised in nursery beds can be transplanted without much difficulty before the taproot has developed to any great extent[303 ]. However, seedlings raised in baskets or containers are preferable[303 ]. Grafting onto a polyembryonic stock[200 ]."
