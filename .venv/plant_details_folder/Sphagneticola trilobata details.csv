Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.A strong decoction of the whole plant is used to treat severe chest colds[348 ]. It is combined with Lantana camara, as a tea or syrup, as a remedy for colds[348 ]. The leaves are included in a cough and cold remedy along with the boiled leaves of Commelina nudiflora or Hibiscus sabdariffa, and sometime also Citrus aurantiifolia[348 ]. The plant contains acetylenes and derivatives of kaurenic acid[348 ]."
20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: An interesting ground cover plant for warm locations. The stems are brittle and break easily, so should be kept away from foot traffic[423 ]. The plant can tolerate light pedestrian traffic[200 ]. Other Uses: ornamental. It is one of the few ground cover plants that can survive central Arizona desert combination of extreme heat and sun at ground level."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moist tropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 700 metres[413 ]. A long-lived perennial herb with a creeping prostrate scrambling or climbing habit. This mat-forming stoloniferous plant often creates a dense ground cover (usually 15-30 cm tall but occasionally up to 70 cm tall) that crowds out the growth of other species. It may also climb a short distance up trees or over other vegetation.Plant tops can be killed by frosts, but the roots will survive at least some frost and regrow with warmer weather[423 ]. Succeeds in full sun to moderate shade, flowering more heavily in a sunny position[413 , 423 ]. Succeeds in most soil types[413 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil, but is very tolerant, succeeding in dry and moist conditions, tolerating inundation and withstanding drought[413 , 423 ]. The plant is very salt-resistant, growing well near the sea[413 , 423 ]. Often cultivated as an ornamental, the plant readily escapes from gardens and forms a dense ground cover, crowding out or preventing regeneration of other species. In plantations, it will compete with crops for nutrients, light and water, and reduce crop yields[413 ]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed, Division, Cuttings. Tip cuttings are very easy[423 ]."
