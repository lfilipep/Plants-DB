Hydrocarbon latex crops - Cnidoscolus elasticus, the source of highland Chilte, is an excellent rubber yielding tree from the states of Durango and Sinaloa, Mexico"
22,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: CoppiceClimate: tropical highlands. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. Very little information is avaialble. One of the areas it grows well is Durango and Sinaloa, Mexico. Durango is one of the coldest regions in Mexico with an average daily high temperature of only 28 degrees centigrade. Several months of the year it is warm to hot at temperatures continuously above 25 degrees centigrade, sometimes up to 34 degrees. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: experimental.
