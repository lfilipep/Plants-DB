Arctium lappa is the main species used, though this species has similar properties[254]. The dried root of one year old plants is the official herb, but the leaves and fruits can also be used[4]. It is used to treat conditions caused by an 'overload' of toxins, such as throat and other infections, boils, rashes and other skin problems[254]. The root is thought to be particularly good at helping to eliminate heavy metals from the body[254]. The plant is antibacterial, antifungal and carminative[9, 21, 147, 165, 176]. It has soothing, mucilaginous properties and is said to be one of the most certain cures for many types of skin diseases, burns, bruises etc[4, 244].

The leaves are poulticed onto burns, ulcers and sores[222].","Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.","A fibre is obtained from the inner bark and is used to make paper.

The fibres are then cooked for two hours in soda ash before being put in a ball mill for 2 hours[189].
