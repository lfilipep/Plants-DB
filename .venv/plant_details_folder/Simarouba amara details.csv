17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Oil: "
19,Edible Uses Description,"he seeds contain 60 - 75% edible oil that can be extracted by conventional methods. Each well-grown tree yields 15 to 30 Kg nutlets equivalent to 2.5-5 kg oil and about the same quantity of oilcake. This amounts to 1000-2000 kg oil/ha/year and about the same quantity of oilcake. The oil is largely used in the preparation of bakery products in Central America. In India too it can be used in the manufacture of vanaspati, vegetable oil and/or margarine. The oil is free from bad cholesterol[418 ]. The fruit pulp, rich in sugars (about 11%) can be used in the preparation of beverages[418 ]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antirheumatic  Antiviral  Astringent  Bitter  Cancer  Digestive  Dysentery  Emmenagogue  Febrifuge  Malaria  Parasiticide  TonicThe leaves and bark have a long history of medicinal use in the tropics, particularly in the treatment of malaria, fevers and dysentery; as an astringent to stop bleeding; and as a tonic[318 ]. They are also used as a digestive, emmenagogue and to treat parasites both within and on the body[318 ]. Research has discovered a range of medically active compounds in the plant. The main active compounds are a group of triterpenes called quassinoids. The antiprotozoal and antimalarial properties of these chemicals have been documented for many years. Several of the quassinoids found in simarouba, such as ailanthinone, glaucarubinone, and holacanthone, are considered the plant's main therapeutic constituents and are the ones documented to be antiprotozoal, anti-amoebic, antimalarial, and even toxic to cancer and leukaemia cells. Studies have shown that the plant is over 90% effective against amoebic dysentery[318 ] The bark, and/or its three main quassinoids, have been shown to be an effective treatment against malaria, including strains that have become resistant to drug treatment[318 ]. Research has also shown that the bark has good antiviral properties, effective against herpes, influenza, polio, and vaccinia viruses[318 ]. The quassinoids responsible for the anti-amoebic and antimalarial properties have also been shown to possess active cancer-killing properties[318 ]. The bark is used as a bitter tonic[46 ]. It is known as 'Jamaica Bark' or 'Orinoco Simaruba Oil'[46 ]. A decoction is taken internally in the treatment of anaemia, diarrhoea, dysentery, malaria, fevers, haemorrhages, intestinal parasites and colitis[318 , 739 ]. The leaves are used in the treatment of rheumatism, or are applied in the form of a lotion for body pain, bruises or skin itch[418 ]. The fruit is a strong stimulant with a pleasantly bitter taste, it is an effective treatment for dysentery[348 ]."

23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree that tolerates full sun; provides food for the native fauna; supplies a range of commodities for humans; and has various soil improving actions - it is an excellent choice as part of a mixed planting when restoring native woodland and also for establishing woodland gardens[419 , K ]. The tree has a well-developed root system and an evergreen, dense canopy - it efficiently checks soil erosion, supports soil microbial life, and improves groundwater availability[418 ]. It is shade tolerant and occurs as an under-storey tree, particularly under the canopy of large fruit trees where birds perch and deposit the seeds. It is found as an associated species of the subtropical moist forest, sharing a position with other common trees of the home and humid perennial gardens, such as mango (Mangifera indica), royal palm (Roystonea borinquena), avocado (Persea americana) and plantain (Musa x paridisiaca)[418 ]. The oilcake being rich in nitrogen (8%), phosphorus (1.1%) and potash (1.2%), is good organic manure[418 ]. The pulp and leaf litter can be economically used in the manufacture of vermicompost (about 8 tons/ha/year)[418 ]. Other Uses An oil obtained from the seed can be used for industrial purposes in the manufacture of bio-fuels, soaps, detergents, lubricants, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc[418 ]. The seed shells can be used in the manufacture of particleboard, activated charcoal or as fuel[418 ]. Freshly cut, the heartwood is whitish or cream coloured with occasionally a yellow or greenish cast - when dry it becomes a uniform cream colour with occasional oily streaks; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. The texture is medium to coarse, and uniform; the grain usually straight; lustre is rather high; there is no odour but there is a bitter quinine-like taste. The wood is very light in weight; very soft; not very strong; somewhat brittle; not durable outdoors and is very susceptible to dry-wood termite attack and prone to blue stain. It seasons rapidly, with little chance of distortion or checking; once dry it is stable in service. It works easily and machines to a smooth clean surface; it is easy to finish, though filling is recommended in order to obtain a good surface; nailing and screwing are poor; gluing is correct. The wood is used as the sounding board for string instruments, for interior construction, turnery, boxes and crates, matches, furniture components, veneer and plywood, pattern making, millwork, particleboard and fibreboard[316 , 378 , 848 ]."

Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: StandardA plant of the moist, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 800 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature ranges between 22 - 29°c, but can tolerate a range of 18 - 34°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,200 - 4,000mm, growing in areas with a distinct dry season and where there is no dry season[418 ]. Shade tolerant[418 ]. Prefers sandy soils in the wild[341 , 378 ]. In the wild, it is found on rocky, shallow calcareous soils of mountain slopes and ridges, as well as on the deeper soils of the ravines and alluvial plains[418 ]. The plant develops a shallow root system, often suitable to mountain soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 8, tolerating 5.5 - 8.5[418 ]. A fast-growing tree[419 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A moderate rate of germination can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 20 - 40 days[419 ]. When the seedbed-sown seedlings are 4 - 6cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 4 - 5 months later[419 ]."
