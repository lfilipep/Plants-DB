13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Aralia cordata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young branched shoots - cooked or raw[2, 46, 61, 105, 177, 279]. They can be up to 1.5 metres long and have a mild and agreeable flavour[116]. They are usually blanched and are crisp and tender with a unique lemon-like flavour[183]. They can be sliced and added to salads, soups etc[206]. The shoots contain about 1.1% protein, 0.42% fat, 0.8% soluble carbohydrate, 0.55% ash[179]. Root - cooked[22, 105, 177]. Used like scorzonera[2].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Carminative  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Stimulant  Stomachic  TonicThe root is sometimes used in China as a substitute for ginseng (Panax species)[218]. It is said to be analgesic, antiinflammatory, carminative, diuretic, febrifuge, stimulant, stomachic and tonic[218, 279]. The root contains an essential oil, saponins, sesquiterpenes and diterpene acids[279]. It is used in Korea to treat the common cold and migraines[279].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good deep loam and a semi-shady position[1, 134]. Requires a sheltered position[1]. Plants are hardier when grown in poorer soils[200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.0 to 7.4. Dormant plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. This is a commonly cultivated food crop in Japan, where it is grown for its edible shoots. There are several named varieties[2, 46, 58, 116]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 4 months at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Once the plants are 25cm or more tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, late spring or early summer being the best time to do this. Root cuttings 8cm long, December in a cold frame[11, 78]. Store the roots upside down in sand and pot up in March/April. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in late winter[11]. Very easy, the suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required.",
