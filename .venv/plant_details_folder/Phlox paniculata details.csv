It germinates in the spring[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have grown enough. Otherwise overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out in the spring. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in spring or mid-summer in a cold frame[111]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Root cuttings, winter in a cold frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
