Succeeds in heavy or light soils so long as they are moist[1]. Grows in full sun or semi-shade, succeeding in the light dappled shade of woodland edges[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. A very ornamental plant[233], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The type species is rarely cultivated[188] but a number of varieties have been selected for their ornamental value[187]. The flowers emit a deliciously sweet perfume, though some people find it unpleasant especially as the flowers start to fade[245]. A good butterfly plant[30].  Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sandy loam in a warm greenhouse. It germinates in the spring[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have grown enough. Otherwise overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out in the spring. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Basal cuttings in spring or mid-summer in a cold frame[111]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Root cuttings, winter in a cold frame.",
