The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

It is hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens[154], though this cannot be applied directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. It is likely that this species will only succeed outdoors in the milder areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a lighter basic soil[17] of low to medium fertility[200]. Bindweed is a very deep-rooting plant with a vigorous root system that extends to a considerable distance and is very hard to eradicate from the soil. Even a small piece of the root will grow into a new plant if it is left in the ground. Once established this plant soon becomes a pernicious weed[1, 4]. It is a climbing plant that supports itself by twining around any support it can find and can soon swamp and strangle other plants[4]. The flowers close at night and also during rainy weather[4]. Some members of this genus harbour tobacco mosaic virus of the Solanaceae[13] and so should not be grown near potatoes, tomatoes and other members of that family.","Seed - best sown in situ as soon as it is ripe, it germinates in the autumn[164]. This species can become a real pest in the garden so it is unwise to encourage it.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
