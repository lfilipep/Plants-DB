An infusion is used in the treatment of a variety of complaints such as rheumatism, epilepsy, asthma, colds and fevers[257]. Applied externally, it is used as a poultice on piles or to draw splinters out of the body, and can also be applied to the bath water[4, 257]. The leaves are rubbed onto insect stings[222].
