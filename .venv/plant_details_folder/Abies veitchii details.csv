13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Abies veitchii is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft 0in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good moist but not water-logged soil[1]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very shade tolerant, especially when young, but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. Not a long-lived tree, but it is relatively fast growing[11, 81]. Trees can put on new growth of 75cm two years after planting out and grow at up to 1 metre a year for the first 20 years or so of their life[185]. Growth rapidly tails off at this age, however, and trees often die quite soon afterwards[185]. Trees are very hardy, but in the milder winters of Britain they are often excited into premature growth and are then susceptible to damage by late frosts[1]. Trees grow best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The flowers are produced in axils of the previous year's shoots[275]. Female flowers are produced relatively early in the life of the tree, usually by the time it is 6 metres tall[185]. This species is sometimes grown as a 'Christmas tree'[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early February in a greenhouse or outdoors in March[78]. Germination is often poor, usually taking about 6 - 8 weeks[78]. Stratification is said to produce a more even germination so it is probably best to sow the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[80, 113]. The seed remains viable for up to 5 years if it is well stored[113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least their first winter in pots. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Alternatively, if you have sufficient seed, it is possible to sow in an outdoor seedbed. One report says that it is best to grow the seedlings on in the shade at a density of about 550 plants per square metre[78] whilst another report says that they are best grown on in a sunny position[80]."
