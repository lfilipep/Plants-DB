The stem, seeds and rhizome contain several steroidal sapogenins, of which diosgenin is the most important one. The rhizome yields 0.5% diosgenin. Diosgenin is a very important raw material used as a precursor in the synthesis of a number of steroidal drugs, including corticosteroids, sex hormones, oral contraceptives and anabolic agents[ 299 ]. The rhizomes also contain the saponins aferosides A and C, as well as dioscin and paryphyllin C and the flavonoid glycoside kaempferol 3-O-a-L-rhamnopyranoside. The last compound showed an ability to potentiate in vitro cisplatin cytotoxicity in a human colon cancer cell line[ 299 ]. A papaverine-like alkaloid is found in the rhizome which causes relaxation of smooth muscle and is an anti-spasmodic, diuretic and central nervous system depressant[ 299 ].
