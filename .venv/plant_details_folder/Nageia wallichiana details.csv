Based on data from 64 collection localities, its climate preferences include a mean annual temperature of 24.7°c, with an average minimum in the coldest month of 19°c, and a mean annual precipitation of 2711mm. It is hardy to Zone 9 (cold hardiness limit between -6.6°c and -1.1°c[329 ]. Plants can succeed in soils with low levels of nutrients[338 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if fruit and seed are required[443 ]."
