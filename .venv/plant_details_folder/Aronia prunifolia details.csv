24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist peaty soil in full sun or partial shade[200]. Succeeds in most soils but dislikes shallow chalk[200]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[200]. This genus is closely related to Sorbus species[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species is probably a naturally occurring hybrid, A. arbutifolia x A. melanocarpa[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in pots outdoors or in a cold frame[113]. Pre-soak stored seed overnight and then cold stratify for 3 months at 2°c[113]. The seed germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring. Since this species is believed to be a hybrid it will probably not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[200]. Very easy, they can be planted straight out into their permanent positions. Layering[200].",
