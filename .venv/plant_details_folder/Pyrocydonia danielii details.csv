Tolerates atmospheric pollution, excessive moisture and a range of soil types if they are moderately fertile[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. A bigeneric hybrid, it will not breed true from seed even if fertile seed is produced. If by chance you do obtain seed, then it is best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of softwood in early summer, treated with rooting hormone and rooted in a closed case with bottom heat[200]. Grafting onto Pyrus communis.",
