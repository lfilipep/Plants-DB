24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Requires a wet lime-free humus-rich soil by the side of water or in shallow still or slowly flowing water in a sunny position[200]. Plants are best grown in clumps[1].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in late summer in pots of soil that are submerged to their rims in water[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in trays of water in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Stem cuttings rooted in wet mud in the summer[200]."
