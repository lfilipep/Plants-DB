It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from August to October.

The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil."

23,Other Uses Description,"- soft, close and even grained, very handsome. Used for turnery, carving etc[146]. The wood of the roots is especially handsome, it is deep red in colour[158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any good soil, tolerating lime but perhaps not suitable for very chalky soils[11]. A useful plant for moist shady positions[11]. Dislikes cold drying winds. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -20°c[184]. Plants have withstood 30° of frost at Kew Gardens, but prefer shelter[11]. Very closely related to D. himalense and possibly no more than a sub-species of that species[11]. The flowers have a pungent aroma[182]. They are produced in racemes on the previous year's wood[11]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of moderately ripened wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel or at a junction with old wood, July in individual pots in a frame. The cuttings are slow to root, give them brisk bottom heat[78]. Fair percentage[78]. Layering of current seasons growth, 12cm long in August/September. Takes 12 - 18 months. High percentage[78]."
