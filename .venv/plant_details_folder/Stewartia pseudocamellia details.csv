24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep humus-rich moist but not boggy soil[200]. Dislikes limey soils, preferring peaty conditions[11, 200]. Prefers a position with some shade, at least from the midday sun[200]. Another report says that it prefers a sunny sheltered position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. Resents root disturbance, plants should be put in their permanent positions as soon as possible[11, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoor seedbed if there is sufficient seed[78]. Stored seed is best soaked for 3 days in warm water and then given 3 - 5 months warm stratification followed by 3 months cold stratification at 5°c, it can take 18 months to germinate[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in early summer. Cuttings of short side branches, 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[1, 200]. One report says it is best to keep the cuttings growing through the winter if possible[1] whilst another says they should be allowed to become dormant once they have rooted[200]. Layering."
