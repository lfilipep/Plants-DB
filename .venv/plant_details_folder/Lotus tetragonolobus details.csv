24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1], preferring a rich light well-drained soil in a sunny position[33]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible young seedpods and also as an ornamental plant[16, 33]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in the spring[33]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 15°c. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer[33].",
