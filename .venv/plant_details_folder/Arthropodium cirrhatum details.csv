Plants are not very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. They can succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain, but they are best grown in a cold greenhouse in this country[200]. A polymorphic species[200]. This plant was possibly formerly cultivated for its edible root by the Maoris, the root grows larger under cultivation[173]."
