It is a deciduous tree with a vase-shaped crown growing up to 18 meters tall and a bole of up to 30-50 cm in diameter. It is mainly used as a fuel though due to its vigorous characteristic, it has high potential in reforestation usage. Its wood is only used for lower quality indoor purposes.","Ateleia glazioveana is a deciduous Tree growing to 13 m (42ft) by 13 m (42ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree, tolerant of the sun even as a seedling, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Considered to be a weed in many pasture areas, this is an excellent species to choose when restoring native woodland[ 419 ]. It could also be used as a pioneer species when starting a woodland garden, though should only be used within its natural range due to the possibility that it could escape from cultivation and invade non-native areas[ K ]. Other Uses The wood is light in weight, smooth, not very compact, slightly coarse surface, of low durability when exposed to the elements. It is only used for lower quality indoor purposes such as sheathing, inner walls, laths, boxes etc[ 419 ]. The wood is used for fuel[ 419 ].",,"Grows best in a sunny position[ 419 ]. Prefers a moist soil[ 419 ]. The plant is a vigorous pioneer species, producing seed abundantly and self-sowing freely into open land. It is considered to be a weed in some parts of its native range where it has invaded pasture land[ 419 ]. A fast-growing tree, easily reaching a height of 4 metres or more within 2 years from seed[ 419 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. A high germination rate can usually be expected, with the seed sprouting within 10 - 20 days[ 419 ]. The seedlings grow away quickly and they should be ready to plant out less than 5 months later[ 419 ]. Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
