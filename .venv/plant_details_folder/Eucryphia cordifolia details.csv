23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained open loamy soil[1, 11]. It is quite tolerant of chalky soils[184] but prefers an acid humus-rich soil[182, 200]. Prefers to have its roots in the shade but its canopy in the sun[166, 200]. This species only really thrives in cool moist maritime climates, tolerating temperatures down to -10°c[184]. It succeeds outdoors in Britain in Sussex and south and west from there[11]. Plants rarely exceed 10 metres in height in cultivation in Britain. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. A good bee plant[46, 61, 139].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February in a greenhouse. The seed should be stored cool and dry over the winter. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a heel, June/July in individual pots in a frame. Roots in 5 - 6 weeks. A variable percentage succeed[78]. Layering in late summer. Takes 16 months. High percentage[78].",
