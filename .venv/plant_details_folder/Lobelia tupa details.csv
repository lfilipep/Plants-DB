22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Best grown in full sun or in an open position in light shade with some shelter from the wind[200]. Requires a permanently moist fertile loamy soil[200]. This species is hardy to about -10°c, but in areas with mild maritime winters plants can be induced into early growth and this growth is more susceptible to frost damage[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in the spring[200]. Plants can also be divided and potted up in the autumn and kept in a cold frame over the winter to protect against losses in severe winters[200]."
