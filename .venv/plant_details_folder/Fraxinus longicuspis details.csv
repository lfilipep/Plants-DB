22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep loamy soil, even if it is on the heavy side[1, 200]. Most members of this genus are gross feeders and require a rich soil[11, 200]. Plants succeed when growing in exposed positions[200] and also in alkaline soils[11]. They tolerate atmospheric pollution[200]. This species is closely related to F. chinensis[11]. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species. The information was gathered under the name F. pubinervis which, according to [11] is a synonym for F. longicuspis Sieb.&Zucc. However, [200] says that F. pubinervis a synonym for F. sieboldiana and that F. longicuspis Hort. is also a synonym of F. sieboldiana. This species might be dioecious, in which case male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best harvested green - as soon as it is fully developed but before it has fully dried on the tree - and can then be sown immediately in a cold frame[80]. It usually germinates in the spring[80]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as possible in a cold frame[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions or a nursery bed in late spring or early summer of the following year. If you have sufficient seed then it is possible to sow it directly into an outdoor seedbed, preferably in the autumn. Grow the seedlings on in the seedbed for 2 years before transplanting either to their permanent positions or to nursery beds.",
