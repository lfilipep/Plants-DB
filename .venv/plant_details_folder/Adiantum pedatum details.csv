0,Adiantum pedatum,"Northern Maidenhair,American Maidenhair Fern",Polypodiaceae,4-9,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].","Rich, deciduous woodlands, often on humus-covered talus slopes and moist lime soils, from sea level to 700 metres[270].","N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. The seeds ripen from August to October.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover;,None known,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Astringent  Demulcent  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Febrifuge  Haemostatic  Pectoral  TonicThe whole plant is considered to be antirheumatic, astringent, demulcent, emmenagogue, expectorant, febrifuge, haemostatic, pectoral and tonic[172, 222, 240]. A tea or syrup is used in the treatment of nasal congestion, asthma, sore throats etc[222]. A decoction of the root was massaged into rheumatic joints[257]. The N. American Indians chewed the fronds and then applied them to wounds to stop bleeding[213]. A strong infusion of the whole plant was has been used as an emetic in the treatment of ague and fevers[257]. This plant was highly valued as a medicinal plant in the 19th century and merits scientific investigation[222].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Lining: Used for lining boxes, baskets etc so that fragile items can be more safely carried in them.","The stipe of the plant is used as an ornament in basketry[172, 157]. The leaves can be used as a lining for carrying or storing fruits in baskets and on racks[257]. The plant is used as a hair conditioner[172]. The stems have been used as a hair wash to make the hair shiny[222]. Plants can be used for ground cover when planted about 30cm apart either way, they form a slowly spreading clump[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Container, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a cool moist shady position[1, 187]. Requires an abundance of moisture in the air and soil[1]. Prefers an alkaline soil[200]. Requires an acid soil according to another report. A very ornamental plant[1], it does not always succeed outdoors in Britain[1]. It probably prefers to be covered in snow overwinter - could a mulch help[1]? This species is often divided into three separate species by botanists - the type species is found in eastern N. America, A. aleuticum is found in western N. America and a third species is found in eastern Asia[270]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Plants have a slowly-increasing rootstock[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, There are no flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Spores - best sown as soon as ripe on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and keep them humid until they are well established. Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position.
