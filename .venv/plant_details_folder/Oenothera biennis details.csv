The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies), bees. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Oil: ",
19,Edible Uses Description,"t - cooked. Boiled and eaten like salsify[4, 12, 27, 33, 66]. Fleshy, sweet and succulent[74]. Wholesome and nutritious[2]. A peppery taste[159]. The taste somewhat resembles salsify or parsnips[183]. Young shoots - raw or cooked[2, 12, 52, 85, 183]. Mucilaginous, with a peppery flavour, they are best used sparingly[159]. Another source suggests that the shoots should not be eaten[9]. Flowers - sweet. Used in salads or as a garnish[183]. Young seedpods - cooked. Steamed[183]. The seed contains 28% of a drying oil[114]. It is edible and a very good source of gamma-linolenic acid[141], an essential fatty acid that is not found in many plant sources and has numerous vital functions in the body. The seed, however, is very small and difficult to harvest, it has to be done by hand[160]. Overall yields are low, making the oil very expensive to produce.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticholesterolemic  Antipruritic  Astringent  Eczema  Hypotensive  Miscellany  SedativeThe bark and the leaves are astringent and sedative[4, 21]. They have proved of use in the treatment of gastro-intestinal disorders of a functional origin, whooping cough and asthma[4]. A syrup made from the flowers is also an effective treatment for whooping cough[7]. The bark is stripped from the flowering stem and dried for later use, the leaves are also harvested and dried at this time[4]. Evening primrose oil has become a well-known food supplement since the 1980's. Research suggests that the oil is potentially very valuable in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, pre-menstrual tension, hyperactivity etc[66]. It is also taken internally in the treatment of eczema, acne, brittle nails, rheumatoid arthritis and alcohol-related liver damage[238]. Regular consumption of the oil helps to reduce blood cholesterol levels and lower the blood pressure[21, 66]. The seed is a good source of gamma-linolenic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid which assists the production of hormone-like substances[222, 238]. This process is commonly blocked in the body, causing disorders that affect the uterine muscles, nervous system and metabolism[238]. The poulticed root is applied to piles and bruises[222]. A tea made from the roots is used in the treatment of obesity and bowel pains[222].",
22,Other Uses,"Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,The oil from the seed is added to skin preparations and cosmetics. It is often combined with vitamin E to prevent oxidation[238]. A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[7]. A finely ground powder made from the flowering stems is used cosmetically in face-masks to counteract reddened skins[7].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a dryish well-drained sandy loam and a warm sunny position[1, 4, 200], though it is tolerant of most soils[4]. Heavy clay soils may induce winter rots[200]. Grows well on very poor soils[160, 238]. Established plants are drought resistant[160]. Formerly cultivated for its edible roots, the evening primrose is being increasingly cultivated for the oil contained in its seed which contains certain essential fatty acids and is a very valuable addition to the diet[66]. See the notes on medicinal uses for more details. The flowers open in the evening and are strongly scented with a delicious sweet perfume[245], attracting pollinating moths[4]. The seeds are a good food source for birds[200]. Plants usually self-sow freely if they are growing in a suitable position, they can naturalize in the wild garden[4, K]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ from late spring to early summer[200].,
