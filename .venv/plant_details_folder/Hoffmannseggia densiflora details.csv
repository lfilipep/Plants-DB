13,Summary,"This name is a synonym of Hoffmannseggia glauca. Hoffmannseggia glauca is a perennial plant growing from a rhizomatous rootstock with long, underground stems which bear small dark blackish-brown, spheroid tubers ('hog potatoes') up to Icm in diameter. The aerial stems are usually unbranched, up to 40cm tall[1493 ]. The plant is harvested from the wild for local use as food. It is said to have good ornamental value[330 ]. This species can spread aggressively, at least in part, using its underground stems and tubers. It has spread to the Mediterranean and is considered an aggressive grassland weed in its native range[1493 ].",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Hoffmannseggia densiflora is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft). The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies), Diptera.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Hoffmannseggia glauca is native to mainly sub-arid climates and is not very cold-hardy, being able to tolerate short-lived temperatures falling to around -8°c when fully dormant[330 ]. It can tolerate occasional snow cover up to 2 weeks a year[330 ]. The plant is likely to require a sunny position and to succeed in alkaline and heavy soils[K ]. Plants are known to tolerate at least some soil salinity. Established plants are very drought-tolerant [1493 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and, therefore, does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[1309 ]. Cultivation: Ornamental, Wild.",
