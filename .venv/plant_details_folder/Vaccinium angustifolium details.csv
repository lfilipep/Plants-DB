See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",V. lamarckii. Camp. V. pennsylvanicun angustifolium. V. pensylvanicum. Lam. non Mill.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,Fruit: ,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw, cooked or used in preserves etc[2, 161, 177, 183]. A very sweet pleasant flavour with a slight taste of honey[11, 43, 183]. Largely grown for the canning industry, it is considered to be the best of the lowbush type blueberries[183]. The fruit can be dried and used like raisins[62]. The fruit is about 12mm in diameter[200]. This is the earliest commercially grown blueberry to ripen[235]. A tea is made from the leaves and dried fruits[101].","Blood tonic: Is this any different to a blood purifier?,Oxytoxic: Hastens parturition and stimulates uterine contractions.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Blood tonic  OxytoxicA tea made from the leaves has been used as a blood purifier and in the treatment of infant's colic[222, 257]. It has also been used to induce labour and as a tonic after a miscarriage[222, 257].",,None known,,"Requires a moist but freely-draining lime free soil, preferring one that is rich in peat or a light loamy soil with added leaf-mould[11, 200]. Prefers a very acid soil with a pH in the range of 4.5 to 6, plants soon become chlorotic when lime is present. Succeeds in full sun or light shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[200]. Requires shelter from strong winds[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -40°c[200]. Dislikes root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots until being planted out in their permanent positions[200]. Cultivated for its edible fruits, there are some named varieties[1, 183]. It succeeds in cold northerly locations such as Maine in N. America[183] and in C. Sweden. However, it is said to have little or no value as a fruit crop in Britain[11]. The typical species is not as well known as its subspecies V. angustifolium laevifolium. House[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].","Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse in a lime-free potting mix and only just cover the seed[78]. Stored seed might require a period of up to 3 months cold stratification[113]. Another report says that it is best to sow the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe[200]. Once they are about 5cm tall, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame[78]. Slow and difficult. Layering in late summer or early autumn[78]. Another report says that spring is the best time to layer[200]. Takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in spring or early autumn[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
