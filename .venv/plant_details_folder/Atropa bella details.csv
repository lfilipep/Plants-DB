0,Atropa bella,"Deadly Nightshade, Belladonna",Solanaceae,6-9,"The whole plant, and especially the root, is very poisonous[4, 7, 10, 19, 65, 165]. Even handling the plant has been known to cause problems if the person has cuts or grazes on the hand[4]. The plant is particularly dangerous for children since the fruit looks attractive and has a sweet taste[4]. The toxins are concentrated in the ripe fruit[200].","Woods, thickets and hedges, mainly on calcareous soils[9].","Central and southern Europe, including Britain, south ad east to N. Africa and Iran.",(0 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AtropaBella-donna.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AtropaBella-donna2.jpg",,"Atropa bella-donna is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.9 m (3ft) by 0.8 m (2ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Atropa belladonna,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedgerow;,,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Hallucinogenic: Causes the mind to hallucinate.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Mydriatic: Dilates the pupils of the eyes.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antidote  Antispasmodic  Diuretic  Hallucinogenic  Homeopathy  Mydriatic  Narcotic  Sedative  UrinaryAlthough it is poisonous, deadly nightshade has a long history of medicinal use and has a wide range of applications, in particular it is used to dilate the pupils in eye operations, to relieve intestinal colic and to treat peptic ulcers[254]. The plant can be used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, reducing tremors and rigidity whilst improving speech and mobility[254]. It has also been used as an antidote in cases of mushroom or toadstool poisoning[7]. This is a very poisonous plant, it should be used with extreme caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. All parts of the plant are analgesic, antidote, antispasmodic, diuretic, hallucinogenic, mydriatic, narcotic and sedative[4, 7, 9, 21, 46, 165, 171, 192, 240]. The root is the most active part of the plant, it is harvested in the autumn and can be 1 - 3 years old, though the older roots are very large and difficult to dig up[4, 7]. The leaves are harvested in late spring and dried for later use[7]. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids[254]. The leaves contain on average 0.4% active alkaloids, whilst the root contains around 0.6%[240]. The alkaloid content also varies according to the development of the plant, being low when the plant is flowering and very high when bearing green berries[240]. These alkaloids inhibit the parasympathetic nervous system which controls involuntary body activities. This reduces saliva, gastric, intestinal and bronchial secretions, as well as the activity of the urinary tubules, bladder and intestines[254]. An extract of the plant has been used as eyedrops. It has the effect of dilating the pupils thus making it easier to perform eye operations[4, 232]. In the past women used to put the drops in their eyes in order to make them look larger and thus 'more beautiful'[4, 232]. The entire plant, harvested when coming into flower, is used to make a homeopathic remedy[232]. This is used especially in cases where there is localised and painful inflammation that radiates heat[232]. It is also used to treat sunstroke and painful menstruation[238].",Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,This species has been found to be effective in removing PCB's from the soil and detoxifying them[248]. The plant is more effective in doing this if it is infected with the bacterial parasite Agrobacterium tumefaciens[248].,,"Succeeds in any well-drained moisture retentive soil[200] in sun or partial shade[238]. Prefers a calcareous soil[1, 4, 9, 13]. When grown as a medicinal plant, the highest levels of the medically active alkaloids are obtained from plants growing on a light, permeable chalky soil, especially when on a south-west facing slope[4]. The highest concentrations are also formed when the plant is growing in a sunny position and in hot summers[238]. The northerly limits of cultivation are about 50 - 55° north and at an altitude between 100 - 200 metres[4]. This species is widely cultivated, especially in eastern Europe, for the medically active compounds it contains. These are used in the drugs industry to produce a range of medicines[238]. Plants tend to be short-lived[200]. Slugs are very fond of this plant and have been known to completely remove the outer bark from the stems[K].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Germination of stored seed is slow and erratic, usually taking 1 - 6 months at 10°c[134, 200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of softwood terminal shoots in spring[200]. Root cuttings in winter[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
