13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Lesquerella hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.8 m (2ft 7in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."
15,Synonyms,"Recent work has shown that Lesquerella is indistinct from the genus Physaria and both genera have been united under Physaria. In addition, the former Lesquerella of the southeastern United States have been moved to the genus Paysonia since 2002."
16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Uses Description,Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: oil (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1].

20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"The seed of some species yields up to 28% oil and 22% protein[269]. Average yields of 1.1 tonnes per hectare have been postulated and in small-scale experiments 1.6 tonnes has been attained[269]. The oil has possibilities in the manufacture of grease thickeners due to the hydroxy-acid content. Major amounts of hydroxy-acids occur in the obscure seed oils, among them Lesquerella, but few of them have been subjected to development. According to Osman and Ahmad (1981), the only hydroxylated vegetable oil commercially available is castor oil. Other potential sources include Castalis, Coriaria, Dimorphotheca, Hiptage, and Osteospermum[269]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Perennial Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  New Perennial Crop  Staple Crop: Oil  Under DevelopmentClimate: warm temperate to subtropical. Humidity: semi-arid. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: new crop as annual, perennials under development. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
