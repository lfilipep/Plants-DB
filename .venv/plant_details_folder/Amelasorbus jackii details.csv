See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,Fruit - raw or cooked.

This species probably tolerates some lime in the soil[200].Succeeds in semi-shade though it fruits less well in such a position[200]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. Plants are surprisingly vigorous in British gardens[11]. A naturally occurring bi-generic hybrid, Amelanchier alnifolia semiintegrifolia x Sorbus scopulina, it is very variable in the wild[182, 200].","Seed - it is best harvested 'green', when the seed is fully formed but before the seed coat has hardened, and then sown immediately in pots outdoors or in a cold frame. If stored seed is obtained early enough in the autumn, it can be given 4 weeks warm stratification before being left out in the winter and it should then germinate in the spring. Otherwise seed can be very slow to germinate, perhaps taking 18 months or more. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a sheltered outdoor position, planting them out once they are 20cm or more tall. This is a bi-generic hybrid and, if seed is produced, it is unlikely to breed true. If there is sufficient seed it is best to sow it thinly in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Grow the seedlings on for two years in the seedbed before planting them out into their permanent positions during the winter. Layering in spring - takes 18 months[78]. Division of suckers in late winter. The suckers need to have been growing for 2 years before you dig them up, otherwise they will not have formed roots. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
