24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will succeed in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. A calcicole species, it dislikes acid soils. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. A semi-parasitic plant, growing on grass roots. Rather difficult to establish in cultivation, it is best grown in conditions that approximate to its native habitat[200]. It requires a moist peaty soil and the presence of host grasses[1]. Requires a partially shaded to sunny site in a well-drained gritty but moist soil[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in pots of turf collected from the proximity of wild colonies or sow directly onto the sites where the plants are to remain[200]. Division of established plants might be possible in the spring. Establish the divisions near the parent plants[200]
