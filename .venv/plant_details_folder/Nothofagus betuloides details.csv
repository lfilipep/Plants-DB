It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.

20,Other Uses,"Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The bark is used for making buckets and torches, it is also used as a torch which suggests that it is rich in resin[69].  - heavy, hard. It has similar uses to Fagus sylvatica, the native Beech[46, 61].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers an open well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds on most soils but dislikes calcareous soils[200]. Prefers a pH between 5 and 7, but dislikes acid peats[200]. This species is fairly hardy in southern Britain[1] but it only makes a shrub in exposed positions[200]. A 30 year old tree (1992) has made remarkable growth at Crarae in western Scotland[191]. Trees have poor wind resistance in Britain, probably because they grow so fast[11]. Dislikes cold winds but is tolerant of warm moist winds[166]. Trees up to 4 metres tall can be successfully established, though the optimum size for transplanting is about 30 - 80cm. The roots are very sensitive to desiccation and extreme care should be taken when transplanting them[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cool greenhouse or cold frame. Spring-sown seed requires 2 - 3 months stratification at 1 - 5°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed must not be allowed to dry out according to one report[80] whilst another says that the seed can be stored dry at 2°c for long periods[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Layering.",
