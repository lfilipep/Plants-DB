If this species is like most other members of the family Boraginaceae, the seed is likely to ripen over a period of time and individual seeds fall from the plant when they are ripe. This will make harvesting any quantity of seed very fiddly and time consuming[K]. Leaves - raw[257]. Sometimes the leaves are bruised by rubbing them between the hands and are then eaten with salt[257]."
