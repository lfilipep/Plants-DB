23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be used as a ground cover in light shade, forming a spreading clump[208, 233]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most good garden soils[1], preferring one that is well-drained and moisture retentive[200]. Prefers a sunny position[200]. Succeeds in dry soils in the shade[200]. Grows well in light woodland shade[88], succeeding amongst the roots of other plants[233]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. The plant has an invasive root system and can spread freely when well sited[233]. Slugs are fond of this plant and have destroyed even quite large clumps by eating out all the new growth in spring[K]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A very variable plant with many different forms[187], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
