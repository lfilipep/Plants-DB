The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",M. foetida.

It is used in limited amounts for fuel, baskets, crates, woodenware and furniture[82, 227].",,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Screen, Seashore, Specimen, Street tree. Best grown in a warm position in a moderately rich free soil of an open texture[1]. Tolerates moderately limey soils[200, 202] so long as they are deep and rich in humus[188]. The branches are brittle so a sheltered position is required[200]. Another part of the same book says that this species is fairly wind-resistant[200]. Succeeds in full sun or semi-shade[219]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[200]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. A very ornamental plant[1], a number of named forms have been developed[200]. The flowers are very large (up to 25cm across) and have a delicious and very powerful scent[202, 245]. This is perhaps the most strongly scented flower in the world[245]. They can be produced in trees as young as 10 years old[229]. The form 'Exmouth Variety' (also known as elliptica) produces its flowers when younger than the species, these flowers have a refreshing lemon scent[245]. There is no main flush of flowering, instead the flowers open intermittently throughout the summer[K]. Plants do not normally need pruning, any cutting out of dead wood etc is best carried out in July[219].

Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
