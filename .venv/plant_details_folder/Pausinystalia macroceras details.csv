19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Aphrodisiac  Cardiac  Hallucinogenic  Hypotensive  Parasiticide  Stimulant  VasodilatorThe bark is very widely used as an aphrodisiac and anti-hypnotic[332 ]. The bark sap is applied topically to treat cutaneous and subcutaneous parasitic infections[332 ]. This species is closely related to Pausinystalia johimbe, and is said to have the same medicinal properties and uses[303 ]. These are:- The bark contains up to 6% of a mixture of indole alkaloids, the principle one being yohimbine (which is also known as aphrodine), plus pigments and tannins[254 , 418 ]. The alkaloids have a cerebral stimulant action at low doses, but are highly toxic in large doses[254 ]. Yohimbine has been shown to block the release of adrenalin and, in the correct dose, act as a sexual stimulant[238 ]. It is the source of the only clinically-proven cure for impotence and has long been used as a traditional stimulant in Africa[418 ]. Yohimbe is a bitter, warming, anti-diuretic, hypotensive and vasodilating herb with reputedly aphrodisiac effects[238 ]. It has a stimulant effect upon the heart, increasing heart rate and blood pressure; has a locally anaesthetic action similar to that of cocaine but without being mydriatic; is a mild stimulant that can help to prevent drowsiness; and is hallucinogenic. The vasodilating action of yohimbe is particularly strong on the sex organs, hence its aphrodisiac action[238 , 303 ]. The bark is taken internally, either as a powder or as a decoction. It is used particularly in the treatment of impotence, frigidity and angina[238 , 418 ]. It is also used as a performance enhancer for athletes, and as a remedy to increase the clarity of the voices of singers during long festivals[303 , 418 ]. The bark can be harvested at any time of the year[254 ]. The use of this herb is subject to legal restrictions in some countries[238 , 254 ]."
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses This species is closely related to Pausinystalia johimbe, and is said to have the same uses[303 ]. These are:- The bark is a source of tannins[418 ]. The inner bark is utilized as straps for panniers[303 ]. The tree produces very little sap-wood, the major fraction being an ocreous-yellow heart-wood[332 ]. The wood is flexible so iswidely used as a snare-trap mechanism, whilst the young poles are used for construction purposes in traditional buildings[303 ]. The wood is used as fuel[303 , 418 ]."
