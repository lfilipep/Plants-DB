0,Salix triandra,"Almond-Leaved Willow, Almond willow",Salicaceae,4-8,None known,"Sides of rivers and ponds, marshes etc. Common in England, less so in Wales and very local in Scotland[17].","Europe, including Britain, from Norway south and east to Spain, Japan and Iran in temperate Asia",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixTriandra.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixTriandra2.jpg",,"Salix triandra is a deciduous Tree growing to 9 m (29ft 6in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",S. amygdalina.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,"- raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - cooked. Not very palatable[172, 177]. One report says that the stems have a sweet flavour[182].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  FebrifugeThe fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.","The stems are very flexible and are used in basket making. They are highly valued[1, 11, 23, 131]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark and young leaves[74]. Succeeds in wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Does best in wet seasons[131]. A good bee plant, providing a source of pollen and nectar early in the year[11]. The flowers are especially fragrant for a willow[182]. Plants are best put into their permanent positions as soon as possible[11]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. It is best not to grow this species within 10 metres of a building. Often cultivated for its stems, which are used in basket making[17, 61], there are many named varieties[131]. The stems should be cut down almost to ground level each winter in order to produce long flexible canes[11]. The smooth flaking bark has a smell of almonds[245]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
