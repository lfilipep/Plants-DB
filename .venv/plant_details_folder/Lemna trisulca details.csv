22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position in still water that is rich in nitrates and lime[200]. Duckweed can be a troublesome pond weed though it is easily controlled by simply scooping it out[56, 200]. This scooped out material makes an excellent addition to the compost heap. The growing plant is a good food source for fish and birds, as well as providing cover for creatures in the pond[200]. This species is very suitable for use in cold water aquaria though, like all members of the genus, it can harbour fish parasites[200]. The plant over-winters in temperate areas by means of resting buds which sink to the bottom of the pond in the late autumn and rise again in the spring[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but, since it spreads so rapidly by division, it really needs no extra help once it is in a pond."
