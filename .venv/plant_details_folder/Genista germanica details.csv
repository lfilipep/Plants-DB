Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown autumn in a cold frame. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow February in a cold frame. Good germination[78].
