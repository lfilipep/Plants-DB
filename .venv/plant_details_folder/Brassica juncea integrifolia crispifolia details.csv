It is grown from seeds and is used as a green manure. It prefers temperate areas as it is not resistant to drought. The leaves are eaten raw and added into salads or cooked as vegetables. Sweet and succulent flowers and young flowering stems are also eaten raw or cooked. The seed, on the other hand, contains edible semi-drying oil. It is also the source of “brown mustard” and is used whole in curries and pickles. Curled mustard is also used as medicine. In particular, it is use against arthritis, foot ache, lumbago and rheumatism. The seed is used as treatment for tumours, abscesses, colds, lumbago, rheumatism, and stomach disorders. The root is used to increase milk supply in lactating women. The oil is used as treatment for skin disorders and ulcers. Lastly, the leaves are used to relieve headache, inflammation, bladder, and haemorrhage.","Brassica juncea integrifolia crispifolia is a ANNUAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",No synonyms are recorded for this name.,,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","Leaves - raw or cooked[ 22 , 33 , 46 , 52 , 61 ]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[ 206 ]. The leaves can also be finely shredded and added to mixed salads[ 206 ]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[ 183 ]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[ 52 ]. Sweet and succulent[ 133 ]. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[ 1 , 2 , 17 , 57 , 183 ]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[ 74 ]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[ 171 ]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[ 183 ], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[ 238 ]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[ 238 ]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[ 238 ]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[ 238 ]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads.","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiarthritic: Treats arthritis.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer.

Agroforestry Uses: There is some evidence that if this plant is grown as a green manure it is effective in reducing soil-borne root rots in pea crops[ 206 ].

There are some named varieties[ 206 ]. Very hardy in cold weather, it is used more in temperate areas than in tropical ones. Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[ 16 , 200 , 206 ]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[ 16 ]. Dislikes very hot weather[ 33 ]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[ 206 ]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[ 269 ]. A good bee plant[ 74 ].","Seed - sow in situ from August to October. Spring and early summer-sown crops tend to run quickly to seed, though they can be eaten whilst still small[ 206 ]. It is best not to sow the seed in very hot weather[ 206 ].
