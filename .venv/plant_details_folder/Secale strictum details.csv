The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",S. cereale montanum.,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - used as a whole grain or ground into a flour and used for making bread etc[46, 177, 183]. Somewhat smaller than the seed of S. cereale but produced abundantly. It is relatively difficult to extract the seed from the glumes by hand[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Succeeds in most soils but prefers a well-drained light soil in a sunny position[1]. One report says that it requires protection from severe frosts[1], though our experience is that it is hardy in most parts of the country[K]. Mountain rye is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed[61], it is possibly a parent of the cultivated Rye, S. cereale[57]. This species has an excellent potential as a perennial cereal crop in temperate zones. Although the seed is somewhat smaller than the cultivated annual rye, it is produced abundantly, especially from the second year onwards. The plant tillers well, especially in its second and subsequent years, and the ears in selected varieties can be 25cm long[K]. Not all forms of this species are perennial, the subspecies S. strictum kuprijanovii. Gross. is reliably so[46].","Seed - sow March or October in situ and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If the seed is in short supply, it can be grown in pots in the greenhouse or cold frame in early spring. Only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
