1,Common Name,"Spanish Bayonet, Aloe yucca, Dagger Plant, Yucca, Spanish Bayonet",
2,Family,Agavaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,8-10,
4,Known Hazards,"The roots contain saponins[222]. Whilst saponins are quite toxic to people, they are poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass straight through. They are also destroyed by prolonged heat, such as slow baking in an oven. Saponins are found in many common foods such as beans[K]. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",
5,Habitats,"Sand dunes of the coast, occasionally up to 60 km inland, in pine forests[82]. Also found on the margins of brackish marshes[229].",

It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making ropes, baskets and mats[169]. Narrow, split leaf strips have been used as sewing material for coiled plaques[257]. The leaves have been used in several types of basketry[257]. The leaf splints have been used as brushes to apply colour to pottery[257]. The leaves can be split and used as a temporary string[257]. The roots are rich in saponins and can be used as a soap substitute. They are crushed and then placed in water to form suds that are used in bathing and shampooing[257]. The juice from the plant has been used as a varnish[257].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Seashore, Specimen. Thrives in any soil but prefers a sandy loam and full exposure to the south[11]. They can succeed in light shade[K]. Plants are hardier when grown on poor sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is only hardy in the mildest areas of Britain tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c if in a suitable site[11, 200]. It requires greenhouse protection in most of the country[1]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The flowers of most members of this genus can only be pollinated by a certain species of moth. This moth cannot live in Britain and, if fruit and seed is required, hand pollination is necessary. This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. This species, however, does not require the Yucca moth for pollination and will set fruit without hand pollination[11]. The flowers open at night[229] and are powerfully fragrant at this time[245]. Individual crowns are monocarpic, dying after flowering[233]. However, the crown will usually produce a number of sideshoots before it dies and these will grow on to flower in later years[233]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. It usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some winter protection for at least their first winter outdoors - a simple pane of glass is usually sufficient[K]. Root cuttings in late winter or early spring. Lift in April/May and remove small buds from base of stem and rhizomes. Dip in dry wood ashes to stop any bleeding and plant in a sandy soil in pots in a greenhouse until established[78].,
