Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Insecticide: Kills insects.,"Other Uses The root is an important source of rotenone, widely used as an organic insecticide[46 , 317 ]. The rotenone content of the roots (ranging from 4 - 11%) is less than that of the related Lonchocarpus nicou (which ranges from 5 - 15%, with some clones yielding 20%). This, however, is somewhat balanced by the fact that the overall yield of roots is higher for this species[317 ].",,"A plant of the moist tropics where it is found at elevations from near sea level to 1,340 metres[418 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature ranges from 23 - 32°c, but can tolerate 15 - 41°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,300 - 2,700mm, but tolerates 2,000 - 3,100mm, and is found in areas with all year round rainfall and also where there is a distinct dry season[418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in dappled shade[418 ]. Young plants benefit from some shade, while older plants make more vigorous growth in full light[418 ]. Grows best in a medium soil that is rich in organic matter, but also succeeds in heavier soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, but can tolerate 5 - 7[418 ]. The first harvest of the stems can be made when the plants are 2 - 3 years old from cuttings[317 ]. The roots are usually harvested during the dry season[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].",Seed -,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
