24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant[90], it succeeds in any position[42] in ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a sunny position[200]. Succeeds in short grass[90], though this should not be mown from the time the bulbs start to grow until they have set seed and the leaves are dying down. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Sow the seed thinly and leave the seedlings undisturbed in the pots for their first dormancy, but apply liquid feed at intervals, especially in their second year of growth. Divide the bulbs at the end of their second year of growth, putting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for one more year and them plant them out into their permanent positions whilst they are dormant. The seed can also be sown in a cold frame in early spring. Division of offsets in September/October[200]. The larger bulbs can be replanted immediately into their permanent positions. It is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year before planting them out when dormant in late summer."
