It grows usually about 30-90 cm in height. The root system is a taproot that can reach a depth of 40-50 cm. The leaves are trifoliate, pinnate, and arranged alternately along the stem on a long petiole. The flowers are bright yellow papilionaceous arranged in a cluster of 6-10. The fruits are smooth, cylindrical, and thin-walled pods. Adzuki bean is commonly sweetened before eating. It is eaten sprouted or boiled. It is also used in many Chinese dishes and as a filling in Japanese sweets. Tender young pods are cooked as a vegetable. Roasted seeds are used as a substitute for coffee. Medicinally, the beans are used in the treatment of kidney diseases, constipation, abscesses, certain tumors, threatened miscarriage, retained placenta, and non-secretion of milk. Seed sprouts are used to treat threatened abortion caused by injury. A flour made from the beans is used in making shampoos and facial creams. V. angularis is also grown as a green manure and for soil erosion control.","Vigna angularis is a ANNUAL growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Azukia angularis (Willd.) Ohwi. Dolichos angularis Willd. Phaseolus angularis (Willd.) W.Wight Phase,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"Mature seed - cooked. The dried bean is boiled and used in a wide variety of dishes. The beans can also be popped in much the same way as popcorn[301 ]. The dried seeds can be ground into a meal and used in soups, cakes or confections[310 ]. The seeds are often sprouted and then eaten either raw or cooked[200 ]. The cylindrical pods can be 6 - 12cm long, containing 6 - 14 seeds[418 ]. Tender young pods are cooked as a vegetable[301 ]. The seedpods are up to 10cm long[200 ]. The roasted seed has been used as a coffee substitute[301 , 310 ].","Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer.

Other Uses A flour made from the beans is used in making shampoos and facial creams[310 ].",,"Adzuki bean is a plant of the subtropics, and is widely cultivated from the temperate zone to higher elevations in the tropics, where it is can be grown at elevations from 420 - 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 30°c, but can tolerate 5 - 36°c[418 ]. The plant cannot tolerate frost. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 900 - 1,300mm, but tolerates 530 - 1,800mm[418 ]. It is generally seen as a short-day plant, requiring a day length of 12 hours or less to initiate flowering and fruiting, though cultivars can vary in their response to day length[200 ]. Requires a sunny position[418 ]. Succeeds in a wide range of well-drained soils[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. Some cultivars are fairly drought tolerant[200 ]. The plant can commence cropping within 60 - 190 days from seed[418 ]. Average seed yields range from 1 - 2.5 tonnes per hectare. In Taiwan yields of 1,450 kilos are common, in Japan 1,900 kilos, in Kenya 500 - 600 kilos and in New Zealand 1,340 - 2,240 kilos[418 ]. There are many named varieties[301 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen. Bloom Color: Bright Yellow. Spacing: 3-6 in. (7-15 cm).",Seed - pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in situ. It requires soil temperatures above 16 ?c for germination[310 ].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
