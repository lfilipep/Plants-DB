0,Pittosporum tobira,"Tobira, Japanese cheesewood, Australian Laurel, Mock Orange, Japanese Pittosporum",Pittosporaceae,8-11,"This plant contains saponins[152, 154]. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans, and although they are fairly toxic to people they are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down if the food is thoroughly cooked for a long time. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].","Rocky hillsides by the coast[184].

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

It can be used in shelterbelt plantings[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Hedge, Massing, Screen, Standard, Seashore, Specimen. Succeeds in most well-drained soils of reasonably good quality in full sun or light shade[200]. Succeeds in dry soils[200]. Very resistant to maritime exposure[184]. Established plants are drought resistant[182]. Hardy to about -10°c[184], succeeding outdoors on the coast of S. England and in London[184]. Plants can be up to 10m tall in their native habitat but rarely exceed 2m in Britain. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[200]. The flowers are very fragrant, with a scent reminiscent of orange blossom[219] and can pervade the air for a considerable distance[245]. Very amenable to pruning, plants can be cut right back into old wood if required[200]. The species in this genus are very likely to hybridize with other members of the genus[200]. When growing a species from seed it is important to ensure that the seed either comes from a known wild source, or from isolated specimens in cultivation. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow when ripe in the autumn or in late winter in a warm greenhouse[78, 200]. The seed usually germinates freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, move the plants to a cold frame as soon as they are established and plant out late in the following spring[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold during their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Poor to fair percentage[78]. Basal ripewood cuttings late autumn in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
