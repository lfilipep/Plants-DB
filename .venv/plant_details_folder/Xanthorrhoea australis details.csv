Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",Nectar: produced in such abundance by some flowers that it can be harvested fairly easily.,"th of the stem is eaten raw or roasted, it has an agreeable nutty taste that is slightly balsamic[193]. It contains about 41% carbohydrate, 3.5% protein and traces of vitamin C[193]. It is possible to extract sugar from the stem[193]. Leaf bases - chewed[144]. They are hard to detach from the plant[144]. They sometimes taste sweet and juicy though more often they are tough and astringent[193]. The flowers produce an abundance of nectar and this can be collected from the flowers, either by sucking the flowers or by cooking them up to produce a syrup[144]. The root might be edible[144].",Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.MiscellanyThe resin has medicinal uses[171]. No details are given.,"Adhesive: Glues.,Friction sticks: Used for starting fires when there are no matches.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Size: Used on materials, paper etc to give a surface that will take ink, dyes etc.,Varnish: Plants that can be used as a varnish without any special treatment. Does not include varnishes made from oils etc.","A resin collects around the bases of old leaves and can be collected by beating the stems[171]. It can be used as a varnish for wood or metal[154, 156, 171] and as an incense[156]. It can also be used as a size, a sealing wax, mahogany stain for wood and medicinally[171]. It makes a good glue[193]. The gum is soft and pliable when heated over a flame but it cools to a rock-hard consistency[193]. The flower stems are good firesticks[193].",,"Requires a well-drained light or medium soil and a very sunny position[200]. Succeeds in poor soils in the wild[154]. This species is not very frost-hardy in this country and normally requires greenhouse protection[1]. It tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[K], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. It would certainly be worthwhile trying it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[K]. Other members of this genus should also have the same edible and non-edible uses[144, 193].","Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in about 5 weeks[157]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer, giving them the protection of a frame or cloche until they are growing away happily. Protect the outdoor plants for at least their first winter.
