24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained light or medium soil and a very sunny position[200]. Succeeds in poor soils in the wild[154]. This species is not very frost-hardy in this country and normally requires greenhouse protection[1]. It tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[K], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. It would certainly be worthwhile trying it outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[K]. Other members of this genus should also have the same edible and non-edible uses[144, 193]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in about 5 weeks[157]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer, giving them the protection of a frame or cloche until they are growing away happily. Protect the outdoor plants for at least their first winter. Division of offsets in late spring."
