24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sunny position succeeding in hot dry soils and tolerating drought once established[190]. Requires a warm open position in full sun, in a sharply drained sandy or gritty soil. If the soil is too rich the plants leaves will not be so silvery[200]. Plants can be grown in a wall[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200].",
