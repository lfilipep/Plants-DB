24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soils[200], but prefers a good loamy soil, abundant moisture and full sunlight[11, 200]. Hardy to about -20°c[184]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[11]. Flowers are produced on the previous seasons growth and any pruning is best done immediately after flowering in order to promote new growth and plenty of flowers in the following year[182]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if possible. It is likely to require stratification before it germinates, so stored seed should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as you receive it. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a light sandy soil a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15cm long, October/November in an outdoor frame[200]. Another report says that September is a good time to do this[11]. Division of suckers in early spring[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
