19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiecchymotic  Antiphlogistic  Epilepsy  Nervine  Sternutatory  VulneraryThe whole flowering plant is antiecchymotic, antiphlogistic, nervine, sternutatory and vulnerary[172]. This species is closely related to A. montana and is included in that species by some botanists. The medicinal uses of that plant are as follows:- Arnica has a long history of herbal use, especially as an external treatment for bruises and sprains[232, 238] - it is an ingredient of a number of proprietary preparations[238]. Internally, it has been used in the treatment of heart complaints and as a booster for the immune system[238]. Arnica increases local blood supply and accelerates healing, it is anti-inflammatory and increases the rate of absorption of internal bleeding[254]. Generally the plant is nowadays only recommended for internal use as a homeopathic medicine, principally for treating shock, injury and pain[254]. If used as a decoction or tincture it stimulates the circulation and is valuable in the treatment of angina and a weak or failing heart, but it can be toxic even at quite low doses and so is rarely used this way[254]. The flowers are the part most commonly used[4, 232], they are harvested when fully open and dried - the receptacles are sometimes removed since these are liable to be attacked by insects[4]. The root is also used, it is harvested after the leaves have died down in the autumn and dried for later use[4]. The whole plant is antiecchymotic, antiphlogistic, nervine, sternutatory, vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 46, 165]. Although a very valuable remedy, it should be used with caution. It has been known to cause contact dermatitis when used externally and collapse when taken internally[238]. Only take it internally under the supervision of a qualified practitioner. The freshly crushed flowers cause sneezing if inhaled[232]. The leaves have also been smoked as a tobacco[232], though it is unclear whether this was for medicinal reasons The whole plant, harvested when in flower, is used in homeopathic remedies[232]. It is especially useful in the treatment of traumatic injuries, sores and bruises[232]. The homeopathic dose has also been used effectively in the treatment of epilepsy and seasickness, and it might be of use as a hair growth stimulant[268].",
