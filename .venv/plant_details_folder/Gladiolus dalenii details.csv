Requires a stony gritty loam. This species is not very cold-hardy, tolerating temperatures down to about 0°c[260]. In Britain it may be possible to plant the corms out in spring, harvest them in the autumn and store them overwinter in a cool frost-free place. This species is one of the parents of the cultivated garden gladiolas[200].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse at 15°c[200]. It usually germinates freely[1]. The seed can also be sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a warm greenhouse[200]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be grown on in the pot without disturbance for their first year, giving them an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs when they are dormant in the autumn, placing about 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another year or two in the greenhouse and then plant them out in late spring. Division. Dig up the corms in October, dry them in well ventilated conditions at about 20°c and then store them in a cool but frost-free place over the winter, planting them out about 10cm deep in April[1, 200]. Cormlets harvested when digging up the corms in the autumn can be stored in a similar manner to the corms[200]. Larger cormlets can be planted out in spring, smaller ones may be best grown on for a year in the greenhouse.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
