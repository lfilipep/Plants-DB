4,Known Hazards,"Great care should be exercised if eating this fruit. It must only be eaten when fully ripe since both before and after that stage it is considered to be poisonous[200 ]. A toxic peptide, hypoglycine A, is contained in the unripe aril[307 ]. The pink raphe that attaches the aril to its seed is deadly toxic and must be carefully and completely removed[307 ]. The pounded fruit is used as fish poison[299 ].",

19,Edible Uses Description,"it - eaten raw when fully ripe[301 ]. The fleshy arils surrounding the seeds are firm and oily, with a nutty flavour, though they can soon become rancid[46 ]. The fleshy fruit can also be curried, used in soups, stews, etc[301 ]. The fruit is harvested when they have split open naturally, revealing four large glossy black seeds embedded in spongy, cream-coloured buttery arils[307 ]. The pear-shaped fruit is about 75mm long, 45mm wide, and is produced in clumps of 3 - 10[46 , 335 ]. The fruit must be allowed to open fully, or at least partly, before it is detached from the tree[317 ]. Unripe or overripe arils, as well as the seeds, contain hypoglycin and its derivative - they are strongly toxic[301 , 317 ]. The seeds yield a yellowish oil that is believed to be edible[299 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Epilepsy: Used in the treatment of Epilepsy - a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antipruritic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Epilepsy  Febrifuge  Laxative  Ophthalmic  Parasiticide  Skin  StomachicThe plant (part not specified) is used to treat anaemia and itching[617 ]. In traditional medicine in Cote d?Ivoire, Blighia sapida is widely used for the treatment of yellow fever, epilepsy and oedema, and as a laxative and diuretic[299 ]. Sap from terminal buds is instilled in the eyes to treat ophthalmia and conjunctivitis[299 ]. The pulp of ground-up leafy twigs is rubbed on the forehead to treat migraine[299 ]. The ground-up leaves, combined with plant salts, are applied as a paste to treat yaws and ulcers[299 ]. The leaves are used in the treatment of fever and vertigo, and twigs to treat hepatitis, cirrhosis and amygdalitis[299 ]. Bark and leaf decoctions are administered to treat oedema, intercostal pain, dysentery and diarrhoea[299 ]. Decoctions of bark or fruit walls are applied to wounds[299 ]. Pounded bark is administered as an antidote to snake and scorpion bites[299 ]. The bark, ground-up with capsicum pepper (Capsicum annuum), is rubbed on the body as a stimulant[299 ]. The seeds are taken to treat stomach complaints, including nausea and vomiting[299 ]. Aqueous seed extracts are administered to expel parasites[299 ]. The fruit pulp is used to treat whitlow[299 ]. A water-soluble and heat-stable toxic compound, hypoglycin A, is present in the aril of unripe seeds, as well as in the seed and in the pinkish to reddish tissue at the base of the aril. The Jamaican vomiting sickness is associated with this compound and is characterized by vomiting, generalized weakness, altered consciousness and sometimes even death. Hypoglycaemia and depression of the central nervous system are common. The aril of fully ripe seeds after natural dehiscence of the fruit is nearly free of the toxic compound. The consumption of unripe seed arils has probably caused many cases of encephalopathy in children in Burkina Faso and other West African countries.",
