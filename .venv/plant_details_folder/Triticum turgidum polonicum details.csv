18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[50, 105, 171]. It is usually ground into a flour and used as a cereal. High in gluten[61]. The large seeds are suitable for making macaroni but not for bread[46, 57, 61, 183]. The grain falls readily from the ears, it is of no value for milling[57]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Starch: Used as a fabric stiffener.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs."
23,Other Uses Description,"The straw has many uses, as a biomass for fuel etc, for thatching, as a mulch in the garden etc[141]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in late summer after the seed has been harvested, they are cut into usable pieces and soaked in clear water for 24 hours. They are then cooked for 2 hours in lye or soda ash and then beaten in a ball mill for 1½ hours in a ball mill. The fibres make a green-tan paper[189]. The starch from the seed is used for laundering, sizing textiles etc[46, 61]. It can also be converted to alcohol for use as a fuel."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position. A rather primitive wheat, it probably arose through cultivation about 10,000 years ago following a cross between T. aethiopicum (the first primitive wheat) and Aegilops sp. It is sometimes cultivated for its edible seed, especially in N. Africa and the Mediterranean, and it can be grown very successfully under garden conditions[183]. There are some named varieties. 'Kamut' has very large kernels, 2 - 3 times the size of modern wheats. The seed contains significantly higher levels of protein and slightly higher levels of lipids and minerals. Reportedly less allergenic, though this has not been substantiated by controlled studies. The seed is said to have a superior flavour[183]. A tetraploid species[142]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring or autumn in situ and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within a few days[K]. This sub-species is most commonly sown in the spring, though it is also sometimes sown in the autumn[266]."
