See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Fagus cunninghamii.,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Used for joinery, cogs of wheels, furniture etc[154, 156, 167].",,"Prefers an open well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds on most soils but dislikes calcareous soils[1, 200]. Prefers a pH between 5 and 7 but dislikes acid peats[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. They only succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[1]. Young plants at Crarae in western Scotland in 1992 appear to be very hardy and robust[191]. Plants in the wild vary in size from shrubs to very big trees according to rainfall and altitude[11]. Trees have poor wind resistance in Britain, probably because they grow so fast[11]. Another report says that this species is slow growing in cultivation[157]. Trees up to 4 metres tall can be successfully established, though the optimum size for transplanting is about 30 - 80cm. The roots are very sensitive to desiccation and extreme care should be taken when transplanting them[200]. Another report says that the tree transplants badly[154]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cool greenhouse or cold frame. Spring-sown seed requires 2 - 3 months stratification at 1 - 5°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in the cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed must not be allowed to dry out according to one report[80] whilst another says that the seed can be stored dry at 2°c for long periods[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78].
