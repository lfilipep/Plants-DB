Plants enter a semi-dormant state in late summer and they should be kept fairly dry at this time[200]. There must be some doubt over the hardiness of this species. One report says that it is hardy to zone 8 which suggests that it should tolerate occasional cold periods down to between -5 and -10°c, but the report also says that the plants should be protected from frost, with a winter temperatures no lower than 7°c[200].","Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of side shoots in the summer. Dry the stem for 24 hours before planting in a very sandy soil mix[200]. The main stem can also be used, the parent plant will then produce new plantlets at the cut edge[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
