13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Ruscus aculeatus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.8 m (2ft 7in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from January to April, and the seeds ripen from August to March. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

18,Edible Uses,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - cooked[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 11]. They are harvested in the spring as they grow through the soil and used as an asparagus substitute[7, 183]. The taste is pungent and rather bitter[132, 183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[1, 105, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Deobstruent: Clears obstructions from the natural ducts of the body.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vasoconstrictor: Narrows the blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antipruritic  Aperient  Deobstruent  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  VasoconstrictorButcher's broom is little used in modern herbalism but, in view of its positive effect upon varicose veins and haemorrhoids, it could be due for a revival[254]. The root is aperient, deobstruent, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic and vasoconstrictor[4, 7, 238]. It has been taken internally in the past in the treatment of jaundice, gout, and kidney and bladder stones, at the present time it is used to treat venous insufficiency and haemorrhoids[238]. It should not be prescribed for patients with hypertension[238]. It is also applied externally in the treatment of haemorrhoids[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[4]. The whole plant is also sometimes used[4]. This remedy should not be given to people with high blood pressure[254]. The plant contains saponin glycosides, including ruscogenin and neoruscogenin. These substances are anti-inflammatory and cause the contraction of blood vessels, especially veins[254]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Ruscus aculeatus for haemorrhoids (piles) and venous conditions  (see [302] for critics of commission E) [301]."
22,Other Uses,"Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,Scourer: Used for cleaning pots, pans, plates etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"Mature shoots are bound into bunches and used as scourers or as besoms[4, 6, 8, 11, 100, 182]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerant of most soils[11], including chalky and heavy clay soils[200]. Prefers a shady position[1, 31], tolerating dense dry shade and bad growing conditions[186], including the drip-line of trees[182]. Dislikes much wetness at the roots[186]. Established plants are drought resistant[186]. A very hardy plant, when fully dormant it can tolerate temperatures down to about -25°c[187]. Plants have a slowly creeping tough rootstock and eventually form large clumps[187]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants are unusual in that the flowers are produced from the middle of the leaf[4]. Although normally dioecious, some hermaphrodite forms are known[200]. One of these is called 'Sparkler'. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow the seed thinly in early spring in a cold frame in light shade. The seed germinates better if it is given a period of cold stratification. Germination can be rather slow, sometimes taking 12 months or more. Grow the seedlings on in the pot in light shade in the greenhouse for their first growing season, giving occasional liquid feeds to ensure they do not suffer nutrient deficiencies. Prick them out into individual pots in the following spring and grow them on for at least another year in the pots before planting them out in early summer. Be very sure to protect the seedlings from slugs[K]. Division as the plant comes into growth in early spring[186]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
