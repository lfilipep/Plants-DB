13,Summary,"Erythrina verna is a spiny, deciduous shrub or tree growing about 20 m in height with a low, open crown. The trunk can be multi-stemmed and in 40-70 cm in diameter. It can be found in South America particularly in eastern and southern part of Brazil and in Bolivia. It has symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria that forms root nodules and fix atmospheric nitrogen. The bark can be used as a natural sedative to calm agitation and nervous coughs. It can also be used in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, and other nervous system-related conditions. Asthma, bronchitis, gingivitis, hepatitis, inflammation of the liver and spleen, intermittent fevers, and epilepsy are some of the other ailments that can also be treated using the bark of E. verna. The tree is fast-growing and used in reforestation schemes and as a shade tree on cocoa plantations. The wood is light in weight and not durable - it is only used for boxes and paper pulp.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",

20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidepressant: Used to alleviate mood disorders, such as major depression and dysthymia and anxiety disorders such as social anxiety disorder.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Epilepsy: Used in the treatment of Epilepsy - a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidepressant  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Antitussive  Cardiac  Carminative  Epilepsy  Febrifuge  Narcotic  Sedative  UrinaryThe bark of the tree has long been used for medicinal purposes by indigenous peoples in Brazil, especially as a natural sedative. It has been used to calm an overexcited nervous system and promote restful sleep[ 318 ]. The active compounds in the tree have been studied extensively; they have been found to comprise large amounts of novel flavonoids, triterpenes, and alkaloids[ 318 , 739 ]. Twenty isoquinoline alkaloids have been documented for this tree. Many of these have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, cardioactive, narcotic, and sedative activities. One of these alkaloids, 'cristamidine' has been shown to have a positive effect on the liver[ 318 ]. Other alkaloids have shown hypotensive and heart-regulatory activities[ 318 ]. The alkaloid 'erysodine' has been documented with neuromuscular effects characteristic of curare arrow poisons. Two studies also indicate that it might be useful as an anti-nicotine drug, as it demonstrated actions as a competitive antagonist and to block nicotine receptors[ 318 ]. The traditional use of the plant to relieve anxiety and stress has been validated by researchers in a 2002 study, where it was shown that a water-alcohol extract of the plant altered anxiety-related responses. The effect was similar to the commonly-prescribed anti-anxiety drug diazepam[ 318 ]. It was suggested in this study that the alkaloids in Erythrina 'may alter GABAergic neurotransmission.' GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain; abnormalities with its function is implicated in diseases including epilepsy, anxiety, and depression[ 318 ]. Further research has validated the traditional use of the plant as an antimicrobial agent for throat and urinary infections, it had demonstrated antibacterial activity in two studies against Staphylococcus aureus, and antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium smegmatis[ 318 ]. Positive regulatory effects on heart palpitations and decreased blood pressure have been reported[ 318 ]. The bark is antispasmodic, antitussive, calmative and narcotic[ 739 ]. It is considered to be an excellent sedative to calm agitation and nervous coughs and to treat other nervous system problems, including insomnia and anxiety. It also is widely used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, gingivitis, hepatitis, inflammation of the liver and spleen, intermittent fevers, and to clear obstructions in the liver. It is also used in some areas as part of the treatment for epilepsy[ 318 ]. It is also used to quiet hysteria from trauma or shock, as a mild, hypnotic sedative to calm the nervous system, to treat insomnia and promote healthy sleeping patterns (by sedating overactive neurotransmitters), to regulate heart palpitations, and to treat hepatitis and liver disorders.; Dr Donna Schwontkowski, a chiropractor who has used Amazonian plants in her practice, recommends the bark for treating hernias, stomachaches, and epilepsy - and to help augment milk flow as well[ 318 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: Used as a shade-providing tree in cocoa plantations[ 419 ]. A pioneer species, growing fairly fast, attracting the native fauna and fixing atmospheric nitrogen. It can be used in reforestation schemes for restoring native woodland[ 419 ]. Other Uses: The wood is light in weight, smooth, having 68% of fibres when dry, of low durability when exposed to moisture. It is only used for low value items such as boxes and for paper pulp[ 419 ]. Ornamental.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in individual containers. A high germination rate can usually be expected from fresh seed, with the seed sprouting within 10 - 20 days[ 419 ]. The seedlings develop quickly and they should be ready to plant out less than 4 months later[]. Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",
