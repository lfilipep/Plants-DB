The presence of this plant in a truly wild state in Britain is an indicator of ancient woodland[200]. Plants are very slow to flower from seed[137]. The flowers are very long-lived[200]. The flowers emit a strong unpleasant smell rather like decaying meat[245].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in late summer in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as soon as it is received. The seed is very slow to germinate. It produces a primary root about 7 months after sowing, this pulls the seed deeper into the soil. Leaves are produced about 4 months later[137]. Sow the seed thinly so that it does not need to be thinned and grow the young plants on undisturbed in a shady part of the greenhouse for their first two years of growth. Give an occasional liquid feed in the growing season to ensure the plants do not become nutrient deficient. At the end of the second year's growth prick out the young plants into individual pots and grow them on for another year or two in a shady part of the greenhouse before planting them out in the spring.
