0,Crotalaria juncea,Sun Hemp,Fabaceae,10-12,"The seeds of many Crotalaria species contain toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Trichodesmine is the principal toxic alkaloid in Crotalaria juncea[ 303 ]. The seeds are reported to contain trypsin inhibitors; they are said to be poisonous to cattle, and they can poison both horses and pigs[ 303 ].",A tropical plant growing in open sunny positions.,E.

Its stem is erect with silky hairs on the branches. It has a strong taproot and the roots have root nodules. The leaves are spirally arranged, narrow, and simple. The pea-shaped flowers are yellow in colour. The fruit is a pod that is covered with soft hairs, short, inflated and light yellow in colour. The seeds are believed to purify the blood and are used in the treatment of impetigo and psoriasis. The leaves and flowers are edible. The plant is widely grown in the tropics as a green manure, often as a cover crop. The bark yields fibre used in making twine and cord, canvas and fishing nets, and paper and pulp. The fibre is stronger when wet and is resistant to mildew, moisture and microorganisms in salt water.","Crotalaria juncea is a ANNUAL growing to 1.6 m (5ft) by 0.4 m (1ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects. The plant is not self-fertile. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Crotalaria benghalensis Lam. Crotalaria fenestrata Sims Crotalaria porrecta Wall.

As well as producing high organic-matter yields, it can reduce the build-up of root-knot nematode populations[ 303 ]. It is often grown as a cover crop and in rotation with tobacco, vegetables, dry grains, rice, corn, cotton, sugarcane, pineapples, coffee, and orchard crops[ 303 ]. Other Uses A valuable fibre is extracted from the bark[ 303 ]. It is used to make twine and cord; canvas and fishing nets; and paper and pulp[ 303 ]. Sun hemp fibre has greater tensile strength and is more durable under exposure than jute (Corchorus spp), though it is not as strong as hemp (Cannabis sativa)[ 303 ]. The 3 main properties that make sun hemp an excellent candidate for paper-making are 1) good yields of bleachable sulphate pulps, 2) pulp strength properties that are equal to or greater than those of mixed southern hardwood pulp, and 3) length-to-width ratio of bast fibre that is greater than that of wood fibres. Stems are composed of two types of fibre - the bast and the woody core. Bast fibres, located in the outer bark, are much longer than the core fibres, but the widths of both fibres are similar. The proportion of bark in the total stalk by dry weight ranges from 15% to 20%. Sunn hemp fibre is used in twine, rug yarn, cigarette and tissue papers, fishnets, sacking, canvas and cordage.  is stronger when wet; it is fairly resistant to mildew, moisture and microorganisms in salt water[ 303 ].

It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30c, but can tolerate 4 - 40c[ 418 ]. Mature plants can be killed by temperatures of -2c or lower, whilst young growth will be severely damaged at -1c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 500 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 200 - 4,300mm[ 418 ]. Sun hemp is generally sensitive to photoperiod. Long day lengths favour vegetative growth and reduce seed set, although selections exist that are neutral to day length[ 303 ]. Widely adaptable to different soil types[ 303 ]. For fibre production, a light, loamy well-drained soil is preferred; on low-lying or clay soils plants achieve vigorous growth, but the bast fibre is coarser and yields are lower[ 303 ]. Plants are not very tolerant of salty conditions[ 303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5 - 8.4[ 418 ]. Established plants are drought resistant[ 303 ]. When grown as a fibre crop, the plants are usually harvested at the flowering stage or when the stems turn yellow. When the main priority is seed production, the crop is harvested when the seeds are ripe; the fibre is extracted from the stems afterwards[ 303 ]. The production of green plants is normally 40 - 60 tonnes/ha yielding 2.5 - 4.5 tonnes/ha of dry fibre[ 418 ]. There are no significant differences in strength and quality of fibre obtained from plants retted at flowering time and those retted when seeds are fully mature[ 303 ]. The retting period depends on water temperature, locality, time of year, weather conditions, depth and source of water, thickness of stalks, and quantity of straw in relation to volume of water. Cut straw with a yellowish tinge requires 10 - 21 days to bleach out sufficiently to have fibre of a satisfactory colour. Stems cut while green will bleach out when exposed directly to the sun but have to be turned at least twice[ 303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 200 ]. Soybean soils must contain the proper nitrogen-fixing bacteria. When grown on the same land for 2 - 3 successive years, increasing yields are obtained year after year[ 269 ]. Seed can be purchased that has been treated with this rhizobium, it is unnecessary on soils with a pH below 5.5 but can be helpful on other soils[ 206 ]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Seed - sown in situ. Germination is rapid and seedlings emerge 3 days after sowing, soon producing a thick ground cover that smothers weeds[303]. Too much moisture is harmful during the first 2 weeks after germination[ 303 ]. Seeds are ready for harvest when pods begin to turn yellow and seeds rattle in them[ 303 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
