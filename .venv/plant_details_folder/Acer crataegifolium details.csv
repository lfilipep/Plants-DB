0,Acer crataegifolium,Hawthorn-Leaved Maple,Aceraceae,5-9,None known,"Common in temperate deciduous forests, usually growing in open places along mountain paths or at streamsides and in young secondary forests at elevations of 200 - 1100 metres[275].",E. Asia - central and southern Japan.,(0 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AcerCrataegifolium.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Acer crataegifolium is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 10 m (32ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.","The leaves are packed around apples, rootcrops etc to help preserve them[18, 20]. A paste made from the bark is used in paper-making[61].",,"Of easy cultivation, it succeeds in most good soils preferring one that is moist and well-drained[11]. Prefers a sunny position but tolerates some shade[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Chlorosis can sometimes develop as a result of iron deficiency when the plants are grown in alkaline soils, but in general maples are not fussy as to soil pH. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. Most maples are bad companion plants, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants[18, 20]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - this species does not usually hybridise so seed of garden origin is perfectly all right. It is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the following spring. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours and then stratify for 2 - 4 months at 1 - 8°c. It can be slow to germinate. The seed can be harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has dried and produced any germination inhibitors) and sown immediately. It should germinate in late winter. If the seed is harvested too soon it will produce very weak plants or no plants at all[80, 113]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 20cm or more tall before planting them out in their permanent positions. Layering, which takes about 12 months, is successful with most species in this genus. Cuttings of young shoots in June or July. The cuttings should have 2 - 3 pairs of leaves, plus one pair of buds at the base. Remove a very thin slice of bark at the base of the cutting, rooting is improved if a rooting hormone is used. The rooted cuttings must show new growth during the summer before being potted up otherwise they are unlikely to survive the winter. Grafting of cultivars can be carried out using the rootstock from any species in the Macrantha section of this genus, which includes the species A. pensylvanicum which is included in the database.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
