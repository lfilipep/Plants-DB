0,Ilex glabra,Inkberry,Aquifoliaceae,3-7,"Although no specific reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, the fruits of at least some members of this genus contain saponins and are slightly toxic. They can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and stupor if eaten in quantity[274].",Wet acid soils[184]. Low sandy or peaty soils[43].,Eastern N. America - Nova Scotia to Florida and west to Montana.,(1 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Ilex_glabra2.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Ilex_glabra3.JPEG",,"Ilex glabra is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Prinos glaber.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Hedge;,,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","The dried roasted leaves are a good substitute for yaupon tea.

Plants are very slow growing[11] and seldom exceed 1metre in height in British gardens[184]. Plants have stoloniferous roots[182]. This species is closely related to I. coriacea[182]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200]. Resents root disturbance, especially as the plant grows older[1, 11]. It is best to place the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, perhaps giving some winter protection for their first year or two[K]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back into old wood if required[188]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. A report says that some plants are monoecious. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It can take 18 months to germinate. Stored seed generally requires two winters and a summer before it will germinate and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. Scarification, followed by a warm stratification and then a cold stratification may speed up the germination time[78, 80]. The seedlings are rather slow-growing. Pot them up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame for their first year. It is possible to plant them out into a nursery bed in late spring of the following year, but they should not be left here for more than two years since they do not like being transplanted. Alternatively, grow them on in their pots for a second season and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them a good mulch and some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of almost ripe wood with a heel, August in a shaded position in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months before potting up. Layering in October. Takes 2 years.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
