21,Other Uses Description,"A good nurse plant for sites prone to drought. Erosion Control. Invertebrates shelter: beneficial for insects and other arthropods. Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. The flowerheads are pollinated by many kinds of insects, including long-tongued bees, small-tongued bees, wasps, flies, and butterflies. Several bees are oligoleges of Solidago spp. (Goldenrods). These species include: Andrena hirticincta, Andrena nubecula, Andrena placata, Andrena simplex, Andrena solidaginis, and Colletes simulans armata. Many insects feed on the leaves, flowers, seeds, and roots of goldenrods. These insect feeders include plant bugs, stink bugs, aphids, leaf beetles, and the caterpillars of many moths. These insects are a source of food to many woodland songbirds and some upland gamebirds. White-tailed Deer readily browse on the foliage of Zigzag Goldenrod [1-6]. An interesting goldenrod for shady woodland areas [368-1]."
