0,Dalbergia monticola,"Hazovola, tsiandalana, voamboana",Fabaceae,10-12,None known,"Evergreen forests at elevations from 350 - 1,600 metres, usually on ferrallitic soils[ 299 , 752 ].",Africa - eastern Madagascar.,(0 of 5),(4 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Dalbergia-monticola.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Dalbergia monticola 2.jpg","Endemic to Madagascar, Dalbergia monticola is a deciduous tree typically about 15 m in height with a short bole of up to 100 cm in diameter. It has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria that forms root nodules and fix atmospheric nitrogen. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy and ideal for making musical instruments, precision equipment, cabinets and furniture, carvings, and veneer and plywood among others.","Dalbergia monticola is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses: The heartwood is greyish yellow-brown to reddish brown or dark brown, often with darker stripes; it is distinctly demarcated from the sapwood. The grain is generally straight, texture fine and even; when fresh the wood has a sweetish smell. The wood is moderately heavy to heavy; it is moderately durable and resistant to termites. It air-dries satisfactorily but slowly; turned pieces used for precision equipment or musical instruments should be dried thoroughly to avoid distortion. Once dry, the wood is very stable in service. The wood works well, both with hand tools and machine tools; it finishes well, taking a beautiful polish; the nailing properties are moderate and pre-boring is needed; finishing with oil-based paint gives moderate results; the gluing properties are variable. The wood is much in demand for cabinet making, furniture, marquetry and parquet flooring. It is one of the favoured woods for musical instruments, especially guitars, not only because of its beautiful colour and venation, but also because of its clearness of tone. It is also suitable for interior trim, joinery, ship and boat building, vehicle bodies, precision equipment, carvings, toys and novelties, turnery, pattern making, veneer and plywood[ 299 ].",,"A plant of the moister tropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 1,600 metres. It is found in regions where the mean annual temperature is in the range 18 - 23°c, and the mean annual rainfall is 750 - 2,500 mm[ 299 ]. Trees are probably slow-growing[ 299 ]. A long lived plant, surviving for more than 200 years[ 299 ]. Seedlings are rarely found more than 10 - 20 metres from the trunk of the parent tree[ 299 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 299 ].","Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ]. Air layering has been successful on an experimental basis[ 299 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
