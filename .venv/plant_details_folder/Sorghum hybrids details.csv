13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Sorghum hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 3 m (9ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."
15,Synonyms,See individual species/hybrids.
16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb, sugar (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Possible. For example Sorghum bicolor is Astringent, Demulcent, Diuretic, and Haemostatic. Sorghum halepense is Demulcent and Diuretic."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Possible but not reported. Sorghum halepense is a good biomass plant. The plant is a potential source of biomass with yields of up to 19 tonnes per hectare[269]. Sorghum bicolor has been used as Biomass, Brooms, and for Weaving. The flowering panicles are used as brushes brooms and whisks etc[1, 2, 4, 46, 57]. Stems are used for weaving fences, mats, wattle houses etc[178]. The plant is an excellent source of biomass[269]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Hay  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Staple Crop: Sugar  Under DevelopmentClimate: cold temperate to tropical, tropical highlands. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Sorghum is well suited for dry conditions, areas with uneven rainfall distribution that may adversely affect the growing season of other crops, and high year to year variation in rainfall and water supplies. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: under development. Management: standard, hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]. Sorghum is already weakly perennial in the tropics. It ""rattoons"", or resprouts for several years. Perennial breeding at the Land Institution focused on crosses with Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), while other breeders focus on Ni gao liang (Sorghum propinquum). Perennial sorghum could be bread for grain and sweet syrup. Sorghum is particularly suited to dry regions and some promising hybrids have been trialed [1-1].  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow April in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Division in mid spring as the plant comes into new growth. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
