21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibiotic  Antidiarrhoeal  Astringent  Dysentery  Eczema  Hypoglycaemic  Styptic  VulneraryPurple loosestrife is an astringent herb that is mainly employed as a treatment for diarrhoea and dysentery. It can be safely taken by people of all ages and has been used to help arrest diarrhoea in breast-feeding babies[254]. It can also be used to treat heavy periods and inter-menstrual bleeding[254]. Modern research has shown the whole plant to be antibiotic and to be particularly effective against the micro-organism that causes typhus[254]. The flowering plant is antibiotic, highly astringent, hypoglycaemic, styptic and vulnerary[4, 7, 9, 21, 152, 218, 238]. It is valued as an intestinal disinfectant, especially in cases of enteritis[7], an infusion is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, internal bleeding, excessive menstruation etc[9, 222, 238]. The flowering plant is harvested in the summer and can be used fresh or dried[9]. Externally, the plant is used as a cleansing and healing wash for wounds, sores, impetigo, eczema, excess vaginal discharge, vaginal itching etc[7, 222, 238, 254]. The powdered plant is used as a haemostatic in cases of severe nosebleeds[7]. The stems are regarded as gum stimulators and are given to children to chew in order to strengthen weak or bleeding gums[7].",
22,Other Uses,"Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Preservative: For food, or for treating wood, ropes etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A decoction of the plant is impregnated into wood, rope etc to prevent it rotting in water[74]. The leaves contain about 12% tannin, the stems 10.5%, the flowers 13.7% and the roots 8.5%[218]. It is probably these tannins that preserve the wood etc[218]. The powdered plant is used cosmetically in face-packs to counteract reddened skin[7].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Container, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil, especially if it is damp[1]. Prefers a neutral to alkaline soil[238]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Grows well in marshy soils[24] and succeeds in shallow water at the edges of ponds[56]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -25°c[187]. This species can be very invasive and has been declared a noxious weed in some countries. Since being introduced in N. America it has invaded native marshlands, florming large areas of dense stands and crowding out many native species[274]. A very ornamental plant[1]. A good bee and butterfly plant[24]. Plants usually self-sow when well sited[200]. Special Features:Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the autumn or the spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it could be worthwhile trying a sowing in situ in the autumn or the spring. Division in March or October[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings in the spring[238]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
