22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a soil rich in leafmold[90], preferring semi-shade[28, 31] but tolerating full sun. Succeeds in most soils but prefers a heavy one[200]. Succeeds in the dry shade of trees[188, 233]. Bulbs like to be quite deep in the soil[200]. The flowers diffuse a balsam-like scent in the sunshine[245]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring or as soon as ripe in a cold frame. It usually requires stratification. If you have plenty of seed it can be sown in situ, but it is usually more economical to sow it in a frame. If sown thinly, the seedlings can be left in their pots for the first year, though give them regular liquid feeds to make sure that they get sufficient nutrient. Prick out the seedlings about 3 to a pot and grow on for 1 - 2 more years before planting out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. Division of the bulbs in summer after the leaves die down. Larger bulbs can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year in a cold frame before planting them out when dormant in late summer."
