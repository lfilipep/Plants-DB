24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sandy soil[1]. Succeeds in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out in the summer, otherwise it should be grown in partial shade in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Not very hardy in Britain, it is best to give the plants some protection in the winter[1]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Most plants grown under this name in British gardens are actually L. muscari[200]. The Flora of Japan treats L. graminifolia as two separate species, L. minor. (Maxim.)Makino. and L. platyphylla. F.T.Wang.&Tang. The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening recognizes L. graminifolia as a distinct species and gives L. platyphylla as a synonym of L. muscari whilst allotting specific status to L. minor as a plant closely related to L. muscari. This is the treatment followed here.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it in a cold frame or greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if possible, if not then sowing the stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
