24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light loamy soil that is deep and moist but it succeeds in most fertile soils[11, 182]. Prefers a sunny position but it tolerates shade when grown in warm temperate zones[11, 200]. Requires a sheltered position, protected from cold winds[245]. A very ornamental plant, it is often confused with the closely related C. floridus and is perhaps no more than a sub-species of that species[11]. The leaves smell strongly of cinnamon[245]. The seed only ripens in Britain after a hot summer[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. If the seed is harvested 'green' (as soon as it has fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately it can germinate in 3 weeks[113]. Dried seed germinates in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Stored seed requires between 3 weeks and 3 months cold stratification before sowing in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. They can be difficult[113]. Layering in spring. Sever the new plants in a wet spell of weather about 15 months later and then lift them in the autumn[78]. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in early spring[11]. Very easy, they can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",
