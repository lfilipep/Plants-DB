24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a sandy soil[1]. Succeeds in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out in the summer, otherwise it should be grown in partial shade in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Requires a sunny position[208]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190, 200], they succeed in dry shade[190]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[200]. Slow to settle down after being planted but then grows away well[190]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. There is a lot of confusion between this species and L. graminifolia, most of the plants being grown as L. graminifolia actually being this species[200]. Apart from its use as a ground cover plant, all the entries on this plant's uses actually belong to L. graminifolia but, because of the confusion, it is quite possible that they also apply to this species[K]. This species has thick dark tubers whilst L. graminifolia is rhizomatous[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it in a cold frame or greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if possible, if not then sowing the stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, the larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
