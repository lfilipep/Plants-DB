See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",L. platyphylla.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Root - cooked[105, 177].

The roots sometimes have a fleshy, tuberous part near their tip[266].","Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is used as a tonic in Korea to increase stamina and also as an expectorant[279].",,"A good drought tolerant evergreen ground cover plant[200, 208]. Rather slow to spread though, needing weeding for the first year or two[197]. Plants should be spaced about 30cm apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a sandy soil[1]. Succeeds in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out in the summer, otherwise it should be grown in partial shade in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. Requires a sunny position[208]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant[190, 200], they succeed in dry shade[190]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A very ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[200]. Slow to settle down after being planted but then grows away well[190]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. There is a lot of confusion between this species and L. graminifolia, most of the plants being grown as L. graminifolia actually being this species[200]. Apart from its use as a ground cover plant, all the entries on this plant's uses actually belong to L. graminifolia but, because of the confusion, it is quite possible that they also apply to this species[K]. This species has thick dark tubers whilst L. graminifolia is rhizomatous[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it in a cold frame or greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if possible, if not then sowing the stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, the larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
