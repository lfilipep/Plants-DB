A herb tea is made from the fresh or dried leaves[21, 183]. An essential oil from the plant is used as a flavouring in sweets and beverages[183]. The leaves contain about 0.2% essential oil[218]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anaesthetic  Antiphlogistic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Aromatic  Cancer  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Emmenagogue  Febrifuge  Galactofuge  Salve  Stimulant  StomachicJapanese mint, like many other members of this genus, is often used as a domestic herbal remedy, being valued especially for its essential oil[279] which has antiseptic properties and a beneficial effect on the digestion. Like other members of the genus, it is best not used by pregnant women because large doses can cause an abortion. The whole plant is anaesthetic, antiphlogistic, antispasmodic, antiseptic, aromatic, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, galactofuge, refrigerant, stimulant, stomachic and vasodilator[147, 172, 218, 279]. A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, digestive disorders and various minor ailments[222,279]. The leaves are a classical remedy for stomach cancer[218]. The essential oil in the leaves is antiseptic, though it is toxic in large doses[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is used as an insect repellent[18, 20, 99]. Rats and mice intensely dislike the smell of mint. The plant was therefore used in homes as a strewing herb and has also been spread in granaries to keep the rodents off the grain[244]. An essential oil is obtained from the plant[238]. It can be used as a substitute for, or adulterant of, peppermint oil[238]. Yields of up to 1.6% have been obtained[240]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils and situations so long as the soil is not too dry[1, 16, 200]. This species tolerates much drier conditions than other members of the genus[238]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[16]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. A sunny position is best for production of essential oils, but it also succeeds in partial shade. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[238]. Most mints have fairly aggressive spreading roots and, unless you have the space to let them roam, they need to be restrained by some means such as planting them in containers that are buried in the soil[K]. The whole plant has a very strong scent of peppermint[245]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Polymorphic[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[24]. A good companion plant for growing near brassicas and tomatoes, helping to deter insect pests[20]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Mentha species are very prone to hybridisation and so the seed cannot be relied on to breed true. Even without hybridisation, seedlings will not be uniform and so the content of medicinal oils etc will vary. When growing plants with a particular aroma it is best to propagate them by division[K]. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame. They will quickly become established and can be planted out in the summer."
