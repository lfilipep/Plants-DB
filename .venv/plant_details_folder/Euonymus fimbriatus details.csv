This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Often confused with E. lucidus[11], it is also closely related to E. sanguineus[1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 8 - 12 weeks warm followed by 8 - 16 weeks cold stratification and can then be sown in a cold frame[78, 98]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm long taken at a node or with a heel, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]."
