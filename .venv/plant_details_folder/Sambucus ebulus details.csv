The fruit of this species has been known to cause stomach upsets to some people. Any toxin the fruit might contain is liable to be of very low toxicity and is destroyed when the fruit is cooked[65, 76].","Waste ground, woods, hedgerows and scrub. especially on calcareous soils[7, 13].","Europe, including Britain, from the Netherlands south and east to the Mediterranean and Himalayas.",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SambucusEbulus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SambucusEbulus2.jpg",,"Sambucus ebulus is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover; Hedgerow;,Fruit: ,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - cooked. It is used as a flavouring in soups etc[177]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter and is borne in large clusters[200]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Leaves are used as a tea substitute[105, 177]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity.","Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Appetite Suppressant: Reduces appetite.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Purgative: A drastic laxative causing a cleansing or watery evacuation of the bowels, usually with a griping pain.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiphlogistic  Antirheumatic  Appetite Suppressant  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Homeopathy  Poultice  PurgativeThe leaves are antiphlogistic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant and laxative[4, 7, 9, 13, 21, 240]. The fruit is also sometimes used, but it is less active than the leaves[4]. The herb is commonly used in the treatment of liver and kidney complaints[4]. When bruised and laid on boils and scalds, they have a healing effect[4]. They can be made into a poultice for treating swellings and contusions[4]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[7]. The root is diaphoretic, mildly diuretic and a drastic purgative[4, 7, 9]. Dried, then powdered and made into a tea, it is considered to be one of the best remedies for dropsy[4, 240]. It should only be used with expert supervision because it can cause nausea and vertigo[9]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh berries or the bark[9].

The root juice is used to dye hair black[4]. The leaves are said to repel mice and moles[4, 115]. Plants make a dense ground cover when spaced about 1 metre apart each way[208]. They are best used in large areas, roadsides etc[208]. Our experience to date (1995) is that the plants spread vigorously but do not form a dense cover and so do not exclude other plants[K].",,"Tolerates most soils, including chalk[200], but prefers a moist loamy soil[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position[1]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. A very invasive plant, sending up new shoots a metre or more away[K]. It can be used for naturalising in the rougher parts of the garden[233], growing well on rough banks etc[1]. The whole plant, when bruised, emits a most unpleasant fur-like smell[245]. The bark, in particular, smells like stale perspiration[245].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Division of suckers in spring or autumn.
