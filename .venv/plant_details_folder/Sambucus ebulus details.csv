Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Leaves are used as a tea substitute[105, 177]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiphlogistic  Antirheumatic  Appetite Suppressant  Cholagogue  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Homeopathy  Poultice  PurgativeThe leaves are antiphlogistic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant and laxative[4, 7, 9, 13, 21, 240]. The fruit is also sometimes used, but it is less active than the leaves[4]. The herb is commonly used in the treatment of liver and kidney complaints[4]. When bruised and laid on boils and scalds, they have a healing effect[4]. They can be made into a poultice for treating swellings and contusions[4]. The leaves are harvested in the summer and can be dried for later use[7]. The root is diaphoretic, mildly diuretic and a drastic purgative[4, 7, 9]. Dried, then powdered and made into a tea, it is considered to be one of the best remedies for dropsy[4, 240]. It should only be used with expert supervision because it can cause nausea and vertigo[9]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the fresh berries or the bark[9]. It is used in the treatment of dropsy[9]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Ink: Plants that can be used as an ink.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"A blue dye and an ink are obtained from the fruit[13, 46, 61, 115]. The root juice is used to dye hair black[4]. The leaves are said to repel mice and moles[4, 115]. Plants make a dense ground cover when spaced about 1 metre apart each way[208]. They are best used in large areas, roadsides etc[208]. Our experience to date (1995) is that the plants spread vigorously but do not form a dense cover and so do not exclude other plants[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soils, including chalk[200], but prefers a moist loamy soil[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position[1]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. A very invasive plant, sending up new shoots a metre or more away[K]. It can be used for naturalising in the rougher parts of the garden[233], growing well on rough banks etc[1]. The whole plant, when bruised, emits a most unpleasant fur-like smell[245]. The bark, in particular, smells like stale perspiration[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Division of suckers in spring or autumn. Very easy."
