Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Early winter, Late spring, Late winter, Mid spring, Mid winter. Form: Upright or erect.","Mahonia pinnata is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1.8 m (6ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",M. aquifolium fascicularis. M. fascicularis. Berberis pinnata.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 105, 161]. An acid flavour but rather nice raw, especially when added to muesli or porridge[K]. Unfortunately, there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. The fruit is about 6mm in diameter[200].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antirheumatic  Antitumor  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Laxative  Salve  TonicThe bark is antirheumatic and febrifuge[257]. A decoction has been taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, ague, consumption and heartburn[257]. A decoction has been used as a wash for cuts and bruises[257]. The liquid obtained from chewing the roots has been used as a salve and to prevent swelling from wounds and abrasions[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A green dye is obtained from the roots[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Ground cover, Massing. An easily grown plant, it thrives in any good garden soil[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes windy positions[49]. Prefers a shady sheltered position[49]. This species is not fully hardy in the colder parts of Britain[3]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Closely allied to M. aquifolium[67]. It hybridizes freely with other members of the genus. Most plants grown in gardens under this name are in fact hybrids[182]. Plants are resistant to honey fungus[88]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
