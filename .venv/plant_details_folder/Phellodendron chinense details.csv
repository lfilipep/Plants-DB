See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,None known,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Bitter  Cholagogue  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  Hypoglycaemic  Ophthalmic  Skin  Stomachic  Urinary  VasodilatorThis species is used in Chinese herbalism in the same way as P. amurense[238, 254]. These uses are as follows:- Amur cork tree, called Huang Bai in China, is commonly used in Chinese herbalism, where it is considered to be one of the 50 fundamental herbs, but one that should be used with care[218, 254]. A strongly bitter remedy, the bark acts strongly on the kidneys and is regarded as a detoxicant for hot damp conditions[238]. Recent research has shown that the plant is useful in the treatment of meningitis and conjunctivitis[254]. Huang Bai should only be used under professional supervision and should not be take during pregnancy[254]. The bark is alterative, antibacterial, antirheumatic, aphrodisiac, bitter stomachic, cholagogue, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, hypoglycaemic, ophthalmic, skin, vasodilator and tonic[4, 61, 174, 176, 178, 281, 238]. It is taken internally in the treatment of acute diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, vaginal infections including Trichomonas, acute urinary tract infections, enteritis, boils, abscesses, night sweats and skin diseases[238, 254]. It is commonly used in conjunction with Scutellaria baicalensis and Coptis chinensis in a preparation called 'injection of three yellow herbs'[238]. It is given intramuscularly for upper respiratory tract infections[238]. The bark of 10 year old tress is harvested in the winter or spring and dried for later use[238, 254]. The fruit is expectorant[218].",,None known,,"Prefers a moisture retentive well-drained deep rich loam in full sun[11, 200]. Prefers a neutral to alkaline soil[238]. Succeeds on shallow chalky soils[245]. Grows best in areas with long hot summers[200]. Plants are gross feeders and require a rich soil if they are to perform well[11]. Dormant plants are fully hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to at least -20°c[188, 200], but the young growth is liable to damage from late spring frosts[11, 188, 200]. The leaves are aromatic[188]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification, sow in late winter in a cold frame[78, 113]. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in autumn and over winter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Root cuttings - obtain in December and store in leafmold in a warm place for 3 weeks. Cut into 4cm lengths and plant horizontally in pots. Grow on in a warm greenhouse. Good percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
