The rootstock is hardy to about -20°c[200] and plants resprout from the base if they are cut back by winter cold. Plants are only sometimes cut to the ground in the winter[11]. They flower on the current years growth[184] and flower more freely if they are pruned to the ground during the winter. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].
