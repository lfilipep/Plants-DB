22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen. Requires a light or medium well-drained soil and a sunny position[11, 200]. Succeeds on chalk[11]. The rootstock is hardy to about -20°c[200] and plants resprout from the base if they are cut back by winter cold. Plants are only sometimes cut to the ground in the winter[11]. They flower on the current years growth[184] and flower more freely if they are pruned to the ground during the winter. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow February in a warm greenhouse. The germination can be variable. Prick out the seedlings when large enough to handle and overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse for the first winter, planting out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel if possible, July/August in individual pots in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Overwinter the young plants in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in late spring or early summer[11]. Root cuttings 3cm long in December. Good percentage[78]. Suckers. Remove them in the dormant season, preferably towards the end of winter, and plant out into their permanent positions."
