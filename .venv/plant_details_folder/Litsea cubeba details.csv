23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:Grown as a shade tree in plantations[317]. It is planted as a wind-break in tea plantations[310].A fast-growing pioneer species, usually gregarious in open areas, is found along the edge of tropical rain forests and the edges of both lower and upper montane forests[931]. It can be used at the early stages in reforestation projects, and would make a good choice when establishing a woodland garden[K].The tree is planted as a pioneer species in northern Thailand in reforestation projects to restore native woodland - it is planted in degraded woodland and open areas in a mix with various other species that all have the ability to grow fast; produce dense, weed-suppressing crowns; and attract seed-dispersing wildlife, particularly birds and bats[998].Other Uses:The flowers, leaves, and fruit walls are all sources of essential oils[266, 317]. These oils are processed for citral and are also used for their fragrance and medicinal properties[266, 317]. Citral is used for the production of ionones and formerly vitamin A and in essences for cosmetics, foodstuffs and tobacco products[310]. Because of its pleasant citrus-like smell and taste it is a modifier for lemon and lime flavours and a general freshener in fruit flavours[310]The main essential oil, known as 'may-chang oil' is obtained from the fruit[310]. (Though one report says it is obtained from the flowers[317].) This oil is used in perfumery and is also the main source of citral, for which it is commercially cultivated[310]. In perfumery, may chang oil is used as an alternative for verbena oil and lemongrass oil in colognes, household sprays, soaps and air-fresheners[310].An extract of the fruit is used as an ingredient in commercial cosmetic preparations as a perfume[1243].The essential oil obtained from the fruit is used as an ingredient in commercial cosmetic preparations as a masking agent and perfume[1243].An extract of the leaves is used as an ingredient in commercial cosmetic preparations as an antioxidant[1243].The seed contains a fatty oil, from which lauric acid and capric acid are produced[310].The wood is used for general furniture-making and construction[266].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A fast-growing tree[998].Trees produced from cuttings can commence bearing fruit when just 2 - 3 years old[310].All parts of the plant have a pleasant, lemon-like aroma[301, 443].A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[443]. There are also forms of the plant with functioning hermaphrodite flowers[1025]. We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. However, judging by its native range, it could succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus.",
