It is grown in the lowlands in the subtropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24° - 28°c, but can tolerate 12 - 32°c[ 418 ].

Mature trees produce from 23 - 34 kg per tree, possibly more with good management, or 5 - 20 tonnes/ha per year[ 418 ]. Plants sometimes have two distinct flowering periods each year[ 335 ]. Fruiting is improved if the flowers are hand pollinated[ 336 ]. The fruit has good shipping qualities[ 46 ].
