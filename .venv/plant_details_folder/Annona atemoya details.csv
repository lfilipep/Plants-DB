It is grown in the lowlands in the subtropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24° - 28°c, but can tolerate 12 - 32°c[ 418 ]. Plants can tolerate occasional light frosts[ 335 ]. Young trees will not tolerate prolonged temperatures between -3.9 to -6.7?c, whereas mature trees can withstand those temperatures with slight to moderate damage[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 600 - 4,200mm[ 418 ]. Prefers a moist, sandy loam with a pH of around 6[ 200 ].

Mature trees produce from 23 - 34 kg per tree, possibly more with good management, or 5 - 20 tonnes/ha per year[ 418 ]. Plants sometimes have two distinct flowering periods each year[ 335 ]. Fruiting is improved if the flowers are hand pollinated[ 336 ]. The fruit has good shipping qualities[ 46 ]. There are many named varieties[ 301 ]."
