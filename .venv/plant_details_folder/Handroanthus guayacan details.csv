21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The heartwood is olive-brown to reddish-brown, often with lighter or darker fine striping, sometimes tinged with red; rather sharply demarcated from the creamy-white or yellowish sapwood which is 50 - 75mm wide[341 ]. The appearance is frequently oily; yellow-green deposits of lapachol are abundant; the lustre is low to medium; the grain typically interlocked producing a fine, stripe figure on quarter-sawn surfaces; the texture is fine to medium, moderately uniform[341 ]. The wood is hard, dense, durable, resistant to insect attack, resilient and highly resistant to shock[46 , 341 ]. It is reported to be rather difficult to work and inclined to splinter, but it finishes very smoothly, turns well and polishes nicely. It is difficult to glue and pre-boring is necessary before nailing[341 ]. The wood is highly esteemed where available, and is considered excellent for construction purposes, especially where durability is important[331 ]. It is also used for boats, tool handles etc[46 ]. The Cathedral of Panama Vieja contained beams of this wood, and these were reported to be perfectly sound after having been exposed to the weather since the destruction of the city some 250 years previously[331 ]."
