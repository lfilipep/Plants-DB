See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower all year, and the seeds ripen all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Hedge;,"Flowers: ,Shoots: ","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","The flower buds are pickled in vinegar and then used like capers in salads[183].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.BachGorse has never played much of a role in herbal medicine, though its flowers have been used in the treatment of jaundice and as a treatment for scarlet fever in children[4]. The seed is said to be astringent and has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea and stones[4]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Hopelessness' and 'Despair'[209].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fertilizer: Provides a concentrated solid plant food.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soap making: Plants used as an ingredient in making soaps. Does not include the essential oils, dyes and oils that are also used in making soap.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.","A beautiful yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[4]. It is orange according to another report[168]. Gorse is very tolerant of maritime exposure, it can be used as a windbreak hedge in the most exposed positions, making an impenetrable barrier with its vicious thorns[4, 49, 75, 200]. Planted for soil stabilization on sandy substrates[200], it is very good for stabilizing roadside banks on poor soils[186]. Gorse is an excellent pioneer species for poor soils and areas with maritime exposure. It is fast-growing, feeds the soil with nitrogen and provides good conditions for woodland trees to become established. These trees will eventually out-compete the gorse, which is unable to reproduce well in the shady conditions and will thus gradually die out[K]. The plant has an old reputation as a pesticide, the soaked seed being used against fleas[4]. The wood burns very well, it was much used in the past for kindling, heating bakers ovens etc[11, 66]. The ashes from the burnt wood are rich in potassium and can be used in making soap[4, 115]. This soap can be made by mixing the ashes with a vegetable oil, or mixing them with clay and forming them into balls[4]. The ashes are also an excellent fertilizer[4, 115].",,"An easily grown plant, it requires a poor soil and a sunny position to be at its best[11]. It does well on dry sunny banks or in poor gravelly soils[11]. It is intolerant of shade, nor does it do well on rich soils[11, 182]. Prefers a neutral to slightly acid soil[200], disliking alkaline soils[17]. Plants are very intolerant of root disturbance[11]. Very tolerant of maritime exposure and, once established, drought[75, 186, 200]. Although native to Britain and said to be hardy to about -20°c[184], gorse often suffers badly in severe winters[4, 17], but the plants usually recover[186]. They often accumulate dry dead spines at their centre, this can be a fire risk in dry summers[186, 200]. The plants often resprout from the base after a fire[200] and, even if killed, numerous seedlings will soon spring up to replace the dead plants[186]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. The flowers are strongly scented of coconut[K]. Another report says that the flowers have a smell of vanilla with undertones of orange or pineapple[245]. It is one of the most refreshing of all flower scents[245]. A food plant for the caterpillars of several lepidoptera species[30]. Plants often form dense thickets and these are ideal nesting areas for many species of birds[186]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].","Seed - pre-soak 24 hours in hot water and sow in individual pots in a greenhouse in late winter to early spring. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Plants are very intolerant of root disturbance and so should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible, though not until after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in spring as soon as rooting commences and plant out into their permanent positions as soon as possible[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
