The fruit is eaten fresh or dried for later consumption. Almondette has an almond-flavoured seeds known as 'charoli' that is used mainly in India as a cooking spice and dessert.

Gum obtained from the tree is used as treatment for leprosy. The roots, on the other hand, are used against diarrhoea, the leaves against skin ailments, and the fruits against coughs and asthma. The wood of Almondette is of poor quality hence usage is limited as firewood and for charcoal-making. Seeds are known as charoli or chironji.
