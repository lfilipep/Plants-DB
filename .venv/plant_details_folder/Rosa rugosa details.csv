0,Rosa rugosa,"Ramanas Rose, Rugosa rose",Rosaceae,3-9,There is a layer of hairs around the seeds just beneath the flesh of the fruit. These hairs can cause irritation to the mouth and digestive tract if ingested.,Sandy sea shores[58].,"E. Asia - N. China, Japan, Korea. Naturalized in several places in Britain[17].",(5 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RosaRugosa2.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RosaRugosa.jpg",,"Rosa rugosa is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",R. ferox.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 2, 62]. They are very sweet and pleasant to eat, though it takes quite a bit of patience to eat any quantity[K]. The fruit is a fairly large size for a rose with a relatively thick layer of flesh[K]. The fruit is about 25mm in diameter[200]. Rich in vitamin C[3, 14], containing up to 2.75% dry weight[74]. Some care has to be taken when eating this fruit, see the notes above on known hazards. Flowers - raw or cooked[183]. An aromatic flavour, they are also used in jellies and preserves[74, 183]. Remove the bitter white base of the petals before using them. Young shoots - cooked and used as a potherb[183]. Harvested as they come through the ground in spring and are still tender. The seed is a good source of vitamin E, it can be ground into a powder and mixed with flour or added to other foods as a supplement[102, 183]. Be sure to remove the seed hairs[102]. A pleasant tasting fruity-flavoured tea is made from the fruit, it is rich in vitamin C[21]. A tea is also made from the leaves[218].","Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Hepatic: Acts on the liver (for better or worse!).,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cancer  Hepatic  Vitamin CThe leaves are used in the treatment of fevers[218]. The flowers act on the spleen and liver, promoting blood circulation[147, 218]. They are used internally in the treatment of poor appetite and digestion, and menstrual complaints arising from constrained liver energy[238]. The root is used in the treatment of coughs[218]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].","Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","The plant makes a good low hedge[1, 29]. It is very tolerant of maritime exposure, but is very bare in winter[K].",,"Prefers a light well-drained soil but succeeds in most soils including dry ones[11, 14, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[200]. Prefers a circumneutral soil and a sunny position[200]. Dislikes water-logged soils[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[14, K]. Plants are said to withstand temperatures down to -50°c without damage[160]. The foliage is said to resist disease[11]. A very ornamental plant[1], it suckers freely but these are fairly easily controlled[K]. There are a number of named varieties[11]. 'Scabrosa' is said to be larger in all its parts, including the fruit[200], though it has not proved to be much larger with us[K]. The flowers have a clove-like perfume[245]. Grows well with alliums, parsley, mignonette and lupins[18, 20]. Dislikes boxwood[18]. Garlic planted nearby can help protect the plant from disease and insect predation[18, 20]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[80]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed. Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat[80]. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate[80]. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested[80]. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°c[200]. It may take 2 years to germinate[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July in a shaded frame. Overwinter the plants in the frame and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth. Select pencil thick shoots in early autumn that are about 20 - 25cm long and plant them in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[78, 200]. The cuttings can take 12 months to establish but a high percentage of them normally succeed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Layering. Takes 12 months[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
