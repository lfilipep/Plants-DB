0,Erythronium albidum mesochoreum,Prairie Trout Lily,Liliaceae,4-8,"Although no records of toxicity have been seen for this species, the following notes have been seen for another member of this genus and so some caution is advised. Skin contact with the bulbs has been known to cause dermatitis in sensitive people[65].","Woods, thickets and meadows[43, 90]. Prairies and dry woods in Texas[274].","N. America - Iowa and Nebraska to Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Erythronium albidum mesochoreum is a BULB growing to 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",E. mesochoreum. Kuerr.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"Bulb - raw or cooked[105, 161]. Rather small, it is about 20mm long[235]. The bulbs are eaten avidly by children[257]. Young leaves - raw or cooked. Crisp, tasty, tender and mild when eaten raw[183]. Eating the leaves will greatly reduce the vigour of the bulb, so can only be recommended in times of emergency[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Prefers slightly acid soil conditions but succeeds in chalky soils if these contain plenty of humus[164]. Requires semi-shade, preferably provided by trees or shrubs, and a well-drained soil[164]. Succeeds in almost any light soil, preferring one that is rich in humus[1]. This species is unsatisfactory in cultivation outdoors in Britain. It comes into growth early in the year and the flowers probably need more heat than our typical spring provides if they are to open properly[90]. Because stolons are absent in Erythronium mesochoreum, most plants in a population produce flowers; nonflowering plants may sometimes appear after flowering plants have flowered[270]. Flowers are produced in 3 - 4 years from seed[164]. This species does not produce offsets[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a cold frame. Water lightly in summer, it should germinate in autumn or winter[164, 200]. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification[164]. Sow as early in spring as possible in a cold frame. Sow the seed thinly so that it will not be necessary to prick them out for their first year of growth. Give an occasional liquid feed to the seedlings to make sure that they do not become nutrient deficient. When the plants are dormant, pot up the small bulbs putting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on in a shady position in the greenhouse for another 2 3 years and then plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant in late summer. Division in summer as the leaves die down. This species does not produce offsets[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
