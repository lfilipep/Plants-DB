See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,"Fruit - raw or cooked[183]. They can also be used in jellies, preserves etc or as a flavouring[183]. The whole fruit, rind as well, is eaten raw. It is best to first squeeze and massage the fruit in order to combine the flavours of the flesh and the rind[183]. After ripening the fruit gradually loses water content, becomes richer in flavour and is then at its best for making preserves[183]. The fruit is up to 4cm in diameter[200]. The fruit is rich in pectin, the inner peel containing about 10%[218].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Prefers a pH of 5 to 6[200]. Plants are intolerant of water logging[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, when dormant it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Kumquats are sometimes cultivated in China for their edible fruit, there are some named varieties[200]. They are hardier than the various Citrus species since they cease growth when temperatures drop below 13°c but, for best results, they are best grown in a climate where temperatures do not fall lower than between 4 and 10°c[3]. This is because the fruit is sweeter when it ripens in warm conditions[3].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm airy position in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts and give some winter protection from the cold for a year or two.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
