See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Garcinia morella pedicellata Hanbury,,None known,,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The gum resin obtained from the trunk is a drastic purgative, an emetic, and a vermifuge used for treating tape worm[303 , 310 ]. It is no longer used in human medicine[303 ]. Gamboge is odourless and tasteless or slightly acid[303 ]. Large doses of gamboge, administered as a medicine, can be fatal[303 ].",,"The tree is valued because of the resinous sap, called gamboge, which exudes from incisions in the bark[303 , 310 ]. This sap is used as a golden-yellow colouring matter for varnishes, lacquer, paints, and ink[303 ]. It is used as pigment in water colours[317 ]. The reddish-yellow to brownish-orange sap contains 70 - 80% resin and 15 - 25% gum[303 ]. The main acidic component of the resin is cambogic acid (C38H44O8)[303 ]. The main components of the gum are arabinose (ca. 50%), and galactose (ca. 40%); the gum is soluble in water, where it forms a yellow emulsion[303 ]. The wood is pale or brownish-yellow, straight grained, with fine texture, and fairly heavy, weighing about 900 kg/m. It is moderately hard and works easily; it takes a fine polish[303 ]. It is sometimes used for interior work[303 ]. Carbon Farming: An industrial crop - hydrocarbon.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the moist, lowland tropics, where it grows at elevations up to 800 metres[303 ]. It is found in areas where the annual rainfall is up to 2,500 mm[303 ]. Trees are not usually tapped before they are 20 years old, when the trunk has attained a diameter of about 15 cm[303 , 310 ]. A spiral incision is made in the trunk just below the lowest branches, and the exudate is collected in a bamboo container[303 ]. About every 3 days the content is poured into smaller bamboo stem parts (about 75 cm long), in which the gum-resin coagulates in about a month or longer[303 ]. The bamboo containers are then cracked and the gamboge is removed in cylindrical sticks (pipe gamboge), which is the usual form in trade. Sometimes gamboge is moulded and pressed into cakes[303 ]. The gum-resin obtained from this plant is often called Siamese gamboge to distinguish it from the similar product from the bark of G. Morella, which is called Indian gamboge[303 ]. The species are closely related, and this species has been treated in the past as a variety of G. Morella[303 ]","Seed - we have no specific information on this species, but the seed of most members of the genus can be slow to germinate, even if sown fresh, often taking 6 months or more[K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
