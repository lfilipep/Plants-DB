20,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making."
21,Other Uses Description,"A fibre is obtained from the leaves. Traditionally the N. American Indians would take just the one outside fibre from each side of a leaf. This must have necessitated using a huge number of leaves. It makes a beautifully strong and pliable cord or rope[92]. The fibre can also be used for making paper[189] The leaves are harvested in summer after the plant has flowered, they are scraped to remove the outer skin and are then soaked in water for 2 hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 24 hours with lye and then beaten in a ball mill for 3 hours. They make a light tan paper[189]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a well-drained rather dry sandy soil in partial shade[187]. Requires a lime-free soil[79]. Prefers a good leafy soil[42]. Plants resent root disturbance, they should be pot grown and planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible. Any moving is best carried out in early September[1]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, particularly other Pacific coast irises[129]. Iris purdyi hybridizes with I. bracteata, I. chrysophylla, I. douglasiana, I. innominata, I. macrosiphon, I. tenax, and I. tenuissima[270]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division, best done after flowering. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
