It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October.

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich well-drained moisture retentive soil[11, 200]. Prefers a slightly acid soil but tolerates some alkalinity if plenty of organic matter is added to the soil[200]. Requires some protection from the most intense sunlight[200]. Prefers light shade but tolerates full sun if the soil is reliably moist and the roots are in shade[202]. Plants are intolerant of drought[K]. The fully dormant plant is hardy to about -15°c[184], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants are of slow to moderate growth rate[202]. The shoots are semi-twining, but plants often require some support buy tying the plant in[202]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200, 238]. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a greenhouse in the spring[238]. Germination can be slow and erratic. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for their first 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August in a frame. Overwinter in the greenhouse and plant out in late spring[11, 78]. Good percentage[78]. Layering of long shoots in the autumn[200]."
