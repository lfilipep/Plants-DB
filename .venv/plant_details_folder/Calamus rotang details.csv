13,Summary,"Rattan Cane or Calamus rotang is a dioecious rattan palm that grows up to 10 m tall and 200 m wide. It is native to India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar but can now be found throughout Southeast Asia. The leaves are pinnate, alternate and with spines on the upper face. The flowers are clustered and enclosed by spiny spathes. Young shoots are cooked and eaten as vegetables. The fruits are edible as well and yield an astringent red resin known as 'Dragon's blood. Dragon's blood is used as a dye, in painting, and in medicine against respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. It is also used as a treatment for wounds, diarrhoea, fever, dysentery, mouth ulcers, and skin conditions. The wood of C. rotang is also used medicinally to expel intestinal worms. The leaves are used for biliousness and blood diseases, and the root for fevers and as an antidote to snake venom. C. rotang yields the best rattan cane among other species. It is split into strips and plaited, used in baskets, chairs, and carriages, made into ropes, etc.",
