17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.,Wild Staple Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Cardiotonic: A tonic for the heart.,Hypotensive: Reduces blood pressure, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Antitussive  Cancer  Cardiotonic  Hypotensive  SedativeYan Hu Suo is an important Chinese remedy that has been used for hundreds of years to help 'invigorate the blood' and relieve almost any painful condition[254]. It is used especially to relieve menstrual cramps, chest and abdominal pains[254]. The plant contains powerful alkaloids that are responsible for this effect[254]. The root is analgesic, antiseptic, antispasmodic and sedative[176, 218]. It has traditionally been used to lower pain and strengthen the circulation[218]. It is used in the treatment of a wide range of ailments including lumbago, dysmenorrhoea, hernia, chest pains, insomnia and traumatic injuries[176, 218]. The root is harvested in late spring or early summer, once the top growth has died down, and is dried for later use[254]. Various extracts from the plant have shown antitussive, cardiotonic, hypotensive and anticancer activity[218]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a moist, well-drained rather light soil, thriving in semi-shade[1]. Grows well in a woodland garden or peat bed. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, the seed rapidly loses viability if it is allowed to become dry[129]. Surface sow and keep moist, it usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. Germinates in spring according to another report[129]. Two months warm, then a cold stratification improves the germination of stored seed[134, 164]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be allowed to grow undisturbed in the pot for their first year. Apply liquid feed at intervals during their growing season to ensure they are well fed. The seedlings only produce one leaf in their first year of growth[175] and are very prone to damping off[129]. Divide the seedlings into individual pots once they have become dormant and grow them on in a partially shaded area of a greenhouse for at least another year. Plant them out into their permanent positions when they are dormant. Division after flowering."
