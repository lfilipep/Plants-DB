See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. The flowers are pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",See individual species/hybrids.,,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Oil: Oil,Pollen: ,Oil: ",rming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. Maize/corn is one of the most important staple crops on the planet. The Land Institute has made substantial progress developing a perennial corn. Researchers believe it will be between 10 and 40 years before it is fully ready. Recently the US Department of Agriculture has shown interest [1-1].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The annual Zea mays has a number of medical properties so in theory hybrids could too.,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","Perennial hybrids will carry some of the qualities of the original species. Zea mays for example has agroforestry uses being grown as a sole crop or in intercropping with other food crops such as common bean, cowpea, pigeon pea, groundnut, yam, cassava, sweet potato, pumpkin, melon or watermelon[299 ]. Maize grows well with early potatoes, legumes, dill, cucurbits and sunflowers[18 , 20 , 201 ], it dislikes growing with tomatoes[20 ]. Other Uses include a starch is obtained from the seed. It is used as a laundry starch and as a source material for many chemical products, including glues, cosmetics and the manufacture of glucose[13 , 61 , 299 ]. A semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[57 ]. It has many industrial uses, in the manufacture of linoleum, paints, varnishes, soaps etc[21 , 61 , 299 ]. The corn spathes are used in the production of paper, straw hats and small articles such as little baskets[74 , 171 ]. They are often used to wrap foods, and may also be made into cloth or mats, and be used for mattress filling[299 ]. A fibre obtained from the stems and seed husks is used for making paper[189 ]. They are harvested in late summer after the seed has been harvested, they are cut into usable pieces and soaked in clear water for 24 hours. They are then cooked for 2 hours in soda ash and then beaten in a ball mill for 1½ hours in a ball mill. The fibres make a light greenish cream paper[189 ]. Be careful not to overcook the fibre otherwise it will produce a sticky pulp that is very hard to form into paper[189 ]. The dried cobs are used as a fuel and for thatching[171 , 299 ]. The pith of the stems is used as a packing material[171 ].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.","Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Under DevelopmentClimate: cold temperate to tropical, tropical highlands.
