3,USDA hardiness,3-8
4,Known Hazards,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Open woods, thickets, pastures, along streams etc, with a preference for calcareous soils[228]."

14,Physical Characteristics,"Malus ioensis is a deciduous Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 159, 183, 257]. Up to 4cm in diameter[229]. Harsh and astringent[1, 227, K], it is best baked or made into preserves. It makes excellent jellies and cider[229]."

22,Other Uses,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.
23,Other Uses Description,- heavy. Of no commercial importance[229]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes chalky soils, this is especially true for the cultivar 'Plena'[200]. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[200]. A slow-growing and short-lived species in the wild[229], it produces suckers from the roots and often forms thickets[228]. This species is closely related to M. coronaria[1]. It hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]. There are many named forms, selected for their ornamental value[200]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. The plant fruits very heavily in southern Britain[K]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11]."
