Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The sap is used for treating ulcers and skin eruptions[348 ] The bark is astringent, emetic and stimulant[348 ].An infusion is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, intestinal colic, erysipelas and inflammations[739 ]. The bark is boiled with water and used to induce vomiting[348 ]. The macerated bark is soaked in water and drunk as an anti-diarrhoeal[348 ]. Juice from the bark is applied externally as an analgesic for cracked heels[348 ]. An infusion of the bark is used as a wash for cleaning contusions and ulcers[739 ]. A decoction of the bitter red sap from the bark is gargled or drunk to treat thrush and sores of the mouth. The sap becomes resinous on exposure to air and is then used to relieve the pain of toothache and to cauterize aphthae[348 ]. An exudate from the bark is worked into preparations with psychotropic properties by the native peoples of S. America[739 ].",,"The seed yields an oil formerly used as illuminating oil[348 ]. The oil is used for making candles and soap[378 ]. The seeds burn readily with a clear light. Native people stick them on a thin piece of hard wood and use them as torches when they have to go out in the dark[551 ]. Cut or damaged trees exude a blood-red, watery latex that is similar to the kino of commerce[378 ]. The heartwood is a uniform light reddish, greyish or brown; merging gradually into the pale golden to pale rose-brown sapwood[341 ]. The wood is straight-grained; medium-textured; with a medium to high lustre; odour and taste indistinct. It is moderately heavy; of low durability; very susceptible to termite and pinhole borer attack[341 , 419 ]. It works easily with ordinary tools and finishes well; nails and screws easily without splitting; it can be stained, varnished and polished with good results; turns satisfactorily; glues readily[341 ]. It is used for construction, internal finishing in buildings, toys, light boxes etc, and is suitable for making toothpicks[341 , 419 ].","Industrial Crop: Oil: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, biomass, glycerin, soaps, lubricants, paints, biodiesel. Oilseed crop types.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Oil  Management: Standard  Regional CropGrows best in a sunny position[419 ]. Newly planted young trees are fairly slow to grow away, rarely surpassing 2 metres in height in the second year[419 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[556 ].","Seed - it has a limited viability and should be sown as soon as it is ripe. Sow in individual containers in a lightly shaded position. Germination rates are generally less than 30%, the seed sprouting within 30 - 50 days[419 ].
