18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The following use is reported for L. graminifolia, but there is a lot of confusion between members of this genus (compare [58] and [200]) and it is quite possible that the root of this species is also used[K]. Root - cooked[105, 177, 179]. Candied and used medicinally[61]. The roots are usually with fusiform with a fleshy, tuberous part near the tip[266]. Rich in mucilage, the root also contains about 1.6% protein, 0.5% fat, 80% carbohydrate and 2.3% ash[179]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being."

Plants have been grown indoors in pots in order to help remove toxins from the atmosphere. It is especially good at removing ammonia[259]."

Succeeds in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out in the summer, otherwise it should be grown in partial shade in any moderately fertile well-drained soil[200]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing it in a cold frame or greenhouse as soon as the seed is ripe if possible, if not then sowing the stored seed in early spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Very easy, the larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
