This species is well suited to the front of a peat border[200]. Tubers should be planted about 15cm deep[233]. Only plant out full sized tubers and mulch them with organic matter in the winter[200]. Plants require protection from slugs[200].

Stored seed remains viable for at least a year and can be sown in spring in the greenhouse but it will probably require a period of cold stratification. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least a coupe of years until the corms are more than 20mm in diameter. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst they are dormant.
