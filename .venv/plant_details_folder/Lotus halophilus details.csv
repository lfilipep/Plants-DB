24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The plants use was listed for L. villosus and the report did not cite the author. We have found two authors for that name, L. villosus. Forsk. is listed as a synonym for L. halophilus (the treatment we have used here) and there is also L. villosus. Burm.f. to which this report might more properly apply. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Dislikes shade[200]. Does well on poor soils[61]. A good bee plant[74]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in situ in the spring or the autumn. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 15°c. If seed is in short supply, it can be sown in pots in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer."
