Requires a moist well-drained lime-free soil in sun or light shade[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures that occasionally fall to about -5°c[260]. It succeeds on a wall in Cornwall, mixing well with Passiflora species through which it intertwines[1, 166]. Plants from the Tablelands in Australia tolerate at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157]. This cannot be translated directly to British gardens, however, due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters[K]. Any pruning is best carried out immediately after the plant has flowered[219]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Scarify the seed or pre-soak it for 24 hours in warm water[157, 200]. Sow spring in a warm greenhouse at 20°c[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least its first winter outdoors.
