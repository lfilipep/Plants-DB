The plant contains digitalis-like substances (these are commonly found in Digitalis species and are used in treating heart complaints) and is thought to possess heart tonic properties[268]. It has also been considered good for the treatment of excessive alcohol intake[4]. The whole plant is aromatic, astringent and bitter[4, 7, 9]. The plant is usually applied externally[7]. It is harvested as it comes into flower in late spring and dried for later use[4, 7]. It is also commonly used fresh in ointments and medicated oils[238]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the whole plant. It is widely used in various preparations against throat irritations and especially in the treatment of mouth ulcers[7].",

Fairly fast growing but it does not always smother out weeds and can become bare at the centre if not growing in good conditions[197]. Perennial groundcover for zone 2 firebreaks. The US government has created a system of firebreaks for areas prone to wildfires, theses are separated into concentric zones surrounding buildings. Zone 2 is the second away from the house. These low-level groundcovers provide little fuel.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen, Woodland garden. Prefers a humus-rich, moisture retentive soil and partial shade[28, 31, 200]. Does well in marshy soil and in the spring meadow[24]. Grows well in dry shade[187, 190] and is fairly drought tolerant once established, though it shows distress in severe drought[190]. Plants do not always ripen their seeds in Britain, they spread freely by runners, however, and soon form an extensive patch in suitable conditions[4]. A number of forms have been selected for their ornamental value, several of them are variegated and these are used especially as ground cover plants for dry shade[187]. A purple-leafed form, 'Atropurpurea' does well in full sun so long as the soil is not dry[208]. A good bee and butterfly plant[24].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Naturalizing. Heat Zone: 9-1.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 10°c[133], though it can be erratic[238]. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer[K]. Division of runners at almost any time of year. Very easy, the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",
