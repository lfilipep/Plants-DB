Amboina or Neolamarckia cadamba is a fast-growing tropical and evergreen tree native to South and Southeast Asia that grows up to 45 m tall and 160 cm in trunk diameter. The bole is straight and cylindrical. Flowering commence four or five years after planting, with orange and fragrant flowers that form into globose clusters. Such characteristic makes Ambiona as one of the most planted ornamental trees. The fruit of Amboina is small, fleshy, and yellow-orange. It is reportedly edible as well as the inflorescences. The fast growth rate of this tree makes it suitable for reforestation projects and as windbreaks. It is also used as green manure. The root bark yields yellow dye while the flowers yield essential oil. The wood is easy to work with but non-durable. It is used for light construction, pulp and paper, boxes, crates, and furniture components. The dried bark is used in the treatment of fever and as a tonic.","Neolamarckia cadamba is an evergreen Tree growing to 45 m (147ft) by 30 m (98ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq.

It is fast growing and suitable for reforestation in watersheds and eroded areas and for windbreaks in agroforestry systems. It is also excellent as a shade tree for dipterocarp line planting[325 ] Trees shed large amounts of leaf and non-leaf litter, which on decomposition improve some physical and chemical properties of the soil under their canopy. This reflects in increases in the level of soil organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, available plant nutrients and exchangeable bases[303 ]. Other Uses: The fresh leaves are sometimes used as serviettes or plates[303 ]. A yellow dye can be obtained from the root bark[303 ]. The flowers are the source of an essential oil[303 ]. They are an important raw material in the production of 'attar', which are Indian perfumes with sandalwood (Santalum spp.) base in which one of the essences is absorbed through hydro-distillation[303 ]. Extracts of the flowers exhibit nematicidal effects on Meloidogyne incognita[303 ]. The wood is white with a light yellow tinge becoming creamy yellow on exposure; the sapwood is not clearly differentiated from the heartwood[303 ]. The wood has a density of 290-560 kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low lustre and has no characteristic odour or taste. It is easy to work with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. However, the wood is rated as non-durable, graveyard tests in Indonesia show an average life in contact with the ground of less than 1.5 years. The timber air dries rapidly with little or no degrade. The wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems. The timber is used for plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and furniture components. The tree yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a handsheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength[303 ].",,"A plant of the moister tropics, it grows well at an altitude range of 300 - 800 metres[303 ]. It prefers a mean annual temperature of around 23°c and is sensitive to frost[303 ]. It grows best with a mean annual rainfall of around 1,600mm or more, but can tolerate dry areas with as little as 200mm of rain[303 , 325 ]. Prefers well drained entisols[303 ]. It does not grow well on leached and poorly aerated soils[303 ]. Older trees require good light conditions, the saplings, however, require protection some shade from the hot sun[303 ]. Trees are sensitive to frost, drought and excessive moisture[303 ]. Trees can tolerate periodic flooding[325 ]. Young trees usually grow fast for the first 6 - 8 years, commencing flowering around the age of 4 years[303 ]. When grown for timber, they are usually felled at around the age of 10 - 15 years[303 ]. The tree coppices well[303 ]. The fragrant orange flowers attract insect pollinators[303 ]. Flowering Time: Late Summer/Early Fall Mid Fall Late Fall/Early Winter. Bloom Color: Gold (Yellow-Orange). Spacing: 20-30 ft. (6-9 m) 30-40 ft. (9-12 m) over 40 ft. (12 m).","Seed - best sown in a nursery - direct sowing is not very successful because of the small-sized seeds and the their sensitivity to drought, excessive moisture and direct sun[303 ]. The epigeous germination begins in about 10 - 14 days in the rainy season[303 ]. When the seedlings are 8 - 12 weeks old, they are transplanted to nursery beds or plastic bags. It is recommended to use a medium that is enriched with organic matter[325 ]. After 6 - 7 months, when the seedlings are about 30cm tall, they are ready for transplanting into the field. They can be planted bare-rooted with little loss in survival rate[325 ]. The young seedlings are highly susceptible to weeds and should be weeded regularly. 2-month seedlings can be transplanted in nursery beds or into polythene bags, where they can be retained before planting at the start of the monsoon rains. To ensure successful establishment, seedlings should be planted out with their balls of earth[303 ]. Successful extraction of seed from ripe fruits involves air drying, crushing, and sieving through a No. 35 US Standard sieve to separate seed from chaff[303 ]. The fruits are first soaked in the open until rotted, then ground by hand into a thick slurry, air dried, and passed through a series of sieves terminating with a No. 35. This procedure improves seed purity up to 98%, and germination success[303 ].
