22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soils[200], but prefers a good loamy soil, abundant moisture and full sunlight[11, 200]. Prefers a moist lime-free soil[182], plants quickly become chlorotic on chalk soils[200]. A very cold hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[11]. A rampant suckering shrub, it quickly produces dense thickets and can be used for large-scale naturalistic plantings[200]. It is apt to get thin and poor unless divided up fairly regularly and replanted in fairly good soil[1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if possible. It is likely to require stratification before it germinates, so stored seed should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as you receive it. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a light sandy soil a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15cm long, October/November in an outdoor frame[200]. Another report says that September is a good time to do this[11]. Division of suckers in early spring[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions.",
