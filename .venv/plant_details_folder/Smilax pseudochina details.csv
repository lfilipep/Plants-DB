It is in flower from June to July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",Smilax tamnifolia. Smilax pseudo-china,,Shoots: ,,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 95, 102]. Rich in starch, it can be dried and ground into a powder[46, 161] or made into jelly, fritters etc[105]. Very tender, it is nice raw[178]. Young shoots - cooked. Used as an asparagus substitute[2, 102, 105].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The wilted leaves have been used as a poultice on boils[257].",,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. This species is said to be the true 'China root' of Chinese herbal medicine[178]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most soils in sun or semi-shade[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow March in a warm greenhouse[1]. This note probably refers to the tropical members of the genus, seeds of plants from cooler areas seem to require a period of cold stratification, some species taking 2 or more years to germinate[K]. We sow the seed of temperate species in a cold frame as soon as we receive it, and would sow the seed as soon as it is ripe if we could obtain it then[K]. When the seedlings eventually germinate, prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year, though we normally grow them on in pots for 2 years. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in early spring as new growth begins[238]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots, July in a frame[238].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
