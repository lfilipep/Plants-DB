24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a very well-drained sandy soil in a sunny position[42]. Bulbs can be harvested after the plants have died down in July, stored in a cool dry place and then replanted in October[1]. This species is closely related to T. linifolia and T. maximowiczii[90].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a shady part of the cold frame as soon as it is ripe in early summer[1], or in the early autumn[200]. A spring sowing of stored seed in the greenhouse also succeeds[K]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be grown on without disturbance for their first growing season - apply liquid feeds to the pot if necessary. Divide the bulbs once the plants have become dormant, putting 3 - 4 bulbs in each pot. Grow the on in the greenhouse for at least the next year, planting them out when dormant. Division of offsets in July. Larger bulbs can be planted out straight into their permanent positions, or can be stored in a cool place and then be planted out in late autumn. It is best to pot up smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out when they are dormant in late summer to the middle of autumn.",
