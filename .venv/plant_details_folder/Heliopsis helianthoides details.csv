13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Heliopsis helianthoides is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 1.2 m (4ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects, Birds. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,The flowers have a mild taste and can be used as a garnish or in a salad [318-1].,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Febrifuge  MalariaOx-eye has been used in medicinal drinks, for treatment of lung troubles. The leaves have been used in a strong tea to reduce fevers and loosen phlegm. Stems have been used to treat malaria [318-1].",
22,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Possibly used for erosion control due to the fibrous deep roots. Insectory: The nectar and pollen of the flowers attract their fair share of insects, including long-tongued bees, Halictine bees, bee flies, butterflies, Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus (Goldenrod Soldier Beetle), and other insects. Among the long-tongued bees, is the oligolege Holcopasites heliopsis (False Sunflower Bee). The caterpillars of Papaipoma rigida (Rigid Sunflower Borer Moth) sometimes bore through the stems[318-1].  Attracts birds and painted lady butterflies. Plant communities- Thickets Selected cultivars are shorter and attractive in a more formal garden. Smooth oxeye is considered one of the best hardy plants for a wildflower garden border [318-1].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An upright clumping perennial wildflower with sunflower-like heads. It performs well in dry (xeric) locations, in poor to average soils, and in full sun to partial shade. Flowering can be extended by removing spent flowers. Staking may be necessary in shady locations[318-1]. USDA Hardiness Zones: 3 - 9. Soil pH: 6.0 - 8.0. Growth Rate: Moderate. Life Span: Short-Lived Perennial. Stand Persistence: Long. Form: Upright. Texture: Coarse. Sun: Full Sun, Partial Shade. Soil Type: Loamy, Silty, Clay. Soil Moisture: Moderate, Dry. Minimum Root Depth: 12 inches. Root Type: Tap, Stolon. Fungal Types: Endomycorrhizal. Seasonal Interest: Summer. Fruit Type: Achene. Flower Color: Yellow. Drought: Tolerant. Flood: Moderate. Salt: Moderate. Soil Compaction: Moderate. Mowing: Tolerant. Fire Damage: Tolerant. Cold Injury: Infrequent. Wind Storm Damage: Infrequent. Disease Issues: Minor. Insect/Pest Damage: Minor. Animal Damage: Deer, Gophers, Mice, Rabbits. Growing Season: Warm. Bloom Time: Early Summer - Late Summer. Fruit Time: Summer - Fall [318-1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. Several cultivars are available with flowers of varying colors and shades. These include 'Summer Sun', 'Golden Plume', and 'Prairie Sunset'. The following cultivars of H. helianthoides var. scabra (""rough"") have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:'Benzinggold’,’Light of Loddon’,’Spitzentänzerin’,’Waterperry Gold’.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed, Cuttings, Division. Heliopsis helianthoides establishes readily from seed when planted in the winter/fall or early in spring (March to April). Germination generally starts four weeks after sowing if soil temperatures remain in the 60 – 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Seeds ripen approximately one month after flowering, however as with many Asters, plants are self sterile. It may be necessary to crack open a few seeds to make sure they are viable. Cuttings and Divisions: Five to seven node cuttings taken from the top 12 inches of growth in late spring root easily. Cuttings are sometimes reluctant to overwinter. Divide plants in the fall for best results [318-1].",
