It succeeds in clay soils and also in areas of higher rainfall, so long as the soil drains fairly well[203]. A very variable species with forms ranging in height from 8 - 50cm[203]. Closely related to A. carinatum[203]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].

Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division of the bulbs in late summer or the autumn. Larger bulbs can be planted straight out into their permanent positions, though it might be best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year before planting them out..",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
