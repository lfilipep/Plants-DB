Especially in the colder areas of the country this plant is best grown against a sunny south or south-west facing wall and given a good mulch of bracken in the winter[200]. The rootstock is fairly hardy in most of Britain, whilst the top growth tolerates temperatures down to about -10 to -15°c[200]. If cut back by severe weather the plant usually grows again from the base[200]. Flowers are produced on the current seasons growth[200]. Plants growing by the side of a greenhouse at Cambridge Botanical Gardens flower freely[11]. This species is closely related to H. myrtifolia, differing mainly in having larger flowers[11]. Any pruning is best carried out in early spring by removing excess growth at the base of the plant[200].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. Grow the young plants on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer. Mulch the roots well in the autumn to protect them from the cold.
