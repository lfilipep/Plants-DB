They are used in the treatment of a wide range of conditions including fevers and malaria; venereal diseases; coughs; stomach-ache, peptic ulcers, diarrhoea and worms[ 299 ]. An infusion of the aerial parts is taken as an anti-menstruation agent[ 299 ]. Externally, an infusion or decoction of the leaves is applied to various skin conditions including insect stings, itching skin, wounds and abscesses[ 299 ]. They are pounded in water and applied to ticks on humans and horses; and, mixed with palm oil, are rubbed on the head to kill lice[ 299 ]. An infusion of the aerial parts is added to a bath to treat haemorrhoids[ 299 ]. The root is anthelmintic, astringent, oxytocic and purgative[ 299 ]. Pounded with water, it is used as a treatment against diarrhoea, whilst an infusion or decoction is used to remove internal parasites and stimulate uterine contractions to remove a retained placenta and to promote labour[ 299 ]. The leaves contain the anthraquinone emodin[ 299 ]. Methanolic extracts have shown analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. They have also shown a protective action against ulcers, this may be via histaminergic receptor inhibition[ 299 ]. The extract also has a dose-dependent antidiarrhoeal activity[ 299 ]. The extract has also shown contraceptive activity through oestrogenic and anti-implantation activities[ 299 ]. Ethanolic plant extracts have shown antibacterial activity against Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus faecalis, and Vibrio cholerae[ 299 ]. Tests with plant extracts have shown significant action against Herpes simplex virus type 1 in vitro[ 299 ].","Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","Other uses rating: High (4/5). Other Uses: The dried leaves, leaf powder, ash and extracts have all been used as a protection from insects in the storage of pulses and cereals[ 299 ]. It has been shown that the powdered leaves are effective as a storage protectant for pulses, as they inhibit the hatching of insect larvae. They are not a health threat if removed before consumption[ 299 ].",,"The plant has a wide distribution in the tropics, being found in a wide range of habitats at elevations up to 1,200 metres. It grows well in areas with a mean annual rainfall in the range 950 - 1,400mm spread over 5 - 6 months, as in the Sudano-Guinean zone of West Africa[ 299 ]. The plant is especially common on heavy lateritic soils[ 299 ]. The plant is a spontaneous weed through much of the tropics and subtropics, and is sometimes found even in Australia[ 299 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 755 ].",Propagation Seed - germinates easily[ 299 ].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
