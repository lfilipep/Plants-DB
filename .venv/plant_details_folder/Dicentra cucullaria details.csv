It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.,,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,None known,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Tonic: Improves general health.

The dried tubers were used as a tonic and were recommended in the treatment of VD[213]. A tea made from the roots is diaphoretic and diuretic[222]. A poultice made from the leaves has been used in the treatment of skin ailments and as a muscle rub to make them more limber[222]. The plant contains an alkaloid that depresses the central nervous system - it is used in the treatment of paralysis and tremors[222].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Seashore, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a rich light soil[1], preferably neutral to slightly acid[200]. Prefers light shade and a sheltered position[175] but also succeeds in heavier shade[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. The seed is difficult to harvest, it ripens and falls from the plant very quickly[134]. The plant becomes dormant in the summer[188]. After fruit set, the bulblets of Dicentra cucullaria remain dormant until the autumn, when stored starch is converted to sugar. At this time also, flower buds and leaf primordia are produced below ground; these then remain dormant until spring[270]. This species is closely related to D. canadensis[270]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[134]. Stored seed should be sown in March[175]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[175]. Two weeks warm stratification at 18°c followed by six weeks at 2°c can shorten up the germination time[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring[200]. Best done when the plant is dormant in late winter[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings 7 - 10cm long in sandy soil in a cold frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
