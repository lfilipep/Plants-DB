22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Seashore, Woodland garden. Easily grown in a rich light soil[1], preferably neutral to slightly acid[200]. Prefers light shade and a sheltered position[175] but also succeeds in heavier shade[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. The seed is difficult to harvest, it ripens and falls from the plant very quickly[134]. The plant becomes dormant in the summer[188]. After fruit set, the bulblets of Dicentra cucullaria remain dormant until the autumn, when stored starch is converted to sugar. At this time also, flower buds and leaf primordia are produced below ground; these then remain dormant until spring[270]. This species is closely related to D. canadensis[270]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[134]. Stored seed should be sown in March[175]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[175]. Two weeks warm stratification at 18°c followed by six weeks at 2°c can shorten up the germination time[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring[200]. Best done when the plant is dormant in late winter[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Root cuttings 7 - 10cm long in sandy soil in a cold frame[200].",
