They are used to add flavour and body to a range of drinks including soda, ginger beer, root beer and root tonics[301 ]. This is a very agreeable bitter. It is used as a substitute for hops in ginger beer, and cool drinks[346 ]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Bitter  MouthwashA decoction of the root is used in Yucatan as a gargle for sores in the mouth and throat[331 ]. An infusion (of the stem?) has been employed in the treatment of gonorrhoea and dropsy, and as a light grateful bitter, in cases of debility, to restore the tone of the stomach[346 ]."
22,Other Uses,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The stems of this and other species probably contain saponin, and when they are chewed large quantities of lather are produced. The stems are often chewed to clean the teeth and harden the gums[46 , 331 ]. A piece of a branch, about as thick as the little finger, is softened by chewing, and then rubbed against the teeth. In this manner a tooth-brush, and, with it, a powder are obtained, equal, if not superior, to any in use in Europe[346 ]. When powdered, the stem forms an excellent dentifrice; its aromatic bitter producing a healthy state of the gums, and the mucilage it contains working up by the brush into a kind of soap-like froth[346 ]."
