24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Tolerates most soils[200], but prefers a good loamy soil, abundant moisture and full sunlight[11, 200]. This species is closely related to S. salicifolia and is often treated as no more than a variety of it[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if possible. It is likely to require stratification before it germinates, so stored seed should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as you receive it. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a light sandy soil a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15cm long, October/November in an outdoor frame[200]. Another report says that September is a good time to do this[11]. Division of suckers in early spring[200]. They can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
