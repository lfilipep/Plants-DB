Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Birthing aid  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Pectoral  Stimulant  Tonic  Uterine tonicGolden groundsel is a medicinal plant that is deserving of greater attention[4]. This species was widely used by N. American Indians to treat various complaints of the female reproductive system, and also to ease childbirth[238]. Whilst often stated to be completely safe to use, recent research has found that the plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that, in isolation, can cause liver damage and so this remedy can no longer be recommended for internal use[238, 254]. The roots and leaves are abortifacient, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, pectoral, stimulant and uterine tonic[4, 46, 165, 207, 222]. It is used externally in the treatment of vaginal discharge[238]. A tea made from the plant was frequently used by the N. American Indians as a remedy for various female troubles, including the pain of childbirth[207, 213]. Pharmacologists have not reported any uterine effects, but the plant does contain an essential oil (inuline) plus the alkaloids senecine and senecionine (which are poisonous to grazing animals)[213]. The plant is harvested before flowering and the roots are harvested in the autumn, both are dried for later use[238].",,None known,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in a sunny position in most moderately fertile well-drained soils[200]. Prefers a damp to wet soil and also succeeds in partial shade[238]. Succeeds in the wild garden though it is invasive[200]. This species is cultivated in parts of Russia for use in the pharmaceutical industry[238]. A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties[43]. Senecio aureus L. is a synonym of Packera aurea (L.)

The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter.
