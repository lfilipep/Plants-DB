18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The sweet tasting pulp found surrounding the seeds inside the pod is eaten[46 , 317 , 418 ]. It is not widely appreciated[416 ]. The nearly cylindrical, narrow pods are 10 - 20cm long, 1 - 2cm wide[418 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diuretic  LaxativeThe macerated bark is taken orally as a treatment for anaemia[418 ]. A decoction of the root is used as a treatment for gallstones[418 ]. The pulp of the fruit is a treatment for constipation[418 ]. It is reported to be astringent and diuretic[418 ].,
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Design: Shade tree; Street tree; Public open space. Agroforestry Uses:The tree fixes atmospheric nitrogen and so enriches the soil in which it grows. It is frequently used as a shade tree in coffee and cacao plantations, being large enough when only 3 years old[317, 418, 447].Inga species generally have a number of factors that make them popular for use as shade trees in coffee and cacao plantations:- they grow quickly and so soon make an effective shade; they respond well to drastic pruning and so are easy to keep within the required size and shade levels; they promote and maintain soil fertility; they are effective soil stabilizers[1309].Other Uses: The bark is a source of tannins[317]. It is used for dyeing textiles[317].The heartwood is pale brown to a golden brown, with longitudinal streaks or patches of darker brown often shaded with green or yellow; the sapwood is whitish. The wood is moderately heavy; moderately hard; strong; tough; of low durability, being very susceptible to attack by drywood termites and other insects and to decay in contact with the ground. Rate of air-seasoning is rapid, and amount of degrade is moderate. Machining characteristics are as follows: planing, turning, boring, mortising, sanding, and resistance to screw splitting are good; and shaping is poor. It is used for making posts and small implements such as boxes, toys, pencils etc[418, 419, 447].The wood makes an excellent fuel and is also used to make charcoal[303, 418, 447].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop  Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Minor Global CropA plant of the humid, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 28°c, but can tolerate 15 - 35°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,200 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in dappled shade[418 ]. Succeeds on a wide variety of soils, including limestone[303 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 8, tolerating 5.5 - 8.5[418 ]. A fast-growing tree[418 , 419 ]. The plant can flower and produce fruits throughout the year[303 , 418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position either in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A germination rate of around 100% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 3 - 5 days[419 ]. Transplant the seedbed seedlings to individual containers when they are 4 - 6cm tall. The seedlings develop quickly and should be ready to plant out 3 - 4 months later[419 ].",
