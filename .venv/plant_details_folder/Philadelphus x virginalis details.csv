Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.","The leaves are rich in saponins[169], when crushed and mixed with water they produce a lather that is an effective cleaner, used on the body, clothes etc. You can wash your hands by merely picking a couple of leaves or a bunch of blossom, wetting your hands and then rubbing the plant material vigorously as if it was a bar of soap[K]. This soap is a very gentle cleaner that does not remove the body's natural oils, but does remove dirt. It is not very effective against oil[K]. Plants can be grown as an informal hedge or screen[200]. The cultivar 'Burfordiensis' has been especially mentioned[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Specimen. Easily grown in any moderately fertile soil, succeeding in thin soils over chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates poor soils[200]. Succeeds in semi-shade but prefers a position in full sun where it will flower more freely[182, 200]. Grows well on the woodland edge or in a glade[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[200]. The flowers are powerfully scented[245]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning, one third of the stems can be cut down to the ground each year in order to promote fresh growth and heavier flowering[202]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best if given 1 months cold stratification[113]. Sow February in a light position in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This is a hybrid species and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long side-shoots, July/August in a shaded frame. Plant out in spring. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 15 - 25cm with a heel, December in a sheltered bed outdoors. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in summer.
