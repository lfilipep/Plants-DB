24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a well-drained sandy loam in a sunny sheltered position[200]. Tolerates poor soils[200]. Hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. Plants are almost hardy in Britain[1] and can be grown outdoors in the milder areas of the country[233]. They should be heavily mulched over the winter in areas where temperatures fall much below zero[200]. Transplants readily[157]. The flowering stems are easily damaged and flattened[157]. A very ornamental[233] and polymorphic species which could possibly be better treated as a complex of closely related species[193].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in the spring. Best done as the plants come into growth. Pot the divisions up and grow them on in a cold frame until they are established then plant them out in the summer.",
