24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained moisture retentive soil in full sun or light part day shade[11, 200]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at 5°c and should be sown as early as possible in the year[113]. Very little of the seed produced in Britain is viable[11]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Layering."
