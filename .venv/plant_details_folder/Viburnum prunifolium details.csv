18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 5, 55, 62, 200, 257]. A thin dry flesh with a sweet taste[11, 159, 227]. The fruit is somewhat variable in size and quality, the best forms are nice raw whilst others are used for making preserves etc[183]. The taste is best after a frost[22, 46, 61]. The ovoid fruit is about 17mm long and contains a single large seed[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Nervine: Stimulates and calms the nerves.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Birthing aid  Dysentery  Nervine  SedativeStagberry was used by the North American Indians to treat dysentery and to arrest haemorrhage of the uterus[254, 257]. It is now considered to be a specific treatment for the relief of menstrual pain - the bark contains 'scopoletin', a coumarin that has a sedative affect on the uterus and salicin, a painkiller that is used in making aspirin[238, 254]. The bark of the root and stems is abortifacient, anodyne, antispasmodic, astringent, nervine and sedative[9, 46, 165, 222]. A tea is used internally in the treatment of painful or heavy menstruation, prolapse of the uterus, morning sickness, to prevent miscarriage and to relieve spasms after childbirth[222, 238, 254]. It is also used to treat convulsive disorders, colic and other cramping pains that affect the bile ducts, hysteria, asthma and palpitations of a nervous origin[238, 254]. The stem bark is harvested in the autumn before the leaves change colour, or in the spring before the leaf buds open[238]. The root bark is only harvested in the autumn[254]. Both barks can be dried for later use[238]."
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as a hedge, they can be sheared to make a formal screen[200].  - heavy, hard, strong, brittle, close grained[82]. It weighs 52lb per cubic foot, but is of no commercial importance due to the small size of the trees[227, 229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Screen, Specimen. An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils[1]. Unlike other members of the genus, this species grows well on poor soils and in dry situations[200]. Prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -40°c[200]. Plants are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78]."
