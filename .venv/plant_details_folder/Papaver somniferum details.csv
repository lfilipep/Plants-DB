0,Papaver somniferum,Opium Poppy,Papaveraceae,Coming soon,"This plant contains a number of very toxic compounds, many of which are extracted and used as pain killers etc in medicine. They are also used to make various highly addictive narcotic drugs[7, 10, 19, 65]. However, in the cooler climate of Britain these compounds are not formed in sufficient quantity to make their extraction worthwhile. There are no toxins in the seeds[10, 46, 65].",Not known in a truly wild situation.,"Europe to Asia, though the original habitat is obscure. A rare casual in Britain.",(4 of 5),(2 of 5),Yes,(4 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PapaverSomniferum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PapaverSomniferum2.jpg",,"Papaver somniferum is a ANNUAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[2, 14, 15]. Much used as a flavouring in cakes, bread, fruit salads etc[183], it imparts a very nice nutty flavour[K]. The crushed and sweetened seeds are used as a filling in crepes, strudels, pastries etc[183]. Highly nutritious, the seed contains about 22.7% protein, 48% fat, 9.8% carbohydrate, 7.1% ash[179]. It is also a good source of lecithin[269]. The seeds are rather small, but there are large numbers of them contained in capsules 3cm or more in diameter and so they are easy to harvest and utilize[K]. The seeds are perfectly safe to eat, containing very little if any of the narcotic principles[10, 65, 238]. However, although the seeds contain no narcotic alkaloids, analysis of the urine following their ingestion may produce similar results to the analysis of the urine of morphine or heroin addicts[269]. Edible young leaves - raw or cooked[183]. They must be used before the flower buds have formed[179]. In some countries they are eaten at the seedling stage[269]. One report says that the leaves do not contain any narcotic principles[179]. Some caution is advised, see notes at top of the page. A high quality edible drying oil is obtained from the seed. It has an almond flavour[238] and makes a good substitute for olive oil[21, 46, 57, 89, 183].","Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Homeopathy: A plant used in homeopathic treatments.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Antitussive  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Dysentery  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Homeopathy  Hypnotic  Narcotic  SedativeThe opium poppy contains a wide range of alkaloids and has been a very valuable medicine, especially useful in bringing relief from pain. Its use (especially of the extracted alkaloids opium and morphine which it contains) can become addictive, however, and so it should be treated with extreme caution and only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[244]. The dried juice (latex) from the unripe green seed vessels is a rich source of the active alkaloids, including morphine[232, 240]. It is extracted by making shallow incisions in the capsules as soon as the petals have fallen[4]. Care must be taken that the incisions do not penetrate to the interior of the seed capsules[4]. The latex exudes from the capsules and dries in contact with the air - it is then scraped off[4]. This latex is anodyne, antitussive, astringent, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, hypnotic, narcotic and sedative[4, 7, 13, 176, 192, 218]. As well as its pain-relieving properties, the latex has also been used as an antispasmodic and expectorant in treating certain kinds of coughs, whilst its astringent properties make it useful in the treatment of dysentery etc[4]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the dried latex[232]. This is used in the treatment of a variety of complaints, including constipation, fevers and insomnia[232].","Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The seed yields 44 - 50% of an edible drying oil[61]. Very good for lighting, it burns for longer than most oils[115]. The oil is also used in paints, soap making etc[46, 57].",,"Prefers a rich well-drained sandy loam in a sunny position[4, 200]. Requires a moist soil[14] but does not do well on wet clays[115]. Prefers a sandy loam or a chalky soil[115]. Plants often self-sow in British gardens. The opium poppy is a very ornamental plant that is often cultivated in the flower garden[1]. There are many named varieties, some of which have been developed for their edible uses[183]. The plant is widely grown, often illegally, in warm temperate and tropical climates for the substances contained in its sap. These are often used medicinally as pain killers, especially in the treatment of terminally ill patients suffering extreme pain, they are also used for their narcotic effects by some people. These substances are highly addictive and lead to a shortening of the life span if used with any frequency. In cool temperate zones the plant does not produce sufficient of the narcotic principles to make their extraction feasible[4] and cultivation of the plant is perfectly legal in Britain[K]. Plants have ripened their seeds as far north as latitude 69°n in Norway[141]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].",Seed - sow spring or autumn in situ[200].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
