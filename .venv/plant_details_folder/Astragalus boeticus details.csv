0,Astragalus boeticus,Swedish Coffee,Fabaceae or Leguminosae,7-10,Many members of this genus contain toxic glycosides[65]. All species with edible seedpods can be distinguished by their fleshy round or oval seedpod that looks somewhat like a greengage.[85] A number of species can also accumulate toxic levels of selenium when grown in soils that are relatively rich in that element[65].,Sandy places and arable fields[50].,S.W. Europe - Spain.,(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Well drained soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AstragalusBoeticus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AstragalusBoeticus2.jpg",,"Astragalus boeticus is a ANNUAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"Young seedpods are edible[177]. The roasted seed is used as a coffee substitute[1, 62, 183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a dry well-drained soil in a sunny position[1]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Cultivated in some parts of N. Europe for its seed which is used as a coffee substitute[61, 183]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance and are best planted in their final positions whilst still small[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen. Many members of this genus can be difficult to grow, this may partly be due to a lack of their specific bacterial associations in the soil[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate[200]. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed[134, 200]. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours[134, 200]. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh[134]. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
