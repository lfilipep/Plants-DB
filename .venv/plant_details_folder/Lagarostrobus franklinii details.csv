Tasmania.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LagarostrobusFranklinii.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LagarostrobusFranklinii2.jpg",,"Lagarostrobus franklinii is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Dacrydium franklinii. Hook.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Dappled Shade;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","The source of an essential oil, called Huon pinewood oil, that has been recommended for the production of vanillin[61, 183]. This can be used as a flavouring in ice creams, confectionery, beverages etc[183]. It is usually obtained by steam distillation of the wood[156].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,","The essential oil (see above) is also used in medicinal soaps, toilet water, as a preservative in casein paints etc[46, 61, 156]. Wood - fairly hard, straight grained, light, soft, strong, aromatic. It is very durable, containing a strongly scented resin that repels insects. Used for construction, furniture etc[61, 156, 167].",,"Requires a light, freely draining soil[164] in a sheltered position with protection from cold winds[166]. Requires high rainfall and humidity if it is to succeed[200]. This species tolerates shade and probably requires it in drier areas if the tree is to survive[82, 200]. It requires warm summers if it is to grow well in this country, and even then it is very slow growing[11, 200]. Plants are only hardy in the milder areas of the country[11, 82]. An 80 year old tree at Bodnant was 6 metres tall in 1970[185]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and colder, wetter winters.",Seed - sow spring in a freely draining compost. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Another report says that the seed can be very slow to germinate and that it is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
