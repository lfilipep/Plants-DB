17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"The source of an essential oil, called Huon pinewood oil, that has been recommended for the production of vanillin[61, 183]. This can be used as a flavouring in ice creams, confectionery, beverages etc[183]. It is usually obtained by steam distillation of the wood[156].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,",
23,Other Uses Description,"The essential oil (see above) is also used in medicinal soaps, toilet water, as a preservative in casein paints etc[46, 61, 156]. Wood - fairly hard, straight grained, light, soft, strong, aromatic. It is very durable, containing a strongly scented resin that repels insects. Used for construction, furniture etc[61, 156, 167].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a light, freely draining soil[164] in a sheltered position with protection from cold winds[166]. Requires high rainfall and humidity if it is to succeed[200]. This species tolerates shade and probably requires it in drier areas if the tree is to survive[82, 200]. It requires warm summers if it is to grow well in this country, and even then it is very slow growing[11, 200]. Plants are only hardy in the milder areas of the country[11, 82]. An 80 year old tree at Bodnant was 6 metres tall in 1970[185]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and colder, wetter winters.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a freely draining compost. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 20°c[164]. Another report says that the seed can be very slow to germinate and that it is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible.,
