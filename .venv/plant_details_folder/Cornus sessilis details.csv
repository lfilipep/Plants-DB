18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The following note is for the closely related C. officinalis. It can probably also be applied to this species[K]. The fruit of this species is about 1 - 1.5cm long[200]:- Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. The fully ripe fruit is quite pleasant but slightly astringent[K]. It is about 1.5cm long[200]. The fruit contains about 8.6% sugars, 2.9% malic acid, 0.74% ash[179].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. This species is very closely related to C. mas and C. officinalis[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",
