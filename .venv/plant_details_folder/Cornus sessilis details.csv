See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,Fruit: ,,"The following note is for the closely related C. officinalis. It can probably also be applied to this species[K]. The fruit of this species is about 1 - 1.5cm long[200]:- Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. The fully ripe fruit is quite pleasant but slightly astringent[K]. It is about 1.5cm long[200]. The fruit contains about 8.6% sugars, 2.9% malic acid, 0.74% ash[179].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. This species is very closely related to C. mas and C. officinalis[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
