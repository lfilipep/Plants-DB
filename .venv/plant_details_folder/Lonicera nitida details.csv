22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Hedge. A very easily grown and tolerant plant, it succeeds in any fertile soil, preferring a good moist soil in a sunny position[11, 200]. Succeeds in deep shade[202]. Established plants are fairly drought tolerant, so long as there is plenty of humus in the soil[190]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184, 202]. Another report says that it is not very hardy in northern Britain and that it rarely fruits in Britain[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of deer[182]. A number of forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can regrow from very old wood[202]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn[200]."
