24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. This plant has potential as a perennial cereal. The seed is small but can be harvested 2 - 3 times a year if the plants are well grown and fertilized[183]. It is considered to be a part of B. carinatus by some botanists[60]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in a sunny position in most well-drained soils[138, 200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in situ and only just cover. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If seed is in short supply it can be surface sown in a cold frame in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. Division in spring. Large clumps can be planted out direct into their permanent positions whilst it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are ready to be planted out."
