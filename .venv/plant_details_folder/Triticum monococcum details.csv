19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[46, 50, 57, 61]. It is usually ground into a flour and used as a cereal[183]. It is not very suitable for bread making[74] (this probably means that it is low in gluten). Retains its glumes when threshed making utilization of the seed more difficult[74, 105].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Starch: Used as a fabric stiffener.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The straw has many uses, as a biomass for fuel etc, for thatching, as a mulch in the garden etc[141]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in late summer after the seed has been harvested, they are cut into usable pieces and soaked in clear water for 24 hours. They are then cooked for 2 hours in lye or soda ash and then beaten in a ball mill for 1½ hours in a ball mill. The fibres make a green-tan paper[189]. The starch from the seed is used for laundering, sizing textiles etc[46, 61]. It can also be converted to alcohol for use as a fuel.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position. A low yielding species[57], but it succeeds in poor rocky soils[57, 171] and thrives in a short growing season[160]. This is supposedly the oldest species of wheat, it probably arose over 10,000 years ago and is still occasionally cultivated for its edible seed in the mountains of Germany, Switzerland and Italy[50, 61, 183]. A diploid species[142].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring or autumn in situ and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within a few days[K].,
