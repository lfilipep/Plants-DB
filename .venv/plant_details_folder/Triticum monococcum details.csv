Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - cooked[46, 50, 57, 61]. It is usually ground into a flour and used as a cereal[183]. It is not very suitable for bread making[74] (this probably means that it is low in gluten). Retains its glumes when threshed making utilization of the seed more difficult[74, 105].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in late summer after the seed has been harvested, they are cut into usable pieces and soaked in clear water for 24 hours. They are then cooked for 2 hours in lye or soda ash and then beaten in a ball mill for 1½ hours in a ball mill. The fibres make a green-tan paper[189]. The starch from the seed is used for laundering, sizing textiles etc[46, 61]. It can also be converted to alcohol for use as a fuel.",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position. A low yielding species[57], but it succeeds in poor rocky soils[57, 171] and thrives in a short growing season[160]. This is supposedly the oldest species of wheat, it probably arose over 10,000 years ago and is still occasionally cultivated for its edible seed in the mountains of Germany, Switzerland and Italy[50, 61, 183].
