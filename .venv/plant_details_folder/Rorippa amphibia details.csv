Plants grow in boggy soils or in shallow water, the submerged forms have finely divided bright green leaves[200]. Plants seem to be extremely attractive to slugs. They can eat out all the new growth in spring and kill even large plants[K].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Make sure the pots are not allowed to dry out. Division in spring. Very easy, but protect the young divisions from slugs. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings succeed at almost any time in the growing season. Very easy, even a floating leaf will form adventitious roots[56].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
