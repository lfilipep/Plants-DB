The seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",

22,Other Uses,"Cork: Including any plants used as a cork substitute. Cork is used for insulation (sound or heat), fire-retardant, bottle stops etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow dye is obtained from the unthickened bark[46, 61]. The bark is a cork substitute. It is used to make buoys, floats etc[61]. The bark of this tree is not corky[11, 200].  - heavy, hard, strong, close grained. Used for furniture, the interior finish of buildings, utensils etc[46, 61]. An oil obtained from the seed has insecticidal properties similar to pyrethrum[57]. (This use is for the closely related P. amurense. It might also apply to this tree[K].)",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moisture retentive well-drained deep rich loam in full sun[11, 200]. Grows best in areas with long hot summers[200]. Plants are gross feeders and require a rich soil if they are to perform well[11]. Dormant plants are very hardy, but the young growth is liable to damage from late spring frosts[11, 200]. This species is closely related to P. amurense, differing in its non-corky bark[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification, sow in late winter in a cold frame[78, 113]. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in autumn and over winter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Root cuttings - obtain in December and store in leafmold in a warm place for 3 weeks. Cut into 4cm lengths and plant horizontally in pots. Grow on in a warm greenhouse. Good percentage[78].",
