24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame in early spring. Only just cover the seed and make sure that the compost does not dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
