17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a warm sheltered position in a well-drained soil that is not too dry[11, 138, 200]. Plants are likely to rot if the soil remains too wet in winter[200]. Succeeds on chalk[11, 182]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants are often cut to the ground in severe winters but they usually regrow from the base[11, 182]. It is best to give the roots a mulch in the winter[11]. A very ornamental but short-lived plant[1]. The leaves are very aromatic[188].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse in the autumn[188]. Sow stored seed in February to May in a greenhouse[138]. Only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].",
