If the plant is cut down after flowering, it will normally produce another flush of flowers[233]. A very ornamental plant[233], it grows well in open woodland[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[1, 200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible. Protect from direct sunlight[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division, with care, in early spring or autumn[200]."
