Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidepressant  Antiemetic  Antiinflammatory  Antitussive  Aphrodisiac  Appetizer  Carminative  Digestive  Diuretic  Expectorant  Laxative  Malaria  Parasiticide  Purgative  Restorative  Stomachic  Tonic  UrinaryThe plant is widely used medicinally throughout its range, the root especially being valued. Relatively little research on the active compounds in the plant has been effected. The roots contain 1 - 1.2% of an essential oil, 2.8% of a fixed oil, 20% glucose, 0.7% resin and 0.045% of a glycoside[299 ]. The essential oil causes inflammation and reddening of the skin, irritation of the mucous membranes and relaxes mammalian intestinal smooth muscles[299 ]. Hexane, methanol and water extracts of the leaves and roots did not show any antibacterial activity against a range of human pathogens. The hexane and methanol extracts showed significant anti-inflammatory activity[299 ]. An aqueous root extract showed moderate activity against Schistosoma haematobium[299 ]. An aqueous root bark extract at 400 mg/kg/day given orally during 8 days increased testosterone production and fertility of male rats[299 ] An aqueous root extract administered to human spermatozoa in vitro was found to enhance total motility as well as progressive motility in a time-dependent manner[299 ]. Both the roots and the root bark have a pronounced vanilla-like odour and taste like a mixture of liquorice and ginger[299 ].They are anodyne, aphrodisiac, appetizer, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, purgative, restorative, stomachic, tonic and uterine stimulant[299 ]. The root is especially highly valued throughout Africa as an aphrodisiac - the fresh or dried roots are chewed to treat sexual weakness, prevent premature ejaculation and to increase sperm production[299 ]. A decoction or infusion is widely taken to treat digestive troubles including gastro-intestinal problems, stomach-ache, indigestion, constipation, anorexia, and as a restorative and appetite stimulant[299 ]. The decoction is also used to treat a wide range of other conditions, including urinary infections, gonorrhoea, jaundice, coughs, bronchitis, chest complaints, headache, paralysis and epileptic attacks, depression, to relieve body pains and to treat fits in children[299 ]. The root is pulverized and added to porridge in order to treat schistosomiasis[299 ]. A plant extract is taken to treat malaria[299 ]. The leaves are squeezed in water and the filtrate is drunk to stop heavy post partum bleeding[299 ].T A leaf decoction is drunk to stop vomiting[299 ]."
