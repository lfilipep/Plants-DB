The dried powdered leaves are added to food as a condiment[299 ]. The vanilla-like odour may have potential as a novel African fragrance or spice[299 ]. The fruits are considered edible in some parts of Africa, although in southern Africa the seeds are used as an arrow poison[299 ]. The roots are used to flavour food and tea[299 ].

Relatively little research on the active compounds in the plant has been effected. The roots contain 1 - 1.2% of an essential oil, 2.8% of a fixed oil, 20% glucose, 0.7% resin and 0.045% of a glycoside[299 ]. The essential oil causes inflammation and reddening of the skin, irritation of the mucous membranes and relaxes mammalian intestinal smooth muscles[299 ]. Hexane, methanol and water extracts of the leaves and roots did not show any antibacterial activity against a range of human pathogens. The hexane and methanol extracts showed significant anti-inflammatory activity[299 ]. An aqueous root extract showed moderate activity against Schistosoma haematobium[299 ]. An aqueous root bark extract at 400 mg/kg/day given orally during 8 days increased testosterone production and fertility of male rats[299 ] An aqueous root extract administered to human spermatozoa in vitro was found to enhance total motility as well as progressive motility in a time-dependent manner[299 ]. Both the roots and the root bark have a pronounced vanilla-like odour and taste like a mixture of liquorice and ginger[299 ].They are anodyne, aphrodisiac, appetizer, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, purgative, restorative, stomachic, tonic and uterine stimulant[299 ]. The root is especially highly valued throughout Africa as an aphrodisiac - the fresh or dried roots are chewed to treat sexual weakness, prevent premature ejaculation and to increase sperm production[299 ]. A decoction or infusion is widely taken to treat digestive troubles including gastro-intestinal problems, stomach-ache, indigestion, constipation, anorexia, and as a restorative and appetite stimulant[299 ].
