Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - stratification is not necessary but can lead to more regular germination[113]. The seed is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[138]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. It usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c but stored seed can take longer[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of short side shoots with a heel, September in a frame[200]. High percentage[78]. Rather slow to root[K]. Nodal cuttings in spring in a frame. Fairly easy[200].",
