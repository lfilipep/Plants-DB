4,Known Hazards,"Although no reports have been seen for this species, the dried leaves of some members of this genus can be toxic though the fresh leaves are quite safe[76]. (This is possibly due to the presence of coumarin, the substance that gives some dried plants the smell of new mown hay. If taken internally it can prevent the blood from clotting.)",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this plant and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. It is, perhaps, no more than a synonym of Medicago officinalis[266]. Dislikes shade. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in situ[87]. Pre-soaking the seed for 12 hours in warm water will speed up the germination process, particularly in dry weather[K]. Germination will usually take place within 2 weeks.",
