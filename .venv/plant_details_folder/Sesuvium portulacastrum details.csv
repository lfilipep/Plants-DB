18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living trellis: Plants to physically support other crops.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."

23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover to prevent erosion in dune vegetation[299, 398]. A pioneer sand-colonising plant that grows on the upper beach and seaward slope of the frontal dune or beach ridge. It traps and holds wind-blown sand and tends to form small ridges or mounds. It does not survive complete burial under wind-blown sand. It also grows well in more protected littoral locations, and it can be included in dune revegetation programmes[299]. Pollution control:potential for phytoremediation in heavy metal polluted sites. Ornamental groundcover. Revegetator for salty areas in the United Arab Emirates."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Sea purslane is a suberect, prostrate or creeping, succulent, perennial herb growing up to 30cm tall[299]. The thick stems form roots at the nodes[299]. Prefers a sunny position in well-drained sandy soil[299]. The plant tolerates acidic and alkaline soils[299]. Very tolerant of salty conditions[299]. Established plants are very drought-tolerant [299]. A low-maintenance plant, it needs no irrigation or fertilizer and serious diseases or pests are not known[299].Plants can become troublesome weeds in rice fields[398].Plants flower and fruit all year round[299]. Each flower opens for only a few hours per day[299]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed. Rooted stem cuttings.
