19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw, cooked or ground into a powder[1, 2, 81, 157, 183]. Starchy and delicious, it has the texture of a waxy boiled potato with the flavour of chestnuts[183]. Large, it is an important food source for the Australian Aborigines[156]. Cones can be up to 4.5 kilos in weight and contain up to 150 seeds[1]. The germinating seed produces an underground 'earth nut' which has a coconut-like flavour[183].",

22,Other Uses,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.,
23,Other Uses Description,"- soft, easily worked, high quality. Used for cabinet making, flooring, plywood etc[156]. The branches are used for fencing and fuel[272].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbLandscape Uses:Container, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils[157]. Plants are resistant to salt spray[157]. Not very hardy outdoors in Britain, it requires a cool greenhouse in most parts of the country[1]. Some provenances should be hardy at least in the milder areas, there is one tree growing in Cornwall at Glendurgan gardens[81]. It was 10 metres tall in 1965[185]. This species is hardy to about -5°c, with occasional lows to -8°c, but it is liable to be killed in severe winters even in the Scilly Isles[200]. In Australia, each Aboriginal family would own a group of trees and these would be passed down from generation to generation[2]. This is said to be the only case of hereditary personal property owned by the Aborigines[2]. Special features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[134] or it can be stored cool and moist then sown February in a greenhouse[78, 80]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 15°c[134]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The plants have a rather sparse root system and are best placed in their final positions as soon as possible. Give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter[K].",
