Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbLandscape Uses:Container, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils[157]. Plants are resistant to salt spray[157]. Not very hardy outdoors in Britain, it requires a cool greenhouse in most parts of the country[1]. Some provenances should be hardy at least in the milder areas, there is one tree growing in Cornwall at Glendurgan gardens[81]. It was 10 metres tall in 1965[185]. This species is hardy to about -5°c, with occasional lows to -8°c, but it is liable to be killed in severe winters even in the Scilly Isles[200]. In Australia, each Aboriginal family would own a group of trees and these would be passed down from generation to generation[2]. This is said to be the only case of hereditary personal property owned by the Aborigines[2].

The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 15°c[134]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The plants have a rather sparse root system and are best placed in their final positions as soon as possible. Give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
