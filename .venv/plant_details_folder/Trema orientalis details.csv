13,Summary,"Trema orientalis, also known for various common names such as Charcoal Tree, African Elm, Tree Peach, ands Woolly Cedar, is a tropical flowering tree growing about 10 m in height and 20 cm in trunk diameter. It is commonly found in East Asia. It is very fast-growing and has an extensive root system that enables it to survive drought conditions. The leaves are heart-shaped, rough, hairy when young, and have fine teeth along the edges. The flowers are small and green occurring in short dense bunches. Fruits are small, black, and round. Medicinally, the plant is used for coughs, sore throat, asthma, bronchitis, gonorrhea, yellow fever, toothache, poisons, and dysentery. The leaves and fruits are edible. Charcoal tree is mainly used in agroforestry. It is planted as a shade tree in plantations, and used as a pioneer species and for soil reclamation and conservation. Fiber obtained from the bark is used for making cords and ropes. The bark also yields black and brown dye. The leaves and bark contain saponin and tannin. The wood is soft and not durable, hence used in manufacturing panel products, panel and drumsticks, for paper and pulp production, and as firewood and for charcoal production."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Trema orientalis is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:  tree has a wide range of applications in agroforestry. It is often planted as a shade tree in coffee and cocoa plantations and also in other crops in Asia and Africa[303 ]. A common pioneer species, it is among the first trees to establish in clearings, on flood-damaged riverbanks, and also colonizes denuded poor soils[303 ]. The tree regenerates profusely through its numerous seeds and grows rapidly, so it is a common colonizer of disturbed rainforest areas[303 ]. It is widely planted for soil reclamation in southern Asia[200 ]. It grows rapidly on disturbed soil so helps in soil conservation[303 ]. The mulch is used to improve the soil. The tree is common as a fallow species in shifting cultivation[303 ].  tree can serve as reservoirs for populations of defoliating insect pests and thus may put at risk nearby plants of economic value[418 ] Other Uses A fibre obtained from the bark is used for making cords and ropes[46 , 272 , 303 ]. The seed contains a dark green fixed oil[303 ]. The bark yields a black dye[303 ]. A brown dye is obtained from the bark[46 ]. The inner bark is rubbed on ropes to blacken and preserve them[303 ]. A coffee-coloured dye is obtained from the leaves[303 ]. The bark and leaves contain a saponin and tannin[303 ]. The wood is off-white or tinged with pink. It is fine-grained, soft, light and of low durability. It is used in manufacturing panel products, poles and drumsticks[303 ]. An appropriate tropical hardwood for paper and pulp production.  made from T. Orientalis has good tensile strength and folding endurance[303 ]. The tree can provide plenty of firewood and excellent charcoal which is even suitable for making gunpowder and fireworks[272 , 303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropCharcoal tree is a plant of the lowland humid tropics, where it can be found at elevations from sea level up to 2,500 metres[303 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 15 - 27°c, but can tolerate 8 - 34°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Requires a well-drained, sandy soil[266 , 303 ]. Succeeds on a wide range of soils from heavy clay to light sand; tolerating moderate alkalinity and salinity[303 ]. The plant has an extensive root system, which enables it to withstand dry periods[303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7.5[418 ]. A very fast growing tree, attaining a harvestable size for pulpwood in 3 - 4 years[303 ]. It coppices well[303 ]. The tree has an extensive root system that enables it to survive long periods of drought[303 ]. The species is intolerant of fire[303 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - to break dormancy, the seed needs to be stored at 2?c for 3 - 4 months[303 ]. Seeds require a high light intensity for germination. Germination rate is around 30%[303 ]. Seed storage behaviour is uncertain; viability can be maintained for 6 months in hermetic storage at room temperature, after which viability reduces rapidly[303 ]. Cuttings."
