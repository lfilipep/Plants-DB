22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,We have virtually no information on this plant and are not sure if it will be hardy in Britain. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus[K]. Grows well in a moderately good light soil[200].Tolerates poor soils[200]. Plants are prone to rot overwinter in wet soils[200]. A good bee plant. Rodents are very fond of the tubers so the plants may require some protection[200].
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in the year in a greenhouse. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. Division in spring[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings taken in spring as growth commences. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer."
