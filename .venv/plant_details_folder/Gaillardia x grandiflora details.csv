It prefers full sun, sandy, Loamy or Silty soil, and moderate to dry soil moisture. Soil pH: 5.5 - 7.9. Gaillardia × grandiflora is drought tolerant but prefers a moist well-drained soil. Performs poorly in unamended heavy clay soils [368-1]. Gaillardia × grandiflora is a tetraploid hybrid resulting from a cross between a 3’ tall perennial gaillardia (G. aristata) and a 2’ tall annual gaillardia (G. pulchella). It arguably inherited its perennial habit from the former and its long flowering period and rapid growth rate from the latter [368-1]. Flower Color: Orange, Red, Rust, or Yellow. Blooms late spring to fall. Heat zones 1 -8. Plants are so prolific and long blooming that they often exhaust themselves and are then short-lived[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Several cultivars exist, among them 'Arizona sun' and 'Arizona red shades'. Minimum Root Depth: 16 inches.  In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a 'clumping' habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].","Seed, basal cuttings, or division.
