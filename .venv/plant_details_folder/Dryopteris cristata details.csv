0,Dryopteris cristata,Crested Wood Fern,Dryopteridaceae,4-8,"Although we have found no reports for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. The fresh plant contains thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]. However, there have been reports for other species of ferns suggesting that even cooked fronds can have a long term harmful effect. Some caution is therefore advised.","Damp woods[222].

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,"Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diaphoretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  VermifugeThe male fern is one of the most popular and effective treatments for tape worms. The root stalks are anodyne, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, astringent, expectorant, febrifuge, sudorific, vermifuge and vulnerary[218, 222, 238]. The root contains 'filicin’, a substance that paralyses tapeworms and other internal parasites and has been used as a worm expellent[238]. It is one of the most effective treatments known for tapeworms - its use should be immediately followed by a non-oily purgative such as magnesium sulphate in order to expel the worms from the body[238]. An oily purge, such as caster oil, increases the absorption of the fern root and can be dangerous[238]. The root is also taken internally in the treatment of internal haemorrhage, uterine bleeding, mumps and feverish illnesses[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and can be dried for later use, it should not be stored for longer than 12 months[238]. This remedy should be used with caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The root is toxic and the dosage is critical[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Externally, the root is used in the treatment of abscesses, boils, carbuncles and sores[238].",,None known,,"Prefers an acid to neutral soil, succeeding in ordinary fertile soil in a shady position. Succeeds in full sun but grows best in a shady position with only 2 - 3 hours sun per day[200]. Tolerates a pH range from 4.5 to 7[200]. Dislikes heavy clay. Prefers a good supply of water at its roots but succeeds in dry shade and tolerates drought when it is established. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Hybridizes in the wild with several other species[187].","Spores - can be sown at any time of the year in a greenhouse. Surface sow on a sterilised compost and keep moist, possibly by placing the pot in a plastic bag. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20°c. Pot up small clumps of the plants when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a shady part of the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Division in spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
