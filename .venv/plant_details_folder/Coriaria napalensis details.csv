24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fairly good loamy soil in a sheltered position in full sun or light shade[11, 164, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. According to one report plants succeed at Kew but are frequently cut to the ground in severe winters though they resprout from the base[11, 200]. This new growth does not flower in its first year[182]. However, a medium-size tree seen at Kew in 1990 seemed to have survived many winters without untoward damage[K]. The roots of plants in this genus bear nitrogen-fixing nodules[218]. Whilst much of the nitrogen will be utilized by the growing plant, some of it will become available for other plants growing nearby[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in a greenhouse[78]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair percentage[78]."
