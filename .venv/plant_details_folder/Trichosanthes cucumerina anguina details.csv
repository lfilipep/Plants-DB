25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich well-drained soil and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1]. Cultivated in India for its edible fruit it is not hardy in Britain, requiring greenhouse cultivation[200], though it may be possible to grow it as an annual in a very warm sheltered bed outdoors[1]. The plant is very variable in the shape of the fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. Plants grow best with short daylengths and stable temperatures above 25°c[200]. Plants climb by means of tendrils[188] and also have a slightly twining stem[219]. A weight is sometimes attached to the growing fruit to ensure that it grows straight[183]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in pots in a warm greenhouse in a rich soil. Sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot and thin to the strongest plant. Grow them on fast and plant out after the last expected frosts. Give them some protection, such as a frame or cloche, until the plants are growing away well."
