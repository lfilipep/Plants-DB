Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.","Juglans hindsii is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw[105, 117, 257].

America as a vigorous disease-resistant and drought tolerant rootstock for J. regia[117, 183, 229]. A black dye is obtained from the seed husks[257]. Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots of many members of this genus produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200].  - heavy, hard, rather coarse grained[82]. A valuable timber, the tree is occasionally cultivated for its wood[229].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Requires a deep well-drained loam and a sunny position sheltered from strong winds[1, 11]. Prefers a slightly alkaline soil[200]. The plant's deep taproot gives the tree some degree of drought tolerance[229]. Plants are hardy at Kew[11], though they do not succeed in the colder areas of the country[200]. This species is occasionally cultivated for its edible seed[117]. There are also some named forms that have been selected for their use as a rootstock[183]. Plants produce a deep taproot and they are intolerant of root disturbance[1, 11]. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection for their first winter or two since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11]. Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer[200]. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2°c, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf[200]. Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree[200]. Trees have a dense canopy which tends to reduce plant growth below them. We have no specific information for this species, but the roots of several members of this genus produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200]. The leaves of many species also secrete substances that have an inhibitory affect on plants growing underneath them. All in all this is not a very good companion plant[K]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual deep pots in a cold frame[80]. You need to protect it from mice, birds, squirrels etc. The seed usually germinates in late winter or the spring. Plant out the seedlings into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two. The seed can also be stored in cool moist conditions (such s the salad compartment of a fridge) over the winter and sown in early spring but it may then require a period of cold stratification before it will germinate[78, 80].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
