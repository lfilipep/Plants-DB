See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Tussilago alba.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Ground Cover; Meadow;,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,,The small fleshy petioles (leaf stems) are very palatable when cooked and eaten like asparagus[7].,"Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antitussive  Emmenagogue  Homeopathy  Hypnotic  Sedative  VulneraryThe root is emmenagogue, hypnotic, sedative and vulnerary[7, 172]. The ground or finely chopped rhizome has a healing effect when applied to slow-healing or weak ulcers, or to suppurating wounds[7]. An infusion of the leaves is a specific remedy for coughs[7]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[7]. It is used in the treatment of wounds, ulcers etc[7].",,A good ground cover for the wilder areas of the garden[200]. It is too invasive to be used in small gardens and is only suitable for covering large areas[208]. The leaves were at one time used by peasants as a head covering[7].,,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1], but prefers a deep fertile humus-rich soil that is permanently moist but not stagnant, succeeding in shade, semi-shade or full sun[200]. Prefers partial shade[31]. Prefers a heavy soil[208]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A very invasive plant, too rampant for anything other than the wild garden[187, 200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe or in early spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division succeeds at almost any time of the year. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
