Succeeds in dry soils, tolerating drought once it is established[190]. Grows well between stepping stones on paths, tolerating light treading[183, 200]. Succeeds on walls. Thymes dislike wet conditions, especially in the winter. A layer of gravel on the soil around them will help protect the foliage from wet soils[238]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. The leaves of the species have a delicious caraway scent[190]. There are some named varieties. 'Nutmeg' is fast growing and has a pronounced fragrance somewhat reminiscent of nutmeg[183]. 'Lemon Scented' has a strong lemon scent[200]. The flowers are rich in nectar and are very attractive to honey bees[200].

Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Flower characteristics are unknown.","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Seed can also be sown in autumn in a greenhouse. Surface sow or barely cover the seed. Germination can be erratic. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring. Cuttings of young shoots, 5 - 8cm with a heel, May/June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200].
