22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a light sandy, peaty or humus-rich woodland soil and a rather shady situation[1, 130, 280]. Suitable for a choice position in a cool leafy soil[187]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. A slow-growing plant[188]. Plants have an extensive root system and resent disturbance[188]. They should be pot-grown and planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible. Special Features:North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 5. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed as soon as possible in late winter or the spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring[200]."
