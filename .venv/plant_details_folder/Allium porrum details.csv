0,Allium porrum,"Leek, Garden leek",Alliaceae,5-9,"Although no individual reports regarding this species have been seen, there have been cases of poisoning caused by the consumption, in large quantities and by some mammals, of certain members of this genus. Dogs seem to be particularly susceptible[76].",Not known in wild.,Original habitat is obscure.,(4 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumPorrum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AlliumPorrum2.jpg",,"Allium porrum is a BULB growing to 0.9 m (3ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.",,"The leaves and long white blanched stem are eaten cooked[2, 16, 37, 183]. They can also be cut into thin slices and be added to salads[183]. A mild onion flavour with a delightful sweetness[183, K]. Bulb - raw or cooked. The bulb is produced in the plants second year of growth (that is, after it is normally harvested). The bulb is somewhat larger if the plant is prevented from flowering[K]. Flowers - raw. Used as a garnish on salads, though they are rather on the dry side and less pleasant than many other members of the genus[K].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stings: Used in the treatment of stings and insect bites.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vasodilator: Widens the blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

These virtues are as follows:- Garlic has a very long folk history of use in a wide range of ailments, particularly ailments such as ringworm, Candida and vaginitis where its fungicidal, antiseptic, tonic and parasiticidal properties have proved of benefit[218]. It is also said to have anticancer activity[218]. Daily use of garlic in the diet has been shown to have a very beneficial effect on the body, especially the blood system and the heart. For example, demographic studies suggest that garlic is responsible for the low incidence of arteriosclerosis in areas of Italy and Spain where consumption of the bulb is heavy[222]. The bulb is said to be anthelmintic, antiasthmatic, anticholesterolemic, antiseptic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge, stimulant, stomachic, tonic, vasodilator[4, 9, 14, 21, 46, 165]. The crushed bulb may be applied as a poultice to ease the pain of bites, stings etc[4, 9, 14, 21].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].,,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1] but succeeds in most soils[16]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers an open situation[1, 37]. Does best in a soil that was well fed for a previous crop[1]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 8.3. The leek is a widely cultivated vegetable, there are many named varieties[183]. Young plants are often planted quite deeply in the soil (8 - 10cm deep) in order to blanch the lower stem, it is also a common practice to earth up the growing plants in order to blanch right the way up the stems. Whilst this does make the stems more tender, it also results in a loss of minerals and vitamins. Although commonly treated as a biennial, this plant is a true perennial, perennating by means of small lateral growths and often developing a roundish bulb at the base of the main growth[1]. A relatively slow-growing plant, it can be interplanted with faster maturing species such as lettuces[201]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, celery, celariac, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - for an early crop, or for larger plants, sow the seed in early spring in a greenhouse and plant out in May. For smaller or later plants, sow April in an outdoor seedbed and plant out as space permits in July or even August.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
