21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antibacterial  Antidote  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Poultice  StimulantBai Zhi has been used for thousands of years in Chinese herbal medicine where it is used as a sweat-inducing herb to counter harmful external influences[254]. Bai Zhi is contraindicated for pregnant women[254]. The root contains an essential oil, resins, furanocoumarins etc[283]. It is analgesic, anodyne, antibacterial, antidote, carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic, poultice and stimulant[176, 178, 218]. It is used in the treatment of frontal headache, tothache, rhinitis, boils, carbuncles and skin diseases[176, 279]. It appears to be of value in treating the facial pain of trigeminal neuralgia[254]. The roots are harvested in the autumn, dried and stored for later use[283]. Small quantities of angelicotoxin, one of the active ingredients in the root, have an excitatory effect on the respiratory centre, central nervous system and vasculomotor centre. It increases the rate of respiration, increases blood pressure, decreases the pulse, increases the secretion of saliva and induces vomiting[176]. In large doses it can cause convulsions and generalized paralysis[176].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a deep moist fertile soil in dappled shade or full sun[200]. Plants are reliably perennial if they are prevented from setting seed[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe since the seed only has a short viability[200]. Seed can also be sown in the spring, though germination rates will be lower. It requires light for germination[200]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. The seed can also be sow in situ as soon as it is ripe.",
