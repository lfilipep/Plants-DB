When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have plenty of seed then it can be sown in situ in the spring. Division in spring. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
