17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Hedge, Screen, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Requires a well-drained fertile soil in a sheltered position in sun or light shade[1, 200]. Prefers a warm soil that is not too heavy or close[11]. Tolerates calcareous soils[11, 200]. Dislikes windy sites[11]. The young shoots have a good resistance to damage by late frosts[188]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. There are a number of named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Stored seed will probably require stratification and should be sown as early in the year as possible[78]. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Basal cuttings in a frame[200]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame with gentle bottom heat[11, 78]. They take about 2 months to root and should be overwintered in a greenhouse, planting out in late spring[78]. Fair to good percentage[78]. Cuttings of almost ripe side shoots, 7 - 12cm with a heel, October/November in a cold frame[78]. Lift the following autumn and plant in their permanent positions[78]. Layering in autumn. Partially sever the layer about 12 months later and lift in the following spring. High percentage[200]."
