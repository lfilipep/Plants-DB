If this species is to be successfully cultivated, the soil should be low in nutrients, especially in nitrates and phosphates[200]. This species is not very cold-hardy, possibly tolerating temperatures down to around -5°c[260]. Plants require greenhouse protection in most parts of Britain[1] but high-altitude forms could succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[200].

Seal the pot in a plastic bag until germination takes place, which can take 1 - 3 months or more at 20°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.
