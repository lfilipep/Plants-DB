24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a well-drained lime-free soil and a sunny position[1, 200]. Thrives in acid sandy loams[167, 200]. Prefers a pH between 6.3 and 6.5[200]. Plants are tolerant of damp soils and sea winds[260]. If this species is to be successfully cultivated, the soil should be low in nutrients, especially in nitrates and phosphates[200]. This species is not very cold-hardy, possibly tolerating temperatures down to around -5°c[260]. Plants require greenhouse protection in most parts of Britain[1] but high-altitude forms could succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[200]. This species hybridizes in the wild with B. integrifolia and B. conferta penicillata[200]. A good bee plant[154, 167]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in an ericaceous compost as soon as the seed is ripe or as soon as it is obtained and do not exclude light. Seal the pot in a plastic bag until germination takes place, which can take 1 - 3 months or more at 20°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200]."
