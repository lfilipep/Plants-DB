See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Ground Cover; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall.

It makes a very addition to mixed salads in the winter, though we tend not to eat it much at other times of the year when there are more leaves available[K]. Flowers - raw. Produced in abundance, they have a pleasant sweet flavour and make a decorative addition to the salad bowl[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"A rampantly spreading plant, suitable for ground cover in a sunny position[187, 197, 208].",,"Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. We have seen plants doing very well on a north-west-facing wall[K]. Plants are very drought-tolerant and can be grown on a dry stone wall[200], they also succeed in poor soils[221]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A rampant spreading plant[188], it makes an excellent ground cover but can become a nuisance if it isn't sited with care[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. This species does not produce seed very freely in Britain, but it is very easily propagated by division[221]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The form 'E.K.Toogood' is less invasive[197]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, the plant can be divided at almost any time of the year[221].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
