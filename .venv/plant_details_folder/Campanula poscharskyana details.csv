19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[K]. A pleasant sweet flavour but the leaves are a little tough[K]. It makes a very addition to mixed salads in the winter, though we tend not to eat it much at other times of the year when there are more leaves available[K]. Flowers - raw. Produced in abundance, they have a pleasant sweet flavour and make a decorative addition to the salad bowl[K]."

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"A rampantly spreading plant, suitable for ground cover in a sunny position[187, 197, 208]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. We have seen plants doing very well on a north-west-facing wall[K]. Plants are very drought-tolerant and can be grown on a dry stone wall[200], they also succeed in poor soils[221]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. A rampant spreading plant[188], it makes an excellent ground cover but can become a nuisance if it isn't sited with care[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. This species does not produce seed very freely in Britain, but it is very easily propagated by division[221]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. The form 'E.K.Toogood' is less invasive[197]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, the plant can be divided at almost any time of the year[221]."
