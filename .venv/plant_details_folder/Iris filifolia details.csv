24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position[42, 79]. Requires a well-drained soil and needs to be kept dry in summer[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[190]. Plants are best grown in a cold frame in Britain to protect them from summer damp[79]. Bulbs should be planted 7 - 10cm deep and will require feeding after they have flowered[79]. The leaves appear in the autumn and require protection from severe frosts[90]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division, best done after flowering. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
