13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Acacia retinodes is an evergreen Tree growing to 6 m (19ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from February to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Flowers - cooked[144]. Rich in pollen, they are often used in fritters. Seed[144, 157]. No more details are given. The seedpods can be up to 18cm long[219]. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain approx 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat[278]. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present[278]. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated which is a distinct health advantage although it presents storage problems as such fats readily oxidise[278]. The mean total carbohydrate content of 55.8 + 13.7% is lower than that of lentils, but higher than that of soybeans while the mean fibre content of 32.3 + 14.3% is higher than that of other legumes such as lentils with a level of 11.7%[278]. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480+270 kJ per 100g[278]. Wattle seeds are low glycaemic index foods. The starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise[278].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. The extensive root system of this plant helps to prevent soil erosion[200].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained sandy loam and a very sunny position[1, 260], but it also stands drought and wet well[260]. Succeeds in any good garden soil, this species is said to be fairly lime tolerant[11, 166, 182, 200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position[166]. Plants are fairly tolerant of salt in the soil and salt-laden winds[260]. This species is said to be hardy from mid-Sussex southwards and westwards[1]. However, trees are not very hardy outdoors in most parts of Britain and even in the mildest areas of the country they are likely to be killed in excessively harsh winters[11]. A very ornamental tree[1]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Fair percentage[78].",
