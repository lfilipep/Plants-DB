If you have sufficient quantity the seed can be sown outdoors in situ in the autumn or the spring. Division in autumn or spring[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well.
