5,Habitats,"A shade-loving perennial sedge that is native to thickets and dry woodland areas. dry to mesic upland forests and shaded bluff ledges. It typically grows in loose colonies with a creeping habit. Roots are reddish brown. It is often found in areas with oak trees, hence the additional common name of oak sedge [368-1]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Carex pensylvanica is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. The flowers are pollinated by Wind, Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

20,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents."
21,Other Uses Description,"Capable of colonizing disturbed sites [277]. Groundcover for dry shade. Underplanting for shade perennials. Lawn substitute for dry soils in shady areas (forms a turf that never needs mowing or mow 2-3 times per year to 2"" tall). [368-1]. Provides cover for migratory fowl, sandhill cranes, and ducks (who also use the leaves for nesting material). It is also used by sharptail grouse and prairie chickens for nesting, cover, and dancing grounds [277]. Erosion Control. Ornamental: The leaves are soft and fine textured with an arching habit. It can be used as a lawn substitute [368-1]. Tolerant of mowing. Moderate salt tolerance."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers loose loams in dry soils in sun-dappled part shade. Most sedges prefer moist to wet soils, but not this one. Plants spread by rhizomes. Plants may self-seed in optimum growing conditions[368-1]. Soil pH: 4.0 - 8.0. Drought: Tolerant. Flood: Moderate. Salt: Moderate. Soil Compaction: Intolerant. Mowing: Tolerant. Does not compete well with larger plants in full sun. Competes well in moderate to deep shade. Can form dense mats. Makes one of the earliest spring appearances of the Carices. Life Span:Long-Lived Perennial. Stand Persistence:Long. Form: Clump. [368-1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. An evergreen. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,Plants spread by rhizomes. Plants may self-seed in optimum growing conditions. This species often does not grow well from seed.[368-1].
