The young growing tips are carminative, depurative, digestive and diuretic[7, 238]. They are gathered when in active growth in the spring and used fresh[7, 238].

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist light sandy or gravelly soil, doing very well between stones or by a south-east facing wall[37]. Requires a warm dry well-drained sunny position and shade from the midday sun[1, 200]. Requires saline conditions[200]. Plants are best grown in moist salty soil or a very well-drained poor dry soil. When grown away from the coast, this plant requires a warm sheltered position and some protection in cold winters[238]. At one time this plant was sometimes cultivated in the vegetable garden[2], though it is quite difficult to do this successfully[1, 37]. It is difficult to grow outside its natural habitat[164]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn[1]. Sow in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[164]. Germination usually takes place within 3 - 6 weeks at 15°c[164]. One report says that the seed only has a short viability and should be sown as soon as it is ripe[238], but it has germinated well with us when sown in April in a cold frame[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. Division in spring[238]."
