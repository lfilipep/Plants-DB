24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile humus-rich well-drained soil[200]. Other reports say that it requires a moist lime-free soil[167, 182]. Succeeds in full sun or partial shade[188]. This species is hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters. This species is said to succeed outdoors in our mildest gardens[182], especially if given a sheltered position such as a south or south-west facing wall[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Seed can be very slow to germinate, sometimes taking 2 years or more[157]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of almost ripe shoots, August/September in a sandy soil in a frame. The leaves should be left on the stem.[1, 200]"
