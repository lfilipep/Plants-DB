24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. A pond or bog garden plant, it requires a moist or wet loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. Prefers shallow, still or slowly flowing water up to 30 - 60cm deep. The flowers are monoecious. They are produced in whorls of three with a male flower at the top and two female flowers at the bottom[270]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a pot standing in about 5cm of water. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and gradually increase the depth of water as the plants grow until it is about 5cm above the top of the pot. Plant out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Division of the tubers in spring or autumn. Easy. Runners potted up at any time in the growing season."
