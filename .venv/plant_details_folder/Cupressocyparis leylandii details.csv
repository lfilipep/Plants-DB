Cupressus macrocarpa x Chamaecyparis nootkatensis.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CupressocyparisLeylandii.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CupressocyparisLeylandii2.gif","Form: Columnar, Oval, Pyramidal.","Cupressocyparis leylandii is an evergreen Tree growing to 40 m (131ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Hedge;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.","Plants can be grown as a windbreak hedge succeeding in very exposed positions and reasonably tolerant of maritime exposure[11, 75]. They can suffer wind burn after prolonged storms but usually recover quickly[75]. Very fast growing, it can be trimmed so long as it is not cut back into old wood[11, 200]. Only young plants should be used for shelterbelts in exposed positions and these must not be pot-bound or they will never become really wind firm[11]. This species has been much used for hedging in urban gardens but it is singularly unsuitable for this purpose[200]. Although it very quickly provides a screen, it is much too vigorous for most gardens and will need constant attention to keep it within bounds[200].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Christmas tree, Hedge, Screen, Seashore, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it prefers a moist fertile soil but also succeeds in sandy soils[188] and tolerates calcareous conditions[245]. Very wind resistant, it tolerates salt-laden winds and maritime exposure[11]. A very fast growing tree, capable of reaching 20 metres within 20 years[185]. A number of different clones are available[185, 200]. The Leyland cypress has been widely planted for hedging in recent years, though it is singularly unsuited for this purpose in all but the largest of sites[200]. The plant has gained the reputation of being very bad for wildlife since it offers native species very little in the way of food. However, it is favoured by many birds for roosting, high cover and especially for nesting because it offers such good cover. Our 12 hectare site was totally devoid of trees when we took it over in 1989, five years later we had our first birds nesting in trees on the land - in 4 metre tall Leyland cypresses![K]. Large specimens of this tree help to attract songbirds to the garden[200]. The bruised foliage has a sweet resinous scent[245]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, There are no flowers or blooms.","Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in sandy soil in a humid frame[11]. Strikes readily. Cuttings from side growths in March[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
