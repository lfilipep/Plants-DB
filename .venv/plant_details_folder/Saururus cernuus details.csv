Keep the pots moist by standing them in shallow water[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring[1, 200]. The plants spread freely and division is possible at almost any time in the growing season. Divisions taken in mid to late summer should be overwintered in pots in a cold frame and then be planted out in late spring. Regular division maintains the vigour of the plant[200]."
