Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Lemongrass was one of the herbs that was transported along the spice route from Asia to Europe. Lemon grass is a bitter, aromatic, cooling herb that increases perspiration and relieves spasms[ 238 ]. The essential oil obtained from the plant is an effective antifungal and antibacterial[ 238 ]. The essential oil contains about 70% citral, plus citronellal - both of these are markedly sedative[ 254 ]. Internally, the plant is used principally as a tea in the treatment of digestive problems, where it relaxes the muscles of the stomach and gut, relieving cramping pains and flatulence[ 254 ]. It is particularly useful for children, for whom it is also used to treat minor feverish illnesses[ 238 , 254 ]. Externally, especially in the form of the extracted essential oil, the plant is a very effective treatment for a range of conditions including athlete's foot, ringworm, lice and scabies[ 238 ]. It is also applied to ease the pain of arthritic joints[ 254 ].",

23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Border, Container, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Specimen. Agroforestry Uses: A good soil conditioner in worn out land. The plants quickly produce a bulk of organic material which soon rots down, attracting worms and other beneficial creatures and quickly enriching the soil[ 296 ]. A row of lemongrass plants can be used as a divider in the garden - it can help to contain more invasive plants such as sweet potato, and also as a barrier to prevent weeds growing into the garden[ 296 ]. The grass is useful for soil improvement and erosion control[ 418 ].. Other Uses An essential oil obtained from the plant is used in perfumery, scenting soaps, hair oils, cosmetics and as an insect repellent[ 238 , 254 , 418 ].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,400 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 24 - 30°c, but can tolerate 18 - 34°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 10°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 700 - 4,200mm[ 418 ]. Prefers a moisture-retentive soil in full sun[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 5.8, tolerating 4.3 - 7.3[ 418 ]. Harvesting begins when the crop is 120 - 240 days old, and the plant is subsequently harvested every 90 - 120 days[ 418 ]. The plant has an economical life of 4 years[ 418 ]. Fresh grass yields 0.2 - 0.4% oil, with an average yield of 50 - 120 kilos of oil/ha per annum. Yield of foliage is higher on fertile heavy soils, but under these conditions the oil usually has a lower citral content[ 418 ] The plant seldom flowers[ 418 ]. Lemongrass should be stored separately from other foods, or should be well wrapped, otherwise its strong scent will taint the other foods[ 200 ].",
