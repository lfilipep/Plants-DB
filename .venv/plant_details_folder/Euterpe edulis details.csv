13,Summary,"Jucara Palm or Euterpe edulis, otherwise known as jussara, acai-do-sul, or palmiteiro, is a tall, tropical palm tree primarily used for its palm heart. It grows usually about 10 m tall and 12 cm across. The trunk is light grey or brown in colour, and has prominent rings of leaf base scars. The leaves are dark green and have fine and feathery leaflets along the stalk. The fruits are small, round, and black to brown. Juice from the young stem is applied to wounds to stop bleeding. The leaves can be consumed raw or cooked. It is crunchy with a sweet flavour. The fruit has a thin, fleshy, fibrous pulp. It is made into a juice or ice cream. It can also be used to make alcohol or as a substitute to petrol. The wood is of low quality but can be used for rafters, beams, water troughs, and posts. A drink called Assai is obtained by crushing the seeds of Jucara palm. The unopened flower stalk is pickled. E. edulis is slow-growing."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of moist tropical and subtropical climates, where it is found at elevations from sea level to around 1,200 metres[ 418 ]. It grows in areas where the temperatures never fall below 10c, the average annual rainfall is 1,500mm or more and the driest month has 25mm or more rain[ 297 ]. Grows best in a warm, sheltered, and moist site that is well drained[ 314 ]. It likes filtered sunlight when young, but can take full sun as it matures[ 297 , 314 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 4.5 - 5, tolerating 4.1 - 5.6[ 418 ]. A fast-growing plant[ 200 ]. Utilizing the plant for its edible apical bud always leads to its eventual death since the palm is unable to form side branches and thus is unable to grow any more. This has led to plant populations coming under pressure in some areas[ 314 ]. Spacing: 6-8 ft. (1.8-2.4 m); 8-10 ft. (2.4-3 m); 10-12 ft. (3-3.6 m). They are grown commercially for palm hearts in Brazil."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a short viability of less than three months and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. Pre-soak them in cold water for 24 hours prior to sowing[ 419 ]. A germination rate of around 80% or more can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 30 - 70 days[ 419 ]. The seed germinates rapidly and grows quickly[ 297 ]."
