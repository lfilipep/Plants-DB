21,Other Uses Description,"- fairly heavy, durable in the soil, works well. Used for flooring, boat building, cabinet making. It is fairly resistant to some acids and has very little expansion or contraction due to moisture changes[156].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil containing leaf mold[1]. Succeeds in a good open soil but if it is to thrive it needs copious rainfall, high humidity and warmer conditions than are normally found in Britain[11, 200]. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. They might succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain but are very slow growing in cultivation[81].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings in a sandy soil in a cool or slightly warm frame in spring.",
