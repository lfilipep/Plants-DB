18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[101, 105, 118, 257]. It does not have a wonderful flavour, but is tolerable raw[K]. It can be harvested when still firm in August and when stored carefully will keep until November, by which time the flavour has improved slightly[K]. The fruit is about 10mm in diameter[200].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Tolerates maritime exposure and can be grown as an informal hedge[29, 49]. It provides reasonable shelter when in leaf but is rather bare and gives little protection in winter[K]. Fruit loved by birds. A good groundcover shrub for dry shade when planted with shorter groundcovers.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun, it is also quite tolerant of shade though it does not fruit so well in such a position[11]. Tolerates maritime exposure[49]. Hardy to about -25°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are a number of named varieties[182]. A plant labelled R. sanguineum carneum (which is probably the cultivar 'Carneum Grandiflorum') was seen at Kew with a very good crop of unripe fruit in July 1994[K]. A disease-resistant plant, the species is being used in blackcurrant breeding programmes[119]. Plants can harbour a stage of white pine blister rust, so should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Heat zone: 8-6.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at between 0 and 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",
