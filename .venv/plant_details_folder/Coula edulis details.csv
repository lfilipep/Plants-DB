21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The heartwood is dark red or violet brownish-red with dark brown veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 4cm wide band of pinkish-brown sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked, sometimes wavy. The wood is very hard, very heavy, elastic, and very durable, resisting water well and resistant to fungal and insect attack, particularly termites and marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of distortion and checking; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect upon tools, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide are recommended; it polishes well; is easy to work, but has the disadvantage of being liable to shake and crack; it takes nails and screws well so long as it is pre-bored; gluing is correct for interior use only. In great demand, the wood is used in turnery and as a substitute for mahogany, as well as for heavy carpentry, industrial flooring, piles for bridges and railway ties[ 46 , 63 , 303 , 418 , 848 ]. The wood produces a suitable charcoal[ 303 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of the hot, humid, lowland tropics. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 25 - 35°c, but can tolerate 20 - 40°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 800 - 2,500mm[ 418 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in partial shade[ 418 ]. Shading is beneficial when plants are young[ 303 ]. The tree has no special soil requirements[ 303 ]. Prefers a well-drained soil[ 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7[ 418 ]. Fruit is normally borne plentifully in the wild[ 303 ].",
