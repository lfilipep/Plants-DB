Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses: The heartwood is dark red or violet brownish-red with dark brown veins; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 4cm wide band of pinkish-brown sapwood. The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked, sometimes wavy. The wood is very hard, very heavy, elastic, and very durable, resisting water well and resistant to fungal and insect attack, particularly termites and marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of distortion and checking; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect upon tools, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide are recommended; it polishes well; is easy to work, but has the disadvantage of being liable to shake and crack; it takes nails and screws well so long as it is pre-bored; gluing is correct for interior use only. In great demand, the wood is used in turnery and as a substitute for mahogany, as well as for heavy carpentry, industrial flooring, piles for bridges and railway ties[ 46 , 63 , 303 , 418 , 848 ]. The wood produces a suitable charcoal[ 303 ].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products.
