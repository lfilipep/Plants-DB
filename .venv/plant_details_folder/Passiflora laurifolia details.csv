Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Bitter  Narcotic  Poultice  Vermifuge  Vitamin CThe content of the glycoside passiflorin can produce weak narcotic effects[317 ]. (I believe this is found mainly in the leaves or roots[K ].) A cold, salted decoction of the root is said to be an effective vermifuge[348 ]. An infusion of the stems and leaves is used as a children's vermifuge[348 ]. The leaves are vermifuge[348 ]. The powdered leaves are bitter and considered to be an anthelmintic[348 ]. A poultice of the leaves is used for dressing syphilitic ulcers[348 ]. The green fruit contains acetone and a cyanogenic heteroside which disappears upon maturity of the fruit[348 ]."
22,Other Uses,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.
23,Other Uses Description,Other Uses Sometimes used as a rootstock for P. edulis because it is less susceptible to soil borne disease[335 ].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the hot, wet, lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 500 metres[335 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 30°c, but can tolerate 12 - 36°c[418 ]. The plant is not tolerant of frost[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 4,000mm[418 ]. Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7[418 ]. Plants produce tendrils and climb by attaching these to other plants. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262 ]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24°c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262 ]. Cuttings of fully mature wood taken at a node. They can take 3 months, but there is usually a high percentage[3 ]. Layering. Very easy[262 ]. Air layering."
