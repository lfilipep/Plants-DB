24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a peaty sandy soil and very careful watering[1]. Succeeds in poor soils[193]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Plants are only likely to succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of the country[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. The seed can be very slow to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out in early summer. Cuttings can be taken though it is usually hard to find sufficient material[175].",
