Plants tolerate temperatures down to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Plants are only likely to succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of the country[200].","Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. The seed can be very slow to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out in early summer. Cuttings can be taken though it is usually hard to find sufficient material[175].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
