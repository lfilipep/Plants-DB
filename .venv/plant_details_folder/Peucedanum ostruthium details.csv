It was held in high regard in the Middle Ages where it was especially valued for its ability to resolve all flatulence in the body and stimulate the flow of urine and menstruation[254]. It was also used in treating rheumatic conditions, shortness of breath, kidney and bladder stones, water retention and wounds[254]. The root is antispasmodic, aromatic, bitter, strongly carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, febrifuge, stimulant and stomachic[4, 7, 9, 21, 254]. It is of use in the treatment of asthma, dyspepsia and menstrual complaints[4], an infusion helps to relieve migraine[7]. The root is gathered in the spring or autumn and dried for later use[7, 9]. An essential oil from the plant has a euphoric and odontalgic effect[7]. Used externally, it relieves skin irritation[7]. When used externally, the plant or the extracted essential oil can cause an allergic reaction to sunlight[254]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the roots[9].
