See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Milk: made from plants, that is.,Oil: ","eed - raw or cooked[2 , 46 , 105 ]. Pleasantly flavoured and nutritious[1 , 61 ], the seed is a little sweeter than the related Macadamia integrifolia and contains a little less oil[301 ]. They can be eaten as a dessert nut and can also be ground into a flour and then mixed with cereal flours to enrich the protein content. The shell is very hard, making it difficult to extract the seed[260 ]. The seed is up to 30mm long and 24mm wide[286 ]. The seed contains up to 72% of a high grade oil[156 , 183 ]. This oil is seldom extracted due to the high value of the seed[63 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Integrifolia[418].",,"Macadamia tetraphylla succeeds in cool tropical or subtropical climates - in Australia they fruit well even when growing at least as far south as Sydney[157, 335]. In the tropics the plant fruits best at elevations from 1,000 - 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 14 - 28°c, but can tolerate 8 - 38°c[418]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -2°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1°c[418]. The plant can survive slight frosts, though cold weather can result in the loss of the entire crop[200]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,250 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 850 - 3,000mm[418].Plants grow best in rich moist but well-drained soils and a position in full sun[117]. They require copious summer watering in their early stages[167]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 8[418]. Trees require a sheltered position and are easily damaged by strong winds[117, 200].Plants are slow growing in cultivation, seedlings take 6 - 7 years to produce their first fruit[117, 167]. The trees then produce commercial crops for about 40 - 50 years and can fruit for up to 100 years[200].There are some named varieties[167, 183].Plants are self-fertile but yield better if cross-pollinated[117].Pruning is not normally necessary, but is tolerated if carried out in the autumn[188].",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a nursery bed[188]. The dehusked seed germinates quickly at 25°c[200].Cultivars may be grafted. Side wedge grafting has been used exclusively in Hawaii[303].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
