24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in full sun though it also tolerates partial shade[1, 200, 208]. Plants are very drought-tolerant and can be grown on a dry stone wall[200], they also succeed in poor soils[221]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Closely related to C. garganica, differing in its larger leaves, longer stems and fewer flowers. The pollen is blue, whilst that of C. garganica is yellow[271]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, the plant can be divided at almost any time of the year[221].",
