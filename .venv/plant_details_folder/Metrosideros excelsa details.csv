Plants are somewhat lime-tolerant but are unsuitable for shallow soils over chalk[200]. Very resistant to maritime exposure[166, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[184] and succeeding outdoors only in the mildest areas of the country where it makes a small shrub[1, 200]. Plants grow very well on the Isles of Scilly, where they are cut back by cold perhaps once every twenty years. They usually sprout again from their thick branches[260]. A good bee plant[173]. Very ornamental[1]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a warm greenhouse and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors.
