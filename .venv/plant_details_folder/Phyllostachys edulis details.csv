See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",P. mitis. P. pubescens. H. de Lehar. Bambusa edulis.

Very palatable when cooked but acrid raw[25, 74, 183]. Not of the highest quality, but their large size makes them very popular[195]. Extensively eaten in China, they are usually cooked in one change of water[183]. The shoots are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level. The dormant young shoots, harvested in the winter before they emerge above the ground, are especially relished as a delicacy[183, 195].","Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  AntirheumaticThe leaves are used in the treatment of arthritic inflammations[218]. The sheaths of the stem are used in the treatment of nausea and sour stomach[218].,"Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers.

The short internodes at the lower end of the cane are used as flasks, vases etc[74]. Although the wood is relatively soft, the canes are much used for heavy construction, weaving various types of handicrafts and paper making[195]. The rhizomes are used as walking sticks and umbrella handles. Carbon farming - Industrial Crop: biomass. : bank. Other Systems: multistrata.","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Managed Multistem: Regularly removing some multiple stems. A non-A non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Managed Multistem  Minor Global Crop  Other Systems: MultistrataRequires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position[200] with plenty of moisture in the growing season[162]. Likes abundant sunshine[11]. A fairly cold-hardy plant, succeeding outdoors in many areas of Britain. It tolerates temperatures down to about -15°c according to one report, but the plants are slow to recover from damage caused by cold weather[11]. They also dislike prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. Plants grow well in Cornwall making a very good sized clump. The young shoots are very fast growing, up to 30cm per day[11], and are produced from late April[25]. The rootstock is running but it is practically static in cool climates[25]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. Young plants can be difficult to establish, new plantings only grow slowly at first and often fail completely if soil and water conditions are less than the best[195]. This species, but especially its cultivar 'Pubescens'[266] is extensively cultivated for its edible young shoots and other uses in China and Japan[46, 183, 266], it is the most commonly cultivated bamboo in China and the second most common in Japan[195]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: managed multistem.","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
