13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pinus elliottii is an evergreen Tree growing to 25 m (82ft) by 18 m (59ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The seeds of all Pinus species are more or less edible, and some are of good size and make very tasty and nutritious foods, often eaten in quantitiy. Others can be less desireable, either having a strongly resinous flavour, being bitter or, more commonly, rather too small and fiddly to make it very worthwhle even trying to eat them, We have no specific information of the desireability of this species, though they are rather small (the size given includes the shell)[K]. The dark brown seeds are 6 - 7mm long[329].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.UrinaryThe plant contains turpentine, This has long been used internally for the treatment of catarrh, chronic bowel inflammation, colds, gonorrhea, leucorrhea, rheumatism, as well as various urinary complaints, rheumatism, and ulcers[269 ]",
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"Oleoresin is tapped from the trees and distilled to obtain 12 - 13% turpentine and rosin[299 ]. Turpentine is used in the paint industry[299 ]. Rosin is used in the production of paper, soap and glue[299 ]. An essential oil is distilled from the needles[299 ]. The leaves yield around 0.3% of a balsam scented oil[269 ]. The main components are alpha-pinene (43.0%), beta-pinene (27.1%) and alpha-terpineol (9.6%)[299 ]. The heartwood is yellow to red-brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the 5 - 15cm wide band of yellowish white sapwood. The grain is straight, sometimes spiral; texture medium; growth rings are distinct. The wood is heavy, hard, tough, moderately durable to non-durable, being susceptible to attacks by Anobium borers, marine borers and termites. The resin content of the wood is high. The wood dries with little degrade, although some surface checking and splitting down the centre may occur. The wood is relatively difficult to work; resin may adhere to sawteeth and cutting edges, but the use of long-pitched sawteeth reduces this problem; it holds nails and screws well; glues, finishes and paints satisfactorily. The lightweight and soft wood from younger trees is mainly used for pulping, whereas the heavier and harder wood of older trees is used as timber. The straightness of the bole makes it particularly suitable for poles, piles and solid-wood products, but treatment with preservatives is often necessary. The wood is also suitable for construction, flooring, frames, joinery, interior trim, furniture, cabinet work, ship and boat building, vehicle bodies, toys, turnery, boxes, crates, veneer, plywood and particle board[299 , 672 ]. The wood is used for fuel[299 ]. Carbon Farming (Pinus elliottii and Pinus elliottii x caribea) - They can be used as an industrial crop - hydrocarbon and for agroforestry services as a windbreak.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world. The annual value of each is more than $1 billion US Examples include coconuts, almonds, and bananas.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Global Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: StandardSlash pine is a plant of the subtropics, but it can be cultivated in tropical regions at elevations from 500 - 2,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 32°c, but can tolerate 8 - 36°c[418 ]. When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -5°c, but young growth can be severely damaged at 0°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 650 - 2,500mm[418 ]. Grows best in a sunny position[418 ]. Succeeds in a wide range of soils, growing best on mesic flatwood sites and on pond or stream margins where soil moisture is ample but not excessive, and drainage is poor[418 ]. Established stands grow well on flooded sites, but flooding restricts seedling establishment[418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 4.5 - 5.5, but tolerant of 4 - 6.5[418 ]. Tolerant of maritime exposure[418 ]. Widely planted for timber outside its native range, it has sometimes escaped and become naturalized. It can establish dense stands that shade out native plants and prevent their regeneration. Invaded grasslands are transformed over time into species poor shrublands and forests[305 ] A fast growing tree when young, it can live about 200 years[418 ]. Trees commence producing seed when around 7 - 8 years old[299 ]. Some seeds are produced each year, with good crops about every third year[379 ]. Individual cones take about 3 years to mature[299 ]. Annual oleoresin yields of 3 kilos per tree have been recorded from Zimbabwe[299 ]. Young trees are quite susceptible to fire injury until they are 3 - 4.5 metres tall, but then the bark becomes thick enough to insulate the cambium from high temperatures[299 ]. The tree has an extensive lateral root system and a moderate taproot[418 ]. Two geographic varieties exist for this species. The typical Pinus elliottii elliottii is found in the northern part of the range whilst Pinus elliottii densa is only found in southern Florida[418 ]. Both Pinus elliottii and Pinus elliottii x caribea are good Carbon Farming plants and have been partially domesticated to increase yields and other traits. They can be used as an industrial crop - hydrocarbon and for agroforestry services as a windbreak.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - germination normally takes 15 - 20 days, and the germination rate of fresh seeds is usually 80 - 95%. The presence of mycorrhizae is highly beneficial for survival and early growth, so it is recommended to inoculate with spores or to add soil from near established trees. Seedlings can be planted out 4 - 8 months after germination, when they are about 30cm tall[299 ]. The seeds can be stored for years under dry, cold and airtight conditions[299 ].",
