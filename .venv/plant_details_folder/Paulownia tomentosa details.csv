24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Firewood, Pest tolerant, Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen. Requires a deep moderately fertile moisture retentive but well-drained soil in a sunny sheltered position[11, 200]. Plants are tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental and fast growing plant[11]. The flower buds are formed in autumn and can be excited into premature growth during mild winter weather, this growth is then more susceptible to frost damage[1, 11]. The flower buds are hardy to about -15°c when dormant[200]. Plants, and especially seedlings less than 2 years old, are frost tender when young[11, 200]. They do not flower reliably in maritime zones, this is probably due to insufficient warmth and dryness in the summer[200]. Branches tend to be brittle[200]. The flowers have a delicate sweet fragrance[245]. Trees can be coppiced annually, they will then produce very vigorous growth with leaves up to 1 metre wide[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in late winter in a greenhouse at 15 - 20°c[78]. The seed requires light for germination[200]. Fair to good germination. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Overwinter in a cold frame for its first year and plant out in late spring[200]. Root cuttings 4cm long in December. Good percentage[78]."
