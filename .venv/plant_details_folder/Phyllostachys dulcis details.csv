13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Phyllostachys dulcis is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 7 m (23ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young shoots - raw or cooked. Free of any acridity, they make excellent eating[183]. Used in salads, soups, stews etc, this is one of the most highly esteemed edible bamboos in China[183, 195]. The shoots, which are 4 - 6cm in diameter[266], are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level."

23,Other Uses Description,Canes can be used for industrial purposes but are weaker than many other members of this genus[195]. The culms are used as handles of farm tools[266].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position. Dislikes drought[195]. A fairly hardy species, but it dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts. One report says that it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c[200], down to -20°c in another report, though this report also says that this species does not like growing in areas with frequent low temperatures[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The new growth emerges in early spring. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. Cultivated in China for its edible young shoots[183, 266]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 10 through 7. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200]. Basal cane cuttings in spring."
