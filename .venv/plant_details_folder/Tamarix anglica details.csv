13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Tamarix anglica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft 5in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"na is produced by the plants in response to insect damage to the stems[2, 105]. It is sweet and mucilaginous[105].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  DiureticAstringent, diuretic[7].",
22,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Very tolerant of maritime exposure, it makes a good shelter hedge in coastal gardens[7, 11, 49, 75]. Dislikes being trimmed[75]. The extensive root system of this plant makes it suitable for use in erosion control in sandy soils[149].  - fairly hard, not strong, close grained, takes a high polish. Used for general construction, poles, turnery[61, 149]. It makes a good fuel, burning well even when green due to the wax content of the wood[74].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils and tolerant of saline conditions[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils as well as in sands and even shingle[182]. Usually found near the coast, it succeeds inland if given a fairly good deep loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Tolerant of maritime winds and dry soils when grown near the coast[11], plants require a moister soil and shelter from cold drying winds when they are grown inland in non-saline soils because they use the soil salts that are found in saline soils to help them reduce transpiration[200]. Growth can be restricted by cutting back the plants in spring, hedges are also best trimmed at this time[188]. This species is very closely related to T. gallica and is considered to be no more than a part of that species by many botanists[11, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very easy[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, 15 - 25cm long, planted outdoors in late autumn in a nursery bed or straight into their permanent position. High percentage[11, 200].",
