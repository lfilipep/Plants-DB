It is native to the moist swampy woods and damp coastal areas of the southeast U.S. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or full sun. The plant can tolerate strong winds but not maritime exposure. Myrica cerifera L. is a synonym of Morella cerifera (L.) Small. Bloom Color: Green. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Vase.","Myrica cerifera is an evergreen Shrub growing to 9 m (29ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from April to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.","Cerothamnus arborescens, Cerothamnus cerifer, Morella cerifera, Myrica mexicana, Myrica pumila.",Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,Fruit: ,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","eaFruit - raw or cooked[105, 177, 183]. The fruit is about 3mm in diameter with a large seed[200]. There is very little edible flesh and the quality is poor[K]. Leaves and berries are used as a food flavouring[62, 105, 177]. They make an aromatic, attractive and agreeable substitute for bay leaves, and can be used in flavouring soups, stews etc[183]. The dried leaves are brewed into a robust tea[183].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Narcotic: Relieves pain, induces drowsiness and gives a sense of well-being.,Sternutatory: Promotes sneezing and nasal discharges.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Astringent  Dysentery  Emetic  Narcotic  Sternutatory  Stimulant  TonicWax myrtle is a popular herbal remedy in North America where it is employed to increase the circulation, stimulate perspiration and keep bacterial infections in check[254]. The plant should not be used during pregnancy[254]. The root bark is antibacterial, astringent, emetic (in large doses), sternutatory, stimulant and tonic[4, 21, 46, 165, 213, 254]. It is harvested in the autumn, thoroughly dried then powdered and kept in a dark place in an airtight container[4]. It is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, irritable bowel syndrome, jaundice, fevers, colds, influenza, catarrh, excessive menstruation, vaginal discharge etc[4, 238, 254]. Externally, it is applied to indolent ulcers, sore throats, spongy gums, sores, itching skin conditions, dandruff etc[4, 238, 254]. The wax is astringent and slightly narcotic[4]. It is regarded as a sure cure for dysentery and is also used to treat internal ulcers[4]. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment of fevers and externally as a wash for itchy skin[222].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wax: Used for making candles etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A wax covering on the fruit contains palmitic acid and is extracted by scalding the fruit with boiling water and immersing them for a few minutes, the wax floats to the surface and is then skimmed off. The fruit is then boiled in water to extract the wax from the pulp and once more the wax is skimmed off. It is then strained through a muslin cloth and can be used to make aromatic candles, sealing wax etc[1, 4, 6, 11, 62, 95, 171, 245, 274]. Candles made from this wax are quite brittle but are less greasy in warm weather[213]. They are slightly aromatic, with a pleasant balsamic odour[245], and do not smoke when put out, making them much more pleasant to use that wax or tallow candles[213]. The wax is also used in making soaps[213]. About 1 kilo of wax can be obtained from 4 kilos of berries[4]. A blue dye is obtained from the fruit[6]. The plant can be grown as an informal hedge[200], succeeding in windy sites[K].  - light, soft, brittle, fine-grained[82, 227]. The wood weighs 35lb per cubic foot[227]. It is of no commercial value[229].","Industrial Crop: Wax: Water resistant, malleable substances. Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Wild-harvested and Sold: Some wild plants have strong historic or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed.","Industrial Crop: Wax  Management: Standard  Wild-harvested and SoldLandscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Screen, Seashore, Specimen. Prefers a moist soil[200]. Grows well in an open position in a well-drained soil in sun or light shade[200]. Thrives in any ordinary garden soil according to one report[11] whilst another says that it thrives in an acid soil[182]. Prefers a lime-free loamy or peaty soil[1]. Plants can be evergreen in areas with warmer winters than in Britain[227]. Some reports say that the plant is dioecious whilst others say it is monoecious. It is most likely that both forms exist[82, K]. A polymorphic species[11], there are some named forms. 'Myda' is a large-fruited female form of low growth[182]. The fruit is covered with a deposit of wax that has a balsamic odour[245]. The fruits can hang on the plant for several years[213]. Closely related to M. pensylvanica, with which it hybridizes[43]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Many species in this genus have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Fragrant foliage, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. An evergreen. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[78]. Stored seed germinates more freely if given a 3 month cold stratification and then sown in a cold frame[78]. Germination is usually good[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up and overwinter in a cold frame then plant out in late spring or early summer. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
