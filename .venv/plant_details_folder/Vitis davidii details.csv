0,Vitis davidii,Spiny Vitis,Vitaceae,6-9,None known,"Usually found growing into trees and shrubs in thickets on hillsides and in valleys[109, 266].",E. Asia - China.,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Vitis davidii is a deciduous Climber growing to 15 m (49ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",V. armata. Spinovitis davidii.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ",,"Fruit - raw or dried for winter use[1, 61]. A harsh flavour[22, 183]. A pleasant flavour according to other reports[11, 200]. Small but sweet[182]. The fruit is about 16mm in diameter[200]. Young leaves are wrapped around other foods and then baked, they impart a pleasant flavour[55]. Young tendrils - raw or cooked[55, 85].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A yellow dye is obtained from the fresh or dried leaves[168]. Plants can be used as a ground cover in a sunny position[188]. They are best spaced about 3.5 metres apart each way[208]. They can be encouraged to cover the ground by laying brushwood flat on the ground and pegged into position. The twigs would eventually rot and the plant would assume complete and constant control[208].,,"Prefers a deep rich moist well-drained moderately fertile loam[1, 200]. Grows best in a calcareous soil[200]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though a warm sunny position is required for the fruit to ripen[200]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Plants climb by means of tendrils[182]. They grow particularly well into elm trees[18]. Any pruning should be carried out in winter when the plants are dormant otherwise they bleed profusely[182, 200]. Plants are occasionally cultivated for their edible fruits[46, 61]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[K]. Six weeks cold stratification improves the germination rate, and so stored seed is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is obtained. Germination should take place in the first spring, but sometimes takes another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in early summer. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth, December/January in a frame. These cuttings can be of wood 15 - 30cm long or they can be of short sections of the stem about 5cm long with just one bud at the top of the section. In this case a thin, narrow strip of the bark about 3cm long is removed from the bottom half of the side of the stem. This will encourage callusing and the formation of roots. Due to the size of these cuttings they need to be kept in a more protected environment than the longer cuttings.
