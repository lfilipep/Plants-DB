14,Physical Characteristics,"Cercocarpus montanus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft 1in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
19,Edible Uses Description,,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Laxative  Stomachic  TonicAn infusion of the leaves has been used as a general strengthened to the system[257]. The roots and the bark have been used in the treatment of stomach complaints[257]. A cold infusion of the plant or leaves has been used as a laxative[257].,
22,Other Uses,"Broom: Used for sweeping the floor etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Bunches of the tied stems have been used as rough brooms[257]. A red to brown dye can be obtained from the root bark[257]. The bark is often mixed with alder and wild plum root barks when making the dye[257]. Tolerant of maritime exposure and amenable to training, this species can be grown as a hedge in seaside gardens[K]. The wood is heavy, hard and brittle[82]. It makes a valuable fuel and is occasionally used in the manufacture of small articles for domestic and industrial use[82].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Hedge, Screen. Requires a perfectly drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerant of salt spray[200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. This species has many sub-species. Whilst some forms are hardy to about -17°c when in a suitable soil and position, other forms are frost tender. The hardiest forms, succeeding in zone 5, are C. montanus argenteus (Rydb.)F.L.Matinn and C. montanus glaber (S.Wats.)F.L.Martin. Less hardy are C. montanus paucidentatus (S.Wats.)F.L.Martin which succeeds in zone 7, C. montanus blanchae (C.Schneid.)F.L.Martin and C. montanus minutiflorus (Abrams.)F.L.Martin are hardy in zone 8 whilst C. montanus traskiae (Eastw.)F.L.Martin. is the least hardy, to zone 9[200]. Some members of this genus have a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200, 212].  Special Features:North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow autumn or late winter in a cold frame. Seed of the more tender forms is best sown in the late winter whilst hardier forms are best sown in the autumn. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame.",
