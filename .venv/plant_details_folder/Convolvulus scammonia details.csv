19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cathartic  HydrogogueA resin is obtained from the root. The earth is cleared away from the top of the root, the top is then cut off obliquely about 5cm below the point where the stalks spring forth. The exuding juice is collected, which gradually hardens[4]. This resin is a drastic cathartic and hydrogogue and should be used with great caution[4, 46, 61]. The roots contain about 8% resin[240].",

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light basic sharply drained soil of low to medium fertility[4, 200]. Prefers a sunny sheltered position. Thrives in dry soils[4] and succeeds in ordinary garden soils. The root can be up to 1.2 metres long, so for best results a deep soil is required[4].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[164]. Germination can be slow and erratic, a period of cold stratification might help reduce the germination period. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Cuttings of young shoots, August in a frame in sand[1].",
