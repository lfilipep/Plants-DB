This thick liquid is then poured onto a board to dry in cakes and can be kept for an indefinite period. When needed it is soaked in hot water until the correct consistency for paint is achieved[207].

A frost tender plant, it can be grown as a summer annual in Britain[200]. A very good bee plant, it is often planted by apiarists in America[207]. This plant was probably cultivated by the N. American Indians[85]. The Indians would allow the plant to produce seed when it was growing wild in the cornfields in order to ensure a supply the following year[216].","Seed - surface sow or only lightly cover the seed in spring in a greenhouse[164]. The seed usually germinates in 5 - 14 days at 25°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring. Day time temperatures below 20°c depress germination but a night time fall to 20° is necessary[164].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
