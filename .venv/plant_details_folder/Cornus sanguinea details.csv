23,Other Uses Description,"The seed contains 45% of a non-drying oil[74], it is used in soap making and lighting[7, 13, 100, 115, 177]. A non-drying oil is also obtained from the pericarp, it is used for lighting[74]. The pericarp contains 19 - 35% oil[74]. A greenish-blue dye is obtained from the fruit[13, 74]. The young stems are very flexible and are used in basketry[7, 13, 74, 100].  - tough, hard. Used for small items such as tool handles, turnery etc[11, 61, 115]. A good quality charcoal is obtained from the wood[115], the wood also makes an excellent fuel[115].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are relatively shade tolerant, though they are not happy when growing in dense shade[186]. They grow badly when exposed to strong cold winds[186]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. The flowers have a rather unpleasant smell to most people, though they are attractive to insects[186]. Plants have a suckering habit and can quickly form dense thickets[186]. They can be coppiced regularly and will throw up long straight stems after being cut back[186]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",
