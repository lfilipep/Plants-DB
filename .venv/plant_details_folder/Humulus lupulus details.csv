4,Known Hazards,"Skin contact with the plant causes dermatitis in sensitive people[222]. Hops dermatitis has long been recognized. Not only hands and face, but legs have suffered purpuric eruptions due to hop picking. Although only 1 in 3,000 workers is estimated to be treated, one in 30 are believed to suffer dermatitis[269]. Dislodged hairs from the plant can irritate the eyes[222]. Sedative effect may worsen depression. Avoid during pregnancy (due to antispasmodic action on uterus). Avoid with breast, uterine and cervical cancers [301].",

13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Green, Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer, Mid summer. Form: Spreading or horizontal, Variable spread.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Humulus lupulus is a PERENNIAL CLIMBER growing to 6 m (19ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Rutin: often used as a food supplement.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"TeaYoung leaves and young shoots - cooked[2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 33, 37]. The flavour is unique and, to many tastes, delicious[183]. Young leaves can be eaten in salads[1, 183]. Use before the end of May[12]. The leaves contain rutin[218]. The fleshy rhizomes are sometimes eaten[183]. A tea is made from the leaves and cones[183]. It has a gentle calming effect[4]. The dried flowering heads of female plants are used as a flavouring and preservative in beer[2, 183]. They are also medicinal[2]. The flowering heads are sprinkled with bitter-tasting yellow translucent glands, which appear as a granular substance[4]. This substance prevents gram-negative bacteria from growing in the beer or wort[269]. Much of the hop's use as a flavouring and medicinal plant depends on the abundance of this powdery substance[4]. The seeds contain gamma-linolenic acid, an essential fatty acid that is said to have many important functions in the human body and is rarely found in plant sources[218]. The essential oil in the flowering heads is used as a flavouring in cereal beverages and mineral waters[269]. Extracts from the plant, and the oil, are used as flavouring in non-alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods and puddings, with the highest average maximum use level of 0.072% reported for an extract used in baked goods[269].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antianxiety: Helps relieve anxiety. See also Nervine and Sedative.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Leprosy: Used to treat leprosy - a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and superficial nerves (in the skin) caused by Mycobacterium leprae.,Nervine: Stimulates and calms the nerves.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antianxiety  Antibacterial  Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Appetizer  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Galactogogue  Hypnotic  Leprosy  Nervine  Sedative  Stomachic  TonicHops have a long and proven history of herbal use, where they are employed mainly for their soothing, sedative, tonic and calming effect on the body and the mind. Their strongly bitter flavour largely accounts for their ability to strengthen and stimulate the digestion, increasing gastric and other secretions[254]. The female fruiting body is anodyne, antiseptic, antispasmodic, diuretic, febrifuge, hypnotic, nervine, sedative, stomachic and tonic[4, 9, 21, 46, 165, 192, 218]. Hops are widely used as a folk remedy to treat a wide range of complaints, including boils, bruises, calculus, cancer, cramps, cough, cystitis, debility, delirium, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, fever, fits, hysteria, inflammation, insomnia, jaundice, nerves, neuralgia, rheumatism, and worms[269]. The hairs on the fruits contain lupulin, a sedative and hypnotic drug[213, 218]. When given to nursing mothers, lupulin increases the flow of milk - recent research has shown that it contains a related hormone that could account for this effect[7]. The decoction from the flower is said to remedy swellings and hardness of the uterus[269]. Hop flowers are much used as an infusion or can also be used to stuff pillows where the weight of the head will release the volatile oils[213]. The fruit is also applied externally as a poultice to ulcers, boils, painful swellings etc[4, 218], it is said to remedy painful tumours[269]. The female flowering heads are harvested in the autumn and can be used fresh or dried[238]. Alcoholic extracts of hops in various dosage forms have been used clinically in treating numerous forms of leprosy, pulmonary tuberculosis, and acute bacterial dysentery, with varying degrees of success in China. The female fruiting body contains humulone and lupulone, these are highly bacteriostatic against gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria[240]. A cataplasm of the leaf is said to remedy cold tumours[269]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Humulus lupulus for nervousness and insomnia (see [302] for critics of commission E).",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A fine brown dye is obtained from the leaves and flower heads[4, 100, 269]. An essential oil from the female fruiting heads is used in perfumery[213, 238]. Average yields are 0.4 - 0.5%[240]. Extracts of the plant are used in Europe in skin creams and lotions for their alleged skin-softening properties[269]. A fibre is obtained from the stems[46]. Similar to hemp (Cannabis sativa)[100] but not as strong[115], it is used to make a coarse kind of cloth[4]. It is sometimes used for filler material in corrugated paper or board products, but is unsuited for corrugated paper because of low pulp yield and high chemical requirement, or for production of high-grade pulp for speciality paper[269]. The fibre is very durable but it is difficult to separate, the stems need to be soaked beforehand for a whole winter[4]. A paper can also be made from the fibre, the stems are harvested in the autumn, the leaves removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be removed. The fibre is cooked for 2 hours with lye and then hand pounded with mallets or ball milled for 2½ hours. The paper is brown in colour[189].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Screen. Easily grown in a good garden soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 53]. Prefers a deep rich loam[37] and a warm sheltered position[187]. Plants can succeed in dry shade if plenty of humus is incorporated into the soil, once established they are also somewhat drought tolerant[190]. Hops are reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of between 31 and 137cm, an annual temperature in the range of 5.6 to 21.3°C and a pH of 4.5 to 8.2[269]. Plants are very hardy tolerating temperatures down to about -20°c when dormant[187]. The young shoots in spring, however, can be damaged by any more than a mild frost[269]. A climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around the branches of other plants[219]. Hops are frequently cultivated, both commercially and on a domestic scale, in temperate zones for their seed heads which have many medicinal qualities and are also used as a flavouring and preservative in beer. There are many named varieties[183]. They grow best between the latitudes of 35 - 51°N and 34 - 43°S, with mean summer temperatures of 16 - 18°C[269]. Generally, for beer making, the unfertilized seed heads are preferred and so most male plants are weeded out[4]. Hops are fairly deep rooted, but with a network of shallow feeding roots. These horizontal feeding roots spread out at depth of 20 - 30 cm in the soil and give rise to fibrous roots in upper layers of soil[269]. The vertical roots develop downwards to a depth of about 150 cm with a spread of 183 - 244 cm and have no fibrous roots[269]. The bruised leaves are refreshingly aromatic whilst the flowers cast a pleasing scent[245]. A food plant for many caterpillars[30]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Edible, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for dried flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. Growth habit is a single or multiple shooting vine from a crown [1-2]. Herbaceous. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[37]. Germination is fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out in the summer or following spring. Division in spring as new growth begins[1]. Very easy, you can plant the divisions straight out into their permanent positions if required[K]. Basal cuttings in March. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",
