Requires a sheltered position[11] in full sun[200]. Succeeds in semi-shade[188]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it only succeeds outdoors in the milder areas of the country[11, 182] and even there is best grown on a south or west-facing wall[188]. The leaves are very aromatic[182]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required[182]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Cuttings of mature basal hardwood of the previous seasons growth, mid to late winter in a frame[200]."
