13,Summary,"Thespesia populnea, otherwise known as Portia Tree, Eden Apple, Pacific Rosewood, or Indian Tulip Tree, is a flowering species belonging in the Malvaceae family. It is a small tree or shrub reaching a height of about 10 m and up to 60 cm in trunk diameter upon maturity. It is fast-growing and its bole is short and often crooked. The leaves are thin, bluish green, and broadly heart-shaped. The flowers are yellow, bell-shaped, and occur singly. Fruits are rounded capsules. The root is toxic. Fully established plants are highly tolerant to drought, strong winds, and saline conditions. Such characteristics make this species suitable for coastal erosion control. Young leaves, flowers, and flower buds can be eaten raw or cooked. The fruits are preserved and eaten. Unripe fruits are eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable. Plant parts of Portia tree, particularly the bark, root, leaves, flowers, and fruits, are all used in traditional medicine against a wide range of conditions like pleurisy, cholera, colic, fevers, herpes, urinary tract problems, abdominal swellings, hair lice, swollen testicles, rheumatism, coughs, influenza, headaches, skin diseases, hemorrhoids, colds, etc. The bark is a source of tannins. It also yields a strong fiber used for cordage, fishing lines, coffee bags, and for caulking boats. Seed oil can be used in lamps. The wood, fruits, flowers, and leaves all yield dye. Fruits, flowers, and bark also yield gums. The leaves are used as food wrapper. The wood is highly valued for light construction, flooring moulds, musical instruments, utensils, vehicle bodies, boat building, fuel, etc."

23,Other Uses Description,"Seaside tree. Small shade tree. Coastal screening. Hedging, Xerophytic. Agroforestry Uses: The tree is valuable as a coastal windbreak because it is highly resistant to wind and salt spray and grows well in sandy, saline soils[312 ]. Because of this tolerance of saline conditions, the plant is suitable for coastal erosion control, and is planted for this purpose, often as a living fence, in Karnataka, India and the Pacifci Islands[299 , 303 , 310 ]. It has been planted to provide support for vanilla plants[299 ]. Chippings of the plant have been tried as a green manure[310 ]. Other Uses The tough, fibrous bark yields a strong fibre used for cordage, fishing lines, coffee bags and for caulking boats[299 , 303 , 307 , 310 ] An oil is obtained from the seed[307 ]. It can be used in lamps[299 ]. The wood, soaked in water, yields a solution that is used in Asia to dye wool deep brown[299 , 307 , 310 ]. The fruit and flowers yield a water-soluble yellowish dye[299 , 307 , 310 ]. A black dye can be obtained from the leaves[299 ]. The bark is a source of tannins[299 , 303 ]. A gum is obtained from the fruit and flowers[303 , 307 ]. A thick gum, which is not soluble in water, is obtained from the bark[299 ]. The leaves are used for wrapping food[299 ]. The heartwood is reddish brown to dark brown or black, often with purple veining; it is sharply demarcated from the 1 - 2cm wide band of white to pale yellow or pale pink sapwood that darkens upon exposure. The wood is fine-grained; medium to fine-textured; it shows slight ribbon figure on quartersawn faces. Freshly cut wood has a rose-like smell. The wood is strong, hard, light to medium in weight; very durable, even when in contact with water or the ground, and resistant to insect attack. It seasons well, and does not warp or check; shrinkage upon seasoning is very low to low. The wood is easy to saw and work, despite its wavy grain; it turns well in both green and dry conditions; can be finished to an attractive polish; paints well; gluing properties are poor to medium. The wood contains an oil which slows down drying of varnishes. A very handsome and valuable wood, looking somewhat like chocolate and vanilla swirled togethe, it is used for a wide range of purposes where quality is more important than size, including traditional bowls, artefacts, gunstocks, jewellery, furniture, plates and utensils, horse-drawn carts and wheelbarrows, to carve canoe paddles. It is also used for light construction, flooring moulds, musical instruments, utensils and vehicle bodies[303 , 307 , 312 ]. Since it is very durable under water, it is popular for boat building[46 , 307 ]. The wood is used for fuel[299 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Portia tree is a plant of the moist to wet, lowland tropics and warm subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 150 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30°c, but can tolerate 10 - 35°c[418 ]. The plant can survive temperatures down to about 4°c[418 ] and the occasional very light frost[299 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 800 - 5,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a moisture-retentive but well-drained soil and a position in full sun[307 ]. It also succeeds in dry locations and is highly tolerant of saline conditions[303 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 8, tolerating 6 - 8.5[418 ]. Established plants are very drought resistant and can tolerate a dry season of up to 8 months[299 , 307 ]. Tolerant of occasional, short-lived inundation[299 ]. Plants are very wind-tolerant, withstanding even salt-laden winds[307 ]. The plant produces its seeds in a waterproof capsule that can float for a considerable time in salt water without losing viability. Thus it has managed to spread to the coasts of most areas of the tropics[307 ]. It has the potential to become a weed in new areas, so should not be introduced to areas outside its current range[312 ]. This species is often eradicated when found growing in cotton-producing areas, since it harbours the cotton-stainer beetle (Dysdercus spp.) which is a pest of the cotton plant[307 ]. Growth in height is rapid in the first few years, averaging 50 - 150cm per year, but it slows down when the tree is 7 - 10 years old. Stem diameter growth is 1 - 3cm per year[299 ]. Flowering can begin when the tree is only 1 - 2 years old[299 ]. In equatorial climates the plant will often flower all year round[299 ]. Flowering Time: Late Spring/Early Summer. Bloom Color: Coral/Apricot Maroon (Purple-Brown)."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - generally easy, although direct sowings are generally a failure[303 ]. Germination can be difficult due to the hard seed coat, and is improved by scarification with a knife or sandpaper[299 ]. Germination takes 8 - 70 days[299 ]. Pot the seedlings up as soon as they are large enough to handle, planting them in pots deep enough to accomodate the taproot. Plants should be ready to plant out in 12 - 16 weeks[299 ]. Raising from seed is preferred as then the timber is knot free, straight, even grained and tough[303 ]. Cuttings of all sizes strike well, but it is preferable to plant small cuttings as trees raised from large cuttings are said to be short lived and liable to decay[303 ]."
