Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Weeping.","Larix x marschlinsii is a deciduous Tree growing to 50 m (164ft 1in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Larix x. eurolepis.

A fast growing, wind-resistant tree, it can be used in shelterbelts.  - strong, heavy and durable[229].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Prefers an open airy position in a light or gravelly well-drained soil[200]. Plants are intolerant of badly drained soils, but they tolerate acid and infertile soils[200]. Succeeds on rocky hill or mountain sides and slopes[200]. A north or east aspect is more suitable than west or south[1]. This species is very cold-hardy when fully dormant, but the trees can be excited into premature growth in Britain by mild spells during the winter and they are then very subject to damage by late frosts and cold winds[1]. This is a very fast growing hybrid, it is often planted as a timber crop[185]. Young plants can put on 1.5 metres of growth a year, whilst some trees have been 16 metres tall in 15 years from seed[185]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Open ground plants, 1 year x 1 year are the best for planting out, do not use container grown plants with spiralled roots[200]. Plants transplant well, even when coming into growth in the spring[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - sow late winter in pots in a cold frame. One months cold stratification helps germination[113]. It is best to give the seedlings light shade for the first year[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots. Although only a few centimetres tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer providing you give them an effective weed-excluding mulch and preferably some winter protection for their first year. Otherwise grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year. The seed remains viable for 3 years[113]. This species is a hybrid so seed will not come true to type. If you are growing larger quantities of plants, you can sow the seed in an outdoor seedbed in late winter. Grow on the seedlings in the seedbed for a couple of years until they are ready to go into their permanent positions then plant them out during the winter.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
