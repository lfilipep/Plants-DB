22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a cool lime-free well-drained friable soil[1]. Plants are usually calcicole and require an acid soil[50]. Survives in any well-fed and well-drained soil in sun or part shade according to one report which also says that it is a reliable plant in most parts of the country[182]. This species is not very hardy outside the mildest areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188]. The flowers have a clove-like perfume[245]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame."
