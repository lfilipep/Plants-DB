See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Corynabutilon ochsenii. Anoda ochsenii. Phil.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Flowers: ,,"Flowers - raw[K]. The flowers are up to 5cm in diameter[219], they have a mild, slightly sweet flavour and a slightly mucilaginous texture[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a sunny position or part day shade in a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. This species is only hardy in the mildest areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to between -5 to -10°c when given the protection of a south or south-west facing wall[11, 184, 200]. Plants are often deciduous in cold winters[219]. A deep mulch in winter and tying in growth to the wall will maximise protection in winter[200]. If the plant is cut back by cold weather, it will normally resprout from the base in the spring and can flower on the current year's growth[202]. Plants tend to be short-lived in Britain, dying suddenly without any apparent cause. This is probably because they flower so profusely that they die of exhaustion[11]. They produce an abundance of fertile seed, however, and this normally breeds true to type, though it will hybridise with the closely related A. vitifolium if this species is nearby[11]. Dead-heading plants to prevent seeding can enhance longevity[200]. This species is closely related to A. vitifolium[11]. Tip-prune young plants to promote a bushy habit, older plants can be cut back hard annually in spring if required[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Germination should take place within a few weeks. Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow them on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of young shoots, June in a frame[200]. Grow on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].
