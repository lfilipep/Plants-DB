24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position or part day shade in a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Dislikes drought[200]. This species is only hardy in the mildest areas of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to between -5 to -10°c when given the protection of a south or south-west facing wall[11, 184, 200]. Plants are often deciduous in cold winters[219]. A deep mulch in winter and tying in growth to the wall will maximise protection in winter[200]. If the plant is cut back by cold weather, it will normally resprout from the base in the spring and can flower on the current year's growth[202]. Plants tend to be short-lived in Britain, dying suddenly without any apparent cause. This is probably because they flower so profusely that they die of exhaustion[11]. They produce an abundance of fertile seed, however, and this normally breeds true to type, though it will hybridise with the closely related A. vitifolium if this species is nearby[11]. Dead-heading plants to prevent seeding can enhance longevity[200]. This species is closely related to A. vitifolium[11]. Tip-prune young plants to promote a bushy habit, older plants can be cut back hard annually in spring if required[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Germination should take place within a few weeks. Once the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow them on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of young shoots, June in a frame[200]. Grow on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Grow on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant out in spring after the last expected frosts.",
