Main Bloom Time: Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect.","Berberis darwinii is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3.5 m (11ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked and used in preserves[2, 3, 105, 183]. An acid but very pleasant flavour, children seem particularly fond of the fruit[2, K]. When fully ripe, the fruit loses most of its acidity and makes very pleasant eating[K]. Unfortunately there is a lot of seed compared to the amount of flesh and this does detract somewhat from the pleasure of eating it[K]. The fruit goes very well raw in a muesli or cooked in a porridge[K]. The fruits are about 7mm long[200].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  Dysentery  Tonic  UrinaryThe root bark is tonic[46, 61]. Berberine, universally present in all parts of Berberis species but especially the rhizomes, has marked antibacterial effects, especially upon the urinary system. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","Plants are very amenable to trimming and can be used as a formal hedge. They also make a very good informal hedge, their long arching branches looking especially attractive when in flower or bearing fruit. The plants tolerate maritime exposure though they are slow growing[75]. A yellow dye is obtained from the root and bark[46, 61].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Erosion control, Pest tolerant, Hedge, Massing, Seashore. Prefers a warm moist loamy soil in full sun or light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds on chalky soils if other conditions are suitable but prefers an acid soil[184]. Dislikes exposure to strong winds according to one report[11], whilst others say that it is a very wind hardy plant, tolerating maritime exposure[49, 75, 200]. Does not flower well in exposed positions[49]. Plants growing in a very exposed position on our trial grounds in Cornwall are flowering and fruiting well, they are rather slow growing but are looking very happy and healthy[K]. A very ornamental plant, it is hardy to about -15°c[184]. A good bee plant[108]. Birds love this fruit and will happily eat it all before it is fully ripe[K]. If you want to experience the fully ripe fruit then it might be necessary to find ways of keep the birds off the plants[K]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely, they resprout well from the base[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
