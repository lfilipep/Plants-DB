The texture is fine; the grain straight; when seasoned it is without distinctive odour or taste[378 ]. The wood is reported to be hard, tough, and strong, there are mixed reports on durability with some saying the heartwood is never attacked by insects, whilst others say that it is susceptible to termite and fungus attack[378 ]. The timber is also reported to be resistant to shock, stress, compression, and tension, and is difficult to split or twist. Its elasticity is also reported as fairly good[378 ]. The wood works easily and well, but does not take nails or screws well[378 ]. The wood is prized for flooring because of it's stability and the variety of colours present in the heartwood; it is also used extensively in small boat construction and in the hulls of fishing canoes. Other uses include marquetry, interior finish, gunstocks, and furniture[378 ].",
