13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Dactylis glomerata is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Homegarden: Tropical multistrata agroforestry (multi-story combinations of trees, crops, domestic animals in the homestead).,Other Systems: Multistrata: Multistrata agroforests feature multiple layers of trees often with herbaceous perennials, annual crops, and livestock.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.MiscellanyReported to be oestrogenic. the plant is a folk remedy for treating tumours, kidney and bladder ailments"
22,Other Uses,"Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents."
23,Other Uses Description,"Environmental:Erosion control or dune stabilization,     Land reclamation,     Revegetation,     Soil conservation. Plants form impenetrably dense clumps and when planted close together in drifts make an excellent ground cover[200]. Having a deep root system, the plant is also useful for checking soil erosion[269]. The plant can be grown for biomass, annual productivity ranges from 2 to 37 tonnes per hectare[269]. If soil fertility is low, a large portion of the total production occurs in the spring, but if the soil is highly fertile, production is well distributed throughout the growing season[269]. Animal feed, fodder, forage."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most good soils and also under the shade of trees[1, 115, 162]. Prefers a light well-drained soil, it does not thrive on heavy or poorly drained soils[200]. Plants tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 31 to 176cm, an annual temperature range of 4.3 to 23.8°C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2[269]. The plant is adapted to humid temperate climates. It grows on almost any type of soil, but thrives best on heavier types, such as clays and clay loams. A drought-resistant plant, it will withstand high temperatures. Prefers areas with 480-750 mm annual rainfall, but will produce on rather poor dry soils[269]. Plants are hardy in all parts of Britain, though they are less winter-hardy than Phleum pratense or Bromus inermis and do not extend as far north in Europe[269]. A very variable plant[1]. There are both diploid and triploid forms[274]. Numerous strains have been developed, some coarse and stemmy, others good for hay and early grazing. Local ecotypes in the Mediterranean region are adapted to long hot dry summers. In Europe two types have been developed, one for pasture and one for hay. Pasture types produce more basal leaves and generally are more spreading than the hay types. Selections made in Canada, Sweden and Finland are improved for winter hardiness. Improved strains are more leafy, persistent and later flowering than unimproved commercial types[269]. An important food plant for the caterpillars of several lepidoptera species[30]. The plant is occasionally grown for lawns and is particularly well adapted for growing under shade[269]. However, this species does not make a good lawn grass because it is too coarse[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a cold frame in the spring and do not allow the compost to dry out[162]. Germination should take place within three weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. There is between 725,000 and 1,450,000 seeds per kilo[269]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown outdoors in situ in the spring. Division in spring[162]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
