19,Edible Uses Description,Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. A minor or regional crop in production with low or unreported yields  [1-1]. A number of Pennisetum species have edible seeds - no detailed information could be found for this species.

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds. Fountain grass is well adapted to fire and fires may contribute to fountain grass spread. Fountain grass is of little grazing value due to its coarse rough leaves. A popular ornamental."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbClimate: warm temperate to subtropical, Mediterranean. Humidity: semi-arid. Light: Sun to Partial Shade. Soil pH requirements: 6.1 (mildly acidic) to 7.8 (mildly alkaline). It grows in most soils, even poorly drained soils preferring exposed, dry habitats, particularly rocky areas but can also grow in sandy soils such as coastal grasslands. It is drought-tolerant and fast growing. Becomes facultativlely inactive with extended drought, freezing, or near-freezing temperatures. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,Plants can be grown from cuttings.  It can also be grown by seeds or division of the clump. This is a very easy grass to propagate.
