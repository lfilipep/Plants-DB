13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Nannorrhops ritchiana is an evergreen Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Little is known about this species cultural requirements, but it probably succeeds in most fertile moist but well-drained soils in a sheltered sunny position[231]. Plants experience very cold winters in their native habitat, though this is accompanied by heavy snow which acts to insulate the plant from the extremes of cold. However, this species should be suitable for cultivation in temperate areas that only experience light frosts[231]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. Palms can also often be transplanted even when very large. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse at not less than 24°c[188]. Stored seed is very slow to germinate. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water prior to sowing may shorten the germination time. Plants form a long tap-root some time before forming a shoot and so should be sown in fairly deep pots. Germination of fresh seed usually takes place in 3 - 4 months at 25°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
