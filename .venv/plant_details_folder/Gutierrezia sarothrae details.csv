18,Edible Uses,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil)."

The roots have been placed in boiling water and the steam inhaled in the treatment of respiratory complaints[257]. The flowers are laxative[257]. A decoction of the fresh flowers has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257]. The leaves are cathartic, febrifuge and sedative[257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of coughs and colds[257]. It has also been used as a bath to treat fevers and sores, including those caused by venereal diseases[257]. A poultice of the moistened leaves has been used to treat bruises, wounds, sprains, nose bleeds and insect stings[257]. A protein in the plant is reported to have anti-cancer activity[274]. A strong, black infusion of the plant has been used as a rub on rheumatic joints[257]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a position in full sun in a deep open well-drained soil[200]. Often found in calcareous soils in the wild[274]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants are sub-shrubs and may die back to the base in winter[200]. Plants have deep taproots and resent root disturbance[200]. They should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible. Because it is unpalatable to livestock, this plant is often an indicator of overgrazed land[274]. Plants are strongly aromatic[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick the plants out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, using deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Grow on for the first winter in a greenhouse and plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame."
