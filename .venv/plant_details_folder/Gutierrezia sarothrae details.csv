Plants are sub-shrubs and may die back to the base in winter[200]. Plants have deep taproots and resent root disturbance[200]. They should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible. Because it is unpalatable to livestock, this plant is often an indicator of overgrazed land[274]. Plants are strongly aromatic[200].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick the plants out into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, using deep pots to accommodate the tap root.
