The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw[2, 46, 61]. Insipid according to one report[200], whilst another says that it is rather bitter[105]. Said to have a banana-lime flavour and often sold in speciality stores in Europe and America, the fruit is not considered to be very desirable in its native area and it is only eaten in times of scarcity[183]. Seed - raw[57, 86]. Rich in oil with a nutty flavour but very fiddly to use because the seed is small and covered with a fibrous coat[K]. Leaves - cooked[177, 183].",Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is then necessary to take a purge in order to expel the tapeworms or other parasites from the body[7].",Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,"Used as a rootstock for C. sativus, conferring disease resistance[183]. Since this species is less cold tolerant than C, sativus, it is probably not suitable as a rootstock in cool temperate areas.",,"Requires a rich, well-drained moisture retentive soil and a very warm, sunny sheltered position[200]. A frost-tender plant, the horned cucumber is frequently cultivated for its fruit in tropical and sub-tropical climates, there are some named varieties. It requires a hotter summer than is normally experienced in Britain in order to produce a worthwhile crop and is generally best grown in a greenhouse in this country[61, 200].","Seed - sow early to mid spring in a greenhouse in a rich soil. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Sow 2 or 3 seeds per pot and thin out to the best plant. Grow them on fast and plant out after the last expected frosts, giving them cloche or frame protection for at least their first few weeks if you are trying them outdoors.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
