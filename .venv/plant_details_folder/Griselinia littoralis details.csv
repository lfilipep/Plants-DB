It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

23,Other Uses Description,"Grows well by the sea, making a good hedge that tolerates maritime exposure[11, 29, 49]. Plants are very amenable to trimming[200], they are best cut in early summer[188] and can be cut right back into old wood if required. A slow-growing plant, but it makes a nice dense hedge[K].  - very durable, firm, dense but slightly brittle. Used for ship building, railway sleepers etc[46, 61, 123].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich light loam in sun or semi-shade[200]. Tolerates chalky soils[11]. Plants are very tolerant of strong maritime winds[182] but they can be damaged by cold dry winds. Tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c, this species is somewhat tender in most parts of Britain[11] though it usually regrows if cut back by frost[200]. The young shoots in spring are often cut back by late frosts[K]. Very tolerant of root disturbance, it transplants well even when quite large though it would then require staking at first when growing in exposed positions[166]. A number of cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value[182, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. It self-sows abundantly in the milder areas of Britain if both sexes are grown[11].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a greenhouse. It can also be sown in the spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts and give some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 7 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Keep the foliage moist. Pot up in August and overwinter in a sheltered position, planting out in late spring after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 7 - 10 cm with a heel, October/November in a frame. High percentage[78].",
