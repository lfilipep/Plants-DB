17,Edible Uses Description,"The following report is for Z. americanum, it is probably also applicable to this species[K]. Seed - used as a condiment. A pepper substitute[106]. The fruit is rather small, about 4 - 5m in diameter[229], but is produced in dense clusters which makes harvesting easy[K]. Each fruit contains a single seed[229]."
18,Medicinal Uses,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Irritant: Causes irritation or abnormal sensitivity in living tissue.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being."
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antispasmodic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Irritant  Odontalgic  StimulantThis species is quite widely used in herbal medicine, it has the same properties as Z. americanum, but is said to be more active[4]. All parts of the plant, but especially the bark and roots, contain the aromatic bitter oil xanthoxylin[4]. This has a number of applications in medicine[4]. The fruit has a similar medicinal action to the bark[4]. The bark and roots are irritant, odontalgic and antirheumatic[213]. Along with the fruit they are diaphoretic, stimulant and a useful tonic in debilitated conditions of the stomach and digestive organs[4]. They produce arterial excitement and are of use in the treatment of fevers, ague, poor circulation etc[4]. The fruits are considered more active than the bark, they are also antispasmodic, carminative, diuretic and antirheumatic[4, 213, 222]. The pulverized root and bark are used to ease the pain of toothache[213, 222]. One report says that it is very efficacious, but the sensation of the acrid bark is fully as unpleasant as the toothache[213]. Chewing the bark induces copious salivation[222]. Rubbing the fruit against the skin, especially on the lips or in the mouth, produces a temporary loss of sensation[K]. A tea or tincture of the bark has been used in the treatment of rheumatism, dyspepsia, dysentery, heart and kidney troubles etc[222]. A tea made from the inner bark has been used to treat itchy skin[213]."

22,Cultivation Details,

Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The leaves are often persistent until the following spring when the new leaves are produced[82]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Flowers are formed on the old wood[206].  Special Features:North American native, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Stored seed may requires up to 3 months cold stratification, though scarification may also help[113]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. Germination should take place in late spring, though it might take another 12 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Root cuttings, 3cm long, planted horizontally in pots in a greenhouse. Good percentage[78]. Suckers, removed in late winter and planted into their permanent positions[113]."
