21,Other Uses Description,"An admirable dense ground cover plant[182, 208], though it might need weeding for the first year[197]. It can be clipped in spring to give denser growth[197, 208]. Plants should be spaced about 60cm apart each way[208]. Plants can be grown as a low hedge, the cultivar 'Furzey' is often used[29].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen. Requires a light loam[11]. This species tolerates lime in the soil[182, 188] so long as there is plenty of humus[208]. Grows best in a poor soil. Resents dry soils. Prefers an open situation. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[182]. Plants are quite fast growing[1]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a sandy compost in a cold frame in spring. Keep moist. Prick out the plants as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them in their permanent positions when they are 5 - 8cm tall[11]. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 3cm long taken from twiggy lateral growths near the base of the plant, July/August in a frame. Remove the leaves from the bottom part of the stem without causing any damage to the bark. The cuttings root in a few weeks if they are given some bottom heat. Plant out in spring[11]. Layering in spring or autumn. Plants can be 'dropped' and then dug up and divided about 6 - 12 months later. Dropping involves digging up the plant and then replanting it about 15 - 20cm deeper in the soil to encourage roots to form along the stems[78].",
