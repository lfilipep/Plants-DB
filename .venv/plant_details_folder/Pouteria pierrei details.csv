It is often buttressed and grows about 40 m tall and 1.2 m across. It has a dense crown and straight cylindrical bole. The leaves are oval and with hairs underneath. The flowers are in clusters. The fruits are red and globose with fine hairs comprising of oval seeds. The fruit pulp is edible. The bark is a source of latex which has no known use to date. The wood is used for high quality sliced veneer, light carpentry, interior joinery, furniture, moulding.","Pouteria pierrei is a deciduous Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Aningeria pierrei (A.Chev.) Aubr?v. & Pellegr. Aningeria robusta (A.Chev.) Aubr?v. & Pellegr. Hormog,,Fruit: ,,Fruit - raw. The pulp is eaten[299 ]. The red fruit is a globose berry 15 - 20mm lcontaining a single large seed[299 ].,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

No uses are recorded. The heartwood is creamy white to pale pinkish brown; it is indistinctly demarcated from the 3 - 6cm wide band of sapwood. The grain is straight, sometimes slightly interlocked; texture fine; the wood lustrous. It is moderately light, not durable and liable to attacks by fungi, termites and dry-wood borers. Drying usually does not cause problems, but there is a slight risk of distortion and checking and a tendency to blue stain, especially in early stages of air drying. Once dry, the wood is moderately stable in service. The wood contains about 0.3% silica and consequently the blunting effect on saws and cutting tools is high. Stellite-tipped sawteeth and tungsten-carbide tools are recommended. Nailing and screwing properties are good; the wood stains, paints and glues well; slicing properties are good, and excellent veneer can be produced. The wood is especially recommended for high-quality sliced veneer. It is also used for light carpentry, interior joinery, high-class furniture and moulding[299 ].",,"The tree usually regenerates abundantly in the wild[299 ]. The plant is susceptible to fire; after a fire in a forest in Côte d'Ivoire 50% of the trees died within 6 years[299 ]. Seedlings are classified as non-pioneer light demanders. Although they may be very abundant around parent trees, further development depends on the presence of gaps in the forest canopy[299 ].","Seed - Germination takes 2-3 weeks, and initial growth is slow[299 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
