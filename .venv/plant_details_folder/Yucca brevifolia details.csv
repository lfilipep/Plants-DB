1,Common Name,"Joshua Tree, Jaeger's Joshua tree, Yucca, Joshua Tree",
2,Family,Agavaceae,
3,USDA hardiness,9-11,
4,Known Hazards,"The roots contain saponins[222]. Whilst saponins are quite toxic to people, they are poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass straight through. They are also destroyed by prolonged heat, such as slow baking in an oven. Saponins are found in many common foods such as beans[K]. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",

14,Physical Characteristics,"Yucca brevifolia is an evergreen Tree growing to 9 m (29ft 6in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Flowers - cooked[257]. The flower buds, before opening, can be parboiled in salt water to remove the bitterness, drained and then cooked again and served like cauliflower[183]. The opened flowers are rich in sugar and can be roasted and eaten as candy[183]. Fruit - cooked[257]. The fruits can be roasted then formed into cakes and dried for later use[257]. Root - raw, boiled or roasted[183]. Seed[183]. Gathered and eaten by the local Indians[82]. No further details are given, but it is probably ground into a powder and mixed with cornmeal or other flours and used for making bread, cakes etc. Immature seedpod[257]. No more details given.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Brush: Used for cleaning clothes, as a paintbrush etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making ropes, baskets, sandals, clothing and mats[82, 257]. The whole leaf can be woven into mats etc and it can also be used as a paint brush[82, 257]. The dark red core of the roots has been used as a pattern material in coiled baskets[257]. The core is split into strands, soaked and worked in with the coiling so that the colour is always on the outside[257]. Red and black dyes have been obtained from the roots[257]. The roots are rich in saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[21, 85]. It makes a good hair wash[85, 94]. Wood - light, soft, spongy, difficult to work[82]. Sometimes cut into thin layers and used as wrapping material, or manufactured into boxes and other small articles[82].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen. Thrives in any soil but prefers a sandy loam and full exposure to the south[11]. Plants are hardier when they are grown on poor sandy soils[200]. Prefers a hot dry position[166], disliking heavy rain[3]. Established plants are very drought resistant[11]. The flowers of this species are malodorous[200]. In the plants native environment, its flowers can only be pollinated by a certain species of moth. This moth cannot live in Britain and, if fruit and seed is required, hand pollination is necessary. This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. Individual crowns are monocarpic, dying after flowering[233]. However, the crown will usually produce a number of sideshoots before it dies and these will grow on to flower in later years[233]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].  Special Features:North American native, Not North American native, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. It usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some winter protection for at least their first winter outdoors - a simple pane of glass is usually sufficient[K].. Seed is not produced in Britain unless the flowers are hand pollinated. Root cuttings in late winter or early spring. Lift in April/May and remove small buds from base of stem and rhizomes. Dip in dry wood ashes to stop any bleeding and plant in a sandy soil in pots in a greenhouse until established[78]. Division of suckers in late spring[3]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.,
