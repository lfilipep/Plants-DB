13,Summary,"African Yam Bean, Sphenostylis stenocarpa, is a tropical, fast-growing climbing vine growing up to 2 m in height from a tuberous rootstock. Its leaves are comprised of three leaflets each of 14 cm long and 5 cm wide. The flowers can be pink, purple, or greenish-white, occurring in the axils of the leaves. Seed pods are flat and smooth. This species has no medicinal uses. However, it is cultivated as food source particularly for its pods and roots. Immature seedpods and the seeds are cooked and used as a vegetable. The roots, high in protein, can also be consumed either raw or cooked. Similarly, the leaves are also cooked and consumed as a vegetable. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria that form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen.",
14,Physical Characteristics,Sphenostylis stenocarpa is a PERENNIAL CLIMBER growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.,

19,Edible Uses Description,"Immature seedpods - cooked and used as a vegetable[300 ]. The pods are up to 25cm long and 15mm wide[300 ]. Seeds - cooked[300 ]. Rich in protein, they are boiled and eaten as a vegetable, or added to soups etc[301 ]. The seed is about 9mm long[300 ]. Root - raw or cooked[300 ]. The white fleshed roots can be cooked like potatoes, which they resemble in taste[301 ]. They are rich in protein[301 ]. Leaves - cooked and used as a vegetable[300 ].",

22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria that form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen.,
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: ProteinA plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 29°c, but can tolerate 15 - 35°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,200mm, but tolerates 800 - 1,400mm[418 ]. Requires a dry period when flowering[300 ]. Prefers a position in full sun[418 ]. Grows best in a fertile, sandy soil[300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 7[418 ]. Although perennial, the plant is usually treated as an annual in cultivation[418 ]. Harvesting of the seedpods can commence about 5 months after sowing, and continue for another 2 months[300 ]. Tubers mature 7 - 8 months after sowing[300 ]. Optimum yields of the seed is 2 tonnes per hectare, and of the tubers 4 tonnes[418 ]. Plants are probably day length sensitive[300 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ[300 ]. Division of tubers[300 ].,
