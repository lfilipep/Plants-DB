It was for a time an officinal American medicinal plant[4], but is little, if at all, used in modern herbalism. The root is emetic and odontalgic[61, 257]. An infusion has been used in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints, stomach aches etc[257]. The pulped root is placed in the tooth cavity or on the gum in order to bring relief from toothache[207]. A decoction of the root has been used as ear drops to treat earaches[257].

Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division, best done after flowering. Another report says that it is best done in spring or early autumn[187]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well.
