13,Summary,"A native to Mexico and Central America, Pouteria sapota or commonly known as Mamey Sapote is a popular fruit tree that is now cultivated throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and South Florida. It is a large species, growing about 15-45 m tall. Main propagation is through grafting to preserve the characteristics of the parent plant and for faster growth. The fruit is eaten raw and made into desserts and drinks. It is ovoid in shape with sweet almond-like flavor. The seeds are milled to prepare a bitter chocolate. Medicinally, seed oil is used as skin ointment, for preventing hair fall, and as a sedative in ear and eye ailments while the seeds itself is used for digestive problems, coronary troubles, and epilepsy. Milky sap is used to remove warts and fungal growths on skin. Seed oil is also used in soap, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. The wood is used for cabinet making, furniture, carts, shelves, and house frames.",

In 1970, clinical tests at the University of California at Los Angeles failed to reveal any hair-growth promoting activity but confirmed that the oil of sapote seed is effective in stopping hair-fall caused by seborrhoeic dermatitis[303 ]. The oil is said to be diuretic and is also employed as a sedative in eye and ear ailments[303 ]. The seed residue, after oil extraction, is applied as a poultice on painful skin afflictions[303 ]. The seed kernel is regarded as a digestive[303 ]. A seed infusion is used as an eyewash[303 ]. The pulverized seed coat is reported to be a remedy for coronary trouble and, taken with wine, is said to be helpful against kidney stones and rheumatism[303 ]. The Aztecs employed it against epilepsy[303 ]. The bark is bitter and astringent and contains lucumin, a cyanogenic glycoside[303 ]. A decoction of the bark is taken as a pectoral. A tea of the bark and leaves is administered in arteriosclerosis and hypertension[303 ]. The milky sap is emetic and anthelmintic and has been used to remove warts and fungal growths on the skin[303 ]",

23,Other Uses Description,"Large shade tree. Public open space. Specimen. Backyard tree. Other Uses: It has been used to fix the colours on painted gourds and other articles of handicraft[303 ]. (The part used is not specified[K ].) The seed kernel yields 45 to 60% of a white, semi-solid, vaseline-like oil which is edible when freshly extracted and refined. It is sometimes used in soap and considered to have a greater potential in the soap industry, in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products[303 ]. It is also used as a hair dressing, and is said to promote the growth of the hair and prevent it falling out[331 ]. The very smooth seeds were formerly much used in Central America for smoothing starched linen, like an iron, and it is stated that they are still used for this purpose in Guatemala[331 ]. The trees are seldom cut for timber, unless they bear poor quality fruit[303 ]. There is very little sapwood. The heartwood is buff or brown when fresh, becoming reddish with age; sometimes resembles mahogany but is redder and more or less mottled with darker tones. It is fine-grained, compact, generally hard and fairly heavy, strong, easy to work and fairly durable. It is rated as suitable for cabinetwork and is made into furniture, but mostly serves for building carts, and for shelving and house frames[303 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"It can succeed in the lowland moist tropics or subtropics up to elevations of 1,400 metres[303 ]. In its native range, the average temperature ranges between 25 and 28°c, though good yields and fruit quality can be obtained at temperatures between 30 and 33°c[303 ]. It is very intolerant of low temperatures, being quickly damaged or killed if temperatures drop much below 2°c[303 ]. It grows well in areas where the mean annual rainfall varies from 800 - 2,500mm[303 ]. It is very susceptible to drought[200 ]. It grows well in maritime areas, where it shows good wind resistance[200 ]. Prefers a rich, deep, moist soil and a position in full sun[307 ]. Tolerant of a wide range of soil types, including sandy and clay soils[200 ]. Requires a very well-drained soil[200 ]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5 - 7[200 ]. Seedling trees begin to bear fruit after 7 years or longer, whilst grafted trees begin to bear in 3 to 5 years[303 ]. It takes from 13 - 24 months for fruit to reach maturity and so trees may have flowers, immature fruit and mature fruit all at the same time[303 ]. The sapote is a very prolific cropper, mature trees may bear 200 to 500 fruit per year, whilst twice this amount may be obtained from large trees[303 ]. There are some named varieties[200 , 301 ]. Bloom Color: Pale Yellow White/Near White. Spacing: 30-40 ft. (9-12 m).",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - remove it from its husk before sowing[200 ]. The seed has a short viability of only 7 - 14 days[303 ]. Seeds should be collected from mature fruit and planted immediately in well-drained media[303 ]. Seeds which have a hairline crack in the seed coat appear to germinate more quickly[303 ]. Side-grafting. Air-layering may be possible[200 ].,
