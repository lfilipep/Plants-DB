22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained humus rich soil in partial shade in a position sheltered from cold drying winds[200]. We are not sure if this plant is hardy outdoors in Britain. One report says that it is hardy in zone 7 (tolerating temperatures down to between -10 and -15°c) but then goes on to suggest that it needs an essentially frost-free climate and is often grown as an indoor pot plant in Britain[200]. This species is closely related to A. pseudocrispa, from which it differs in having crenate leaves with a distinct marginal vein[266]. There has been some confusion between this species and A. crispa, the name Ardisia crispa was misapplied by de Candolle to Ardisia crenata[266].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Fragrant flowers."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best harvested when it is ripe in the winter and sown immediately in a greenhouse[1]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady part of the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, once the plants are 20cm or more tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood in summer[200]. Grow on in cool, shaded humid conditions until well rooted[200]."
