The root is the main part used and it can be prepared in four different ways - charcoaled, prepared (but no details of the preparation are given) when it is called Shu Di Huang and fresh or dried when it is called Sheng Di Huang[176]. The roots are antibacterial, antiseptic, cardiac, diuretic, febrifuge, haemostatic, hypoglycaemic and tonic[61, 176, 178, 218, 238, 279]. They are used in the treatment of a wide range of ailments, including anaemia, cancer, bleeding, constipation, coughs, fever and premature ejaculation[174, 176, 218, 238]. The charcoaled root is used to stop bleeding and tonify the spleen and stomach[176]. The fresh root is used to treat thirst, the rash of infectious diseases and bleeding due to pathological heat[176]. The dried root is used to treat bleeding due to blood deficiency and to nourish the vital essence[176]. The prepared root is used to treat dizziness and palpitations due to anaemia or blood deficiency, chronic tidal fever, night sweats, dry mouth, lumbago and nocturnal emissions[176]. The roots of cultivated plants are harvested in the autumn or early winter, whilst wild plants are harvested in early spring[238]. They can be used fresh or dried[238]. The root is an ingredient of 'Four Things Soup', the most widely used woman's tonic in China[254]. The other species used are Angelica sinensis, Ligusticum wallichii and Paeonia lactiflora[254]. The leaves are bruised and used in the treatment of scaly eczema or psoriasis[218].",,None known,,"Requires a light freely-draining humus-rich loam in light shade[200]. Prefers a neutral to acid sandy soil[238]. Requires a warm sunny position[188, 238]. This species is probably hardy to about -25°c if the plants are dry, but the softly hairy leaves are susceptible to rot in warm damp winters and so the plants are often grown in the greenhouse[187]. The plants are prone to fungal infections, especially when grown in damp conditions[238]. The Chinese foxglove is cultivated as a medicinal plant in China[238].",Seed - sow autumn or spring in a greenhouse[188]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Root cuttings in winter[200]. Division in spring[238]. Basal cuttings in late spring or early summer[200]. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
