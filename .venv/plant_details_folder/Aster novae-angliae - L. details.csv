0,Aster novae-angliae - L.,New England Aster,Asteraceae or Compositae,4-9,None known,Not known,Eastern N. America. Naturalized in several areas of Britain[17].,(0 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsterNovae-angliae.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsterNovae-angliae2.jpg","Bloom Color: Pink.Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer, Mid fall. Form: Upright or erect.","Aster novae-angliae is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Cultivated Beds;,None known,,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The root is analgesic, astringent, expectorant and febrifuge[257]. A poultice has been used in the treatment of pain, fevers and diarrhoea[257]. The ooze of the roots has been sniffed in the treatment of catarrh[257]. A decoction of the whole plant has been used in the treatment of all kinds of fevers and in the treatment of weak skin[257].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore. Succeeds in most good garden soils[1], preferring one that is well-drained and moisture retentive[200]. Prefers a sunny position[200], but it also succeeds in partial shade[233]. Prefers a rich soil[1], but tolerates poor ones[233]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[187]. A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants need to be divided every few years, preferably in the spring, in order to keep the plant vigorous[187]. Most species in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Attracts butterflies and moths, it is also a good bee plant providing nectar in autumn[30]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Pre-chilling the seed for two weeks can improve germination rates[134]. Germination usually takes place within 2 weeks at 20°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted straight into their permanent positions whist smaller clumps are best potted up and kept in a cold frame until they are growing away well. Basal cuttings in late spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
