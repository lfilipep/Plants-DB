23,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the warm tropical lowlands with low to high rainfall[335 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 18 - 28c, but can tolerate 12 - 34c[418 ]. It succeeds with a mean annual rainfall in the range 300 - 3,500mm[418 ]. Often an epiphytic plant, though it also grows on the ground. Requires a well-drained soil and a pH of 6 or lower[200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.3 - 6.7, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. Widely cultivated in the tropics and subtropics, it has often escaped from cultivation and become naturalised. It has been classified as 'invasive' in some areas, where it often spreads vegetatively[305 ]. Plants grow well, but do not always set fruit well, when growing in the wetter areas of the tropics[377 ]. They can have 4-6 fruiting cycles per year. Flowering Time: Late Summer/Early Fall. Bloom Color: Green White/Near White. Spacing: 12-15 in. (30-38 cm)."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - Stem cuttings. The cuttings are usually dried out for a week or two. The plants are self sterile and have to be pollinated by bats and moths. Hand pollination is recommended for good fruit production.
