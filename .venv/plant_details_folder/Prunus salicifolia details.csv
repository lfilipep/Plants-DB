0,Prunus salicifolia,"Capulin Cherry, Mexican Bird Cherry",Rosaceae,3-10,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",Not known,Southern N. America - Mexico to S. America - Peru.,(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage1.JPG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG","Bloom Color: White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval.","Prunus salicifolia is a deciduous Tree growing to 25 m (82ft 0in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from May to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",P. capollin. P. capuli.

Thin skinned with a juicy sub-acid to sweet flesh but a slightly astringent aftertaste[183, 196]. They can be eaten out of hand or used in preserves, pies etc[183]. The juice is often mixed with cornmeal to make a cake[46]. The fruit is about 17mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].  - hard, insect resistant. Used for furniture, musical instruments etc, It is also a good fuel[196].",,"Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Attractive flowers or blooms. Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil, growing well on limestone[11, 196, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much is present[1]. Plants are not exacting in their soil requirements, succeeding in poor soils and in clays[196]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Plants have tolerated temperatures down to about -22°c in Massachusetts, N. America[196]. This species is closely related to P. serotina, but it has larger edible fruits[11]. A fast growing and vigorous species, it can fruit in its third year from seed[196]. Trees have a very low chilling requirement and are adapted to grow in warm winter areas where true cherries are unable to fruit[183]. They are cultivated in C. America, from Mexico to Peru, for their edible fruit. There are some named varieties[183, 196]. 'Ecuadorian' has large sweet fruit and is a heavy cropper[200]. 'Fausto' has large sweet fruit and is a good cropper. 'Harriet' is a dwarf tree with large fruit[200]. 'Hauchi Grande' has large mild-flavoured fruit and is a very heavy cropper[200]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200].
