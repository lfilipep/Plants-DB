13,Summary,"A native species to Central and South America, Red Bark or Red Cinchona (Cinchona pubescens) is a usually 10 m tall deciduous tree with small, thick, and hairy branches known as an effective medicinal plant for malaria due to the quinine content of its bark. It is fast-growing and flowering starts 2 - 3 years after planting. The bark is a bitter, astringent, tonic herb and made into powder, tablets, liquid extracts and tinctures. It should be noted however that excessive use of such has various side effects like headache, rash, abdominal pain, deafness, and blindness. The quinine is also used in making hair oils, shampoo, and insecticide, and as a vulcanizing agent, and in the preparation of certain metals.",

20,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Astringent  Bitter  Cardiac  Febrifuge  Malaria  TonicRed bark has a long history of native use, especially as a treatment for fevers and malaria. Modern research has shown it to be a very effective treatment for fevers, and especially as a treatment and preventative of malaria. The bark contains various alkaloids, particularly quinine and quinidine. Up to 70 - 80% of the total alkaloids contained in the bark are quinine[ 418 ]. The bark is a bitter, astringent, tonic herb that lowers fevers, relaxes spasms, is antimalarial (the alkaloid quinine) and slows the heart (the alkaloid quinidine)[ 238 ]. The bark is made into various preparations, such as tablets, liquid extracts, tinctures and powders[ 238 ]. It is used internally in the treatment of malaria, neuralgia, muscle cramps and cardiac fibrillation[ 238 ]. It is an ingredient in various proprietary cold and influenza remedies[ 238 ]. The liquid extract is useful as a cure for drunkenness[ 418 ]. It is also used as a gargle to treat sore throats[ 238 ]. Care must be taken in the use of this herb since excess can cause a number of side effects including cinchonism, headache, rash, abdominal pain, deafness and blindness[ 238 ]. The herb, especially in the form of the extracted alkaloid quinine, is subject to legal restrictions in some countries[ 238 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: Low (2/5). The alkaloid quinine, extracted from the bark, is used in products like hair oils and shampoo, sun-tan oil, insecticides, as a vulcanizing agent in the rubber industry, and in the preparation of certain metals[ 418 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal: Most pharmaceuticals are synthesized from petroleum but 25% of modern medicines are based on plants.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Medicinal  Management: Coppice  Minor Global CropA plant of moderate elevations in the moist tropics, where it is found at elevations from 800 - 3,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 17 - 25°c, but can tolerate 9 - 28°c[ 418 ]. It can be killed by temperatures of 5°c or lower[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 2,500 - 3,500mm, but tolerates 1,400 - 4,000mm[ 418 ]. Requires a well-drained, moist soil and a position in full sun or partial shade[ 238 , 418 ]. It grows very poorly or not at all on soils that have been exposed to fire[ 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6, tolerating 4.5 - 6.5[ 418 ]. A fast-growing tree, the plants start flowering after 2 - 3 years, and are uprooted and harvested after 8 - 12 years[ 418 ]. In commercial plantations, the trees are coppiced when about 6 years old[ 238 ].",
