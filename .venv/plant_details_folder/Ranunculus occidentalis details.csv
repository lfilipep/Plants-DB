Many if not all plants in this genus also have a strongly acrid juice that can cause blistering to the skin[65, 183].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a moist loamy soil[1]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
