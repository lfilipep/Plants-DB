23,Other Uses Description,"A good medium high ground cover plant[200], it is a very good weed suppresser. Plants can be used as a low loose hedge[200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a good humus rich loam with ample moisture in the growing season[200]. Prefers partial shade, growing well in thin woodland. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -22°c. The leaf margins are damaged by even light frosts, this gives a distinctive white margin to the leaves but does not otherwise damage the plant[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The rhizome is gently running. The plant is very invasive but fairly easy to control.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - if possible, surface sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Stored seed is best sown as soon as it is received. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could be a few years. Plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division in late spring as new growth commences. Take large divisions, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main clump as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Divisions of less than 5 - 6 culms rarely succeed[200].",
