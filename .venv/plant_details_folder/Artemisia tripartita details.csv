25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a well-drained circumneutral or slightly alkaline loamy soil, preferring a sunny position[1, 200]. Succeeds in most soils including those of low fertility[164]. Plants are longer lived, more hardy and more aromatic when they are grown in a poor dry soil[245]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200]. Plants resprout freely after a fire[60, 164]. The sub-species A. tripartita rupicola is a dwarf form growing only 15cm tall, whilst A. tripartita tripartita grows to 1.8 metres[164]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow from late winter to early summer in a greenhouse in a very free-draining soil, but do not allow it to dry out. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 weeks in a warm greenhouse[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very slow to root[11] Division in spring or autumn. Layering[164].",
