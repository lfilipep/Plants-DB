Requires a well-drained soil, succeeding on dry barren sites[200]. Plants are tolerant of drought and atmospheric pollution[200]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. The branches are brittle and very liable to wind damage[200]. When plants are grown in rich soils they produce coarse and rank growth which is even more liable to wind damage[11, 200]. Any pruning should be done in late summer in order to reduce the risk of bleeding[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The flowers are fragrant[245]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",Seed - pre-soak for 48 hours in warm water and sow the seed in late winter in a cold frame[80]. A short stratification improves germination rates and time[80]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the following summer. The seed stores for over 10 years[113].
