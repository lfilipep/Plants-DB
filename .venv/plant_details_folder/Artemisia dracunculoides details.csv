Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Plants are longer lived, more hardy and more aromatic when they are grown in a poor dry soil[245]. Nomenclature is somewhat confused for this species. It is considered by some botanists to be a hardier form of A. dracunculus but with an inferior flavour[4, 200], whilst some consider it to be part of A. glauca[43]. It is very similar to A. dracunculus, but is more vigorous and hardier, Its leaves have a pungent and less pleasant flavour than that species[238]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Special Features:Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
