Prefers a neutral to alkaline soil[200]. This plant is probably not hardy in Britain[11]. Resents root disturbance[1]. The flowers abound in nectar and are much visited by bees[82]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","The seed can be sown in late winter in a cold frame[78] but would probably benefit from an earlier sowing if the seed can be obtained any sooner. Three months stratification at 5°c improves germination[200]. Germination rates are variable[78]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors.
