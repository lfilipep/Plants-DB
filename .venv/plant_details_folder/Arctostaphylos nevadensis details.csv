It would be easier to dry the whole fruit, grind this into a powder and use it in soups etc[K]. Fruit[92, 105, 161]. The fruit can be eaten fresh or dried and stored for later use[257]. It can also be pulverised and made into a drink[257].",

22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellowish-brown dye is obtained from the leaves, it does not require a mordant[168]. A good ground-cover plant for steep sandy banks[28, 200]. A carpeting plant, growing quite rapidly and rooting as it spreads[208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep moist well-drained light or medium lime-free loam in sun or semi-shade but plants produce less fruit when grown in the shade[200]. Prefers a position in full sun[11]. Grows well in shade[28]. Plants at Kew were growing very well in a shady position on a NE slope in 1990[K]. Grows well in a sandy seashore garden[208]. This species is closely related to A. uva-ursi[11, 60]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[134].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak dried seed in boiling water for 10 - 20 seconds or burn some straw on top of them and then stratify at 2 - 5°c for 2 months[11, 200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of side shoots of the current season's growth, 5 - 8cm with a heel, August to December in a frame. Takes one year[1, 78]. Division in early spring. Take care because the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and keep them in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing away actively. Layering in spring[200].",
