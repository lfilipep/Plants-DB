24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a dryish well-drained sandy loam and full sun[1, 200]. Heavy clay soils may induce winter rots[200]. Succeeds in poor soils. The flowers open in the evening, they are richly scented and are very attractive to moths. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a sandy medium in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots of low-fertility soil and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant out in the following spring.",
