13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Mentha pulegium is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.6 m (2ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"eaLeaves - raw or cooked[2, 9, 27]. Used as a flavouring in salads or cooked foods[183]. A spearmint-like flavour, though rather coarser, it is not used very often in Britain[4]. A herb tea is made from the fresh or dried leaves[183]. For drying, it should be harvested as the plant comes into flower[4]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Uterine tonic: A tonic for the uterus. See also oxytoxic."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Antispasmodic  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Eczema  Emmenagogue  Sedative  Stimulant  Uterine tonicPennyroyal has been used for centuries in herbal medicine. Its main value is as a digestive tonic where it increases the secretion of digestive juices and relieves flatulence and colic[254]. Pennyroyal also powerfully stimulates the uterine muscles and encourages menstruation, thus it should not be prescribed for pregnant women since it can procure abortions, this is especially the case if the essential oil is used[238, 254]. The herb is antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, sedative and stimulant[4, 9, 46, 165]. A tea made from the leaves has traditionally been used in the treatment of fevers, headaches, minor respiratory infections, digestive disorders, menstrual complaints and various minor ailments[222, 238, 254]. It is occasionally used as a treatment for intestinal worms[254]. Externally, an infusion is used to treat itchiness and formication, inflamed skin disorders such as eczema and rheumatic conditions such as gout[254]. The leaves are harvested in the summer as the plant comes into flower and are dried for later use[4]. The essential oil in the leaves is antiseptic, though it is toxic in large doses[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Pot-pourri: Aromatic plants used to impart a pleasant smell to an area. Can this be grouped with incense or essential oil?,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil is obtained from the whole plant, used in soap making[46, 61] and as a cleanser for fabrics[169]. A yield of 14kg of oil per hectare is considered good[4]. The plant has a low spreading habit and can be used as a ground cover, though it is somewhat sparse in the winter and can be invaded by the more aggressive weeds[K]. The growing or dried plant repels fleas, ants, moths, mice etc[18, 20, 148, 169, 201, 238]. Rats and mice intensely dislike the smell of mint. The plant was therefore used in homes as a strewing herb and has also been spread in granaries to keep the rodents off the grain[244]. A strong infusion applied to the face will keep gnats away in the summer[245]. The aromatic leaves are used as an ingredient of pot-pourri[238]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils and situations so long as the soil is not too dry[200]. Plants are very quickly diminished by dry conditions[4]. Prefers a stiff moist soil that is slightly acid[16, 27, 37, 200]. A sunny position is best for production of essential oils, but plants succeed in partial shade. Pennyroyal is often grown in the herb garden and is also cultivated commercially as a medicinal plant[4, 115]. There are two main forms of this species. One has weak prostrate stems and spreads by rooting where the stems touch the ground, it is only 10cm tall[4]. The other is erect, does not spread so freely and grows about 30cm tall, thus making it easier to harvest[4]. There is also at least one named form, called 'Dwarf' it is only a few centimetres tall[183]. The whole plant a strong spearmint smell. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[24]. A good companion plant for cabbages and tomatoes[20], helping to repel cabbage root fly and other burrowing insects[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually fairly quick. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer. Mentha species are very prone to hybridisation and so the seed cannot be relied on to breed true. Even without hybridisation, seedlings will not be uniform and so the content of medicinal oils etc will vary. When growing plants with a particular aroma it is best to propagate them by division[K]. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame. They will quickly become established and can be planted out in the summer."
