The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  wet soil and can grow in water.",,Pond; Bog Garden;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Oil: Oil,Pollen: ,Oil: ","aw or cooked. Rich in starch, they can be boiled and eaten like potatoes or macerated and then boiled to yield a sweet syrup[172]. The root can also be dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereal flours. Rich in protein, this flour is used to make biscuits, bread, cakes etc. Young shoots in spring - raw or cooked. An asparagus substitute. They are peeled before being eaten[172] Base of mature stem - raw or cooked. It is best to remove the outer part of the stem. Young flowering stem - raw, cooked or made into a soup. Tastes like sweet corn[172]. Seed - cooked. The seed is rather small and fiddly to utilize, but has a pleasant nutty taste when roasted. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. Due to the small size of the seed this is probably not a very worthwhile crop. Pollen - raw or cooked[172]. A protein rich additive to flour used in making bread, porridge etc[183]. It can also be eaten with the young flowers, which makes it considerably easier to utilize. The pollen can be harvested by placing the flowering stem over a wide but shallow container and then gently tapping the stem and brushing the pollen off with a fine brush[9]. This will help to pollinate the plant and thereby ensure that both pollen and seeds can be harvested[K].",Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.MiscellanyNone known,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","The stems and leaves have many uses, they make a good thatch, can be used in making paper, can be woven into mats, chairs, hats etc. They are a good source of biomass, making an excellent addition to the compost heap or used as a source of fuel etc. The hairs of the fruits are used for stuffing pillows etc. They have good insulating and buoyancy properties. The pollen is highly inflammable and is used in making fireworks. This plants extensive root system makes it very good for stabilizing wet banks of rivers, lakes etc.",,"Grows in boggy pond margins or shallow water to 15cm deep[1, 200]. Requires a rich wet soil if it is to well[200]. Succeeds in sun or part shade[200]. This species is believed to be a naturally occurring hybrid between T. angustifolia and T. latifolia[270]. Plants can be very invasive, spreading freely at the roots when in a suitable site[200].","Seed - surface sow in a pot and stand it in 3cm of water. Pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible and, as the plants develop, increase the depth of water. Plant out in summer. Division in spring. Very easy, harvest the young shoots when they are about 10 - 30cm tall, making sure there is at least some root attached, and plant them out into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
