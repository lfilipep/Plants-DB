22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a position in full sun in a circumneutral soil[108, 200]. Succeeds in ordinary garden soils, tolerating poor soils[1, 111]. Plants are liable to die out if the soil is too rich[111]. This species currently does not have a legitimate name(1999), it is a hybrid of garden origin, possibly E. capitatum x E. hieraciifolium. A perennial, it is usually grown as a biennial in the flower garden for spring and early summer bedding. A very ornamental plant, it is liable to die out after flowering, probably because it exhausts itself[1]. A good butterfly plant[30].",
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow late spring in an outdoor seedbed. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 weeks[164]. Transplant into their permanent positions in late summer. The taproot can be broken in order to encourage fibrous roots.,
