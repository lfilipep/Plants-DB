See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in June, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Hedge;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - cooked[160]. Small but produced in abundance. The seed of a plant seen at the Royal Horticultural Gardens, Wisley in Surrey in September 1993 was about twice the size of C. arborescens but it had a distinctly bitter taste[K]. High in protein, it has been recommended as an emergency food for humans. Young buds - cooked as a green vegetable[272].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

An important fuel wood for people living at high elevations[272].",,"Succeeds in most well-drained soils, but prefers full sun and a light sandy dry or well-drained soil[1, 11, 200]. Does not require a rich soil[11], succeeding on marginal land[160]. Succeeds in acid or alkaline soils[160]. Established plants are drought resistant[160]. This species is hardy to at least -20°c[184], it prefers a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters so it does not grow so well in the milder western half of Britain[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. It usually germinates in 2 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water then sown in a cold frame[78, 113, 200]. If the seed has not swollen then scarify it and re-soak for another 12 hours before sowing[138]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c[138]. Good percentage[11]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[113].
