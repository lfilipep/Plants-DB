13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Berberis canadensis is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.8 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Agreeably acid[2, 22, 46, 95, 161], they are an acceptable raw fruit in small quantities but are more commonly used in preserves[177, K]. The fruits are about 9mm long[200]. Leaves - raw. A trailside nibble[102]. Flowers[102]. No more details."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  DysenteryBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. A tea made from the roots is used in the treatment of fevers and diarrhoea[222]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the root.
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm moist loamy soil but is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[11, 200]. The plant is an alternate host of 'black stem rust' of cereals and so it is often grubbed out when growing wild in cereal-producing areas. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely and resprout well from the base[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]."
