13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Pink, White. Main Bloom Time: Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Upright or erect."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Trillium grandiflorum is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 0.3 m (1ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from April to June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Young leaves - cooked and used like spinach[46, 61, 105, 183]. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails[177]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  OphthalmicThe root is diuretic[257]. The raw root is grated and applied as a poultice to the eye in order to reduce swelling[207, 213]. The raw root s also used as a poultice on aching rheumatic joints[257]. A decoction of the root bark can be used as drops in treating a sore ear[257]. The grated root is steeped in water and drunk as a tea for the treatment of cramps[207]. The grated root is simmered in water and drunk for the treatment of irregular menses[207, 213]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Ground cover, Woodland garden. Prefers a deep well-drained woodland or humus-rich soil in a somewhat shady position that remains moist in the summer[1, 42]. Prefers a neutral to slightly acid soil but succeeds in acid or limey soils[200]. Grows well in open woodland[1, 90]. Succeeds in deep shade[188]. Succeeds in a sunny position if the soil does not dry out[42, 138]. A very ornamental and long-lived plant[1, 138, 233]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233], though slugs are very fond of the leaves[238]. A polymorphic species, it is very subject to mutation[90]. Some named varieties have been selected for their ornamental value[200]. Any transplanting is best done whilst the plants are in flower[200]. Plants can flower in two years from seed[138]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 3. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. Ephemeral emerging in spring and dying back by summer every year  [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a shaded cold frame as soon as it is ripe[134, 200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring. Seed usually germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c. Another report says that seeds produce a root after the first cold stratification but no shoot is produced until after a second winter[138], whilst yet another report says that the seed can take 3 years to germinate[238]. The seedlings are prone to damp off and must therefore be watered with care and given plenty of fresh air[138]. The young plants need to be overwintered in a cold frame for the first year and can then be planted out in late spring. It is very important that the pots become neither too dry nor too wet[138]. Division with care when the plants die down after flowering[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring."
