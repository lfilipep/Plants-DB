24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown and very tolerant plant, succeeding in any fertile soil, and preferring a good moist soil in a sunny position[11, 200]. It produces less fruit when grown in the shade[200]. Plants have proved to be quite wind resistant when growing on an exposed site in Cornwall[K]. Plants are hardy to about -25°c[184]. Closely allied to L. ledebourii[11]. There are some named forms, developed for the ornamental garden[182]. 'Humilis' is a smaller form and 'Serotina' is later flowering[182].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification[113] and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with or without a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm with or without a heel, November in a cold frame. Good percentage[78]. Layering in autumn[200].",
