13,Summary,"Luffa aegyptiaca or commonly known as Loofah is an annual vine popular for its fruits. It is native to South and Southeast Asia. The flowers are yellow. The fruits are about 30 cm long resembling a cucumber. The fruits are edible when young but become highly fibrous and inedible as they mature. However, such characteristics of mature fruits make it ideal to use as a scrubbing sponge. Young shoots, leaves, flower bugs, and seed are edible as well. The seed also yields edible oil. Further, loofah exhibits medicinal properties as well. It controls bleeding, improves circulation, and promotes healing. The fruit, in particular, is used in the treatment of various conditions such as rheumatism, chest pains, back pains, orchitis, hemorrhoids, internal bleeding, and insufficient lactation.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Luffa aegyptiaca is an evergreen Annual Climber growing to 15 m (49ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It can also be grown in subtropical and temperate areas so long as there is a growing season of 4 months or more[418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 27°c, but can tolerate 10 - 38°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 300 - 3,000mm[418 ]. Yields can be reduced in areas of heavy rain[300 ]. Prefers a position in full sun[238 ]. Plants succeed in poor soils, but fruit best in soils of moderate fertility[296 ]. Plants are most productive when grown in well-drained soils with a high content of organic matter[300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.3 - 8.3[418 ]. Plants can produce their first crop of immature fruits within 2 months from seed[296 ]. Mature fruits take 3 - 4 months to ripen[418 ]. Yields of up to 30 - 40 tonnes per hectare, or 20 - 25 fruits per plant, have been recorded[418 ]. Hand pollination of female flowers in the morning can increase yields[300 ]. There are some named varieties[300 , 301 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - can be sown in situ or in containers[300 ]. When sowing in containers, place 2 - 3 seeds in each container, thinning to the best plant once they have germinated. Keep the plants growing quickly and plant out once they are 15cm or more tall.",
