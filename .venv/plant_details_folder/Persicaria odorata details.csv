19,Edible Uses Description,"ng leaves are used raw or cooked as a flavouring [296 , 301 ]. The aroma is rather similar to coriander, with a hot, peppery but refreshing flavour [296 , 301 ]. Leaves have a coriander-like smell and a spicy, pungent, hot peppery flavour.[2-2]. A few leaves can be added to a mixed salad, or they can be cooked with rice, vegetables etc [301 ]. The flavour is destroyed by prolonged cooking [310 ]. A few young shoots, combined with water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica) are often added when preparing cabbage preserved in brine (like sauerkraut) [310 ]. Older, more red, leaves are generally considered too peppery to be used [301 ]. Although relished by the Vietnamese, the flavour of the leaves is not universally admired, though it is liked by some people who do not appreciate the taste of coriander leaves [310 ]. An oil can be extracted from the plant and is called Kesom oil - used as a flavouring [1-4].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A short-lived herbaceous perennial plant often grown as an annual. Succeeds in tropical to warm temperate areas[46 ]. Light frost is probably tolerated[310 ]. Requires a moist soil, succeeding in shallow water[296 ]. Fertile soils with adequate soil moisture are essential for optimal production[310 ]. It grows best under partial shade, but full sunlight is tolerated if ample moisture is available[310 ]. The first harvest of the leaves can be taken when plants are nearly 2 months old; subsequent harvests are every 12 - 15 days in tropical areas[310 ]. Plants prefer boggy soils including ones with some standing water. Plants begin to struggle when temperatures dip below 45 degrees F. Pots can be brought indoors in fall for overwintering, but overwintering can sometimes be difficult because of the need to provide moist and humid growing conditions. Bloom in late summer, but bloom infrequently occurs in cool climates.  [2-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. The plant is easily propagated by stem cuttings with 4 - 6 internodes (8 - 10 cm long) taken from the top of mature stems[310 ]. These are planted obliquely 5 - 6 cm apart with a row spacing of 10 - 15 cm in raised beds of light, well-manured soil and are watered well[310 ]. Under warm and humid conditions cuttings start rooting after 3 - 5 days and growing after about a week[310 ].",
