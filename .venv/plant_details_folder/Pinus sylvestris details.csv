A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antiseptic  Aromatherapy  Bach  Balsamic  Diuretic  ExpectorantScot's pine has quite a wide range of medicinal uses, being valued especially for its antiseptic action and beneficial effect upon the respiratory system. It should not be used by people who are prone to allergic skin reactions whilst the essential oil should not be used internally unless under professional supervision[254]. The turpentine obtained from the resin is antirheumatic, antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, rubefacient and vermifuge[4, 13, 46]. It is a valuable remedy in the treatment of kidney, bladder and rheumatic affections, and also in diseases of the mucous membranes and the treatment of respiratory complaints[4]. Externally it is used in the form of liniment plasters and inhalers[4]. The leaves and young shoots are antiseptic, diuretic and expectorant[9]. They are harvested in the spring and dried for later use[9]. They are used internally for their mildly antiseptic effect within the chest and are also used to treat rheumatism and arthritis[254]. They can be added to the bath water for treating fatigue, nervous exhaustion, sleeplessness, skin irritations[9]. They can also be used as an inhalant in the treatment of various chest complaints[9]. The essential oil from the leaves is used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory infections, and also for digestive disorders such as wind[254]. An essential oil obtained from the seed has diuretic and respiratory-stimulant properties[254]. The seeds are used in the treatment of bronchitis, tuberculosis and bladder infections[254]. A decoction of the seeds can be applied externally to help suppress excessive vaginal discharge[254]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Self-reproach', 'Guilt feelings' and 'Despondency'[209]. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Invigorating'[210].",
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Packing: Used as a filler in boxes etc in order to protect the contents.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. A reddish yellow dye is obtained from the cones[6]. This tree yields resin and turpentine[64, 66, 100, 171]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used in perfumery and medicinally[46, 61]. A fibre from the inner bark is used to make ropes[115]. The roots are very resinous and burn well. They can be used as a candle substitute[115]. The leaves are used as a packing material[46]. The fibrous material is stripped out of the leaves and is used to fill pillows, cushions and as a packing material[7]. Trees are very wind resistant and quite fast growing. They can be planted as a shelterbelt, succeeding in maritime exposure[75, 200].  - light, soft, not strong, elastic, durable, rich in resin. Used in construction, furniture, paper manufacture etc.[13, 46, 100]. A good fuel but it is somewhat smokey[6, 66, 115].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Timber: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional TimberLandscape Uses:Christmas tree, Specimen. Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Trees grow well on poor dry sandy soils[11, 81]. Fairly shade tolerant[186]. Prefers a light acid soil, becoming chlorotic at a pH higher than 6.5[186]. Trees can succeed for many years on shallow soils over chalk[185]. Tolerates chalk for a while, but trees are then short-lived[81]. Tolerates some water-logging[186]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[186]. Very wind resistant[49, 75], tolerating maritime exposure[166]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[226]. Fairly long-lived, to 200 years or more and quite fast growing[185], but trees are very slow growing in wet soils[81]. Young trees can make new growth of 1 metre a year though growth slows down rapidly by the time the tree is 18 metres tall[185]. This species is extensively used in cool temperate forestry as a timber tree[200]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Cones take two seasons to ripen[7]. Plants are easily killed by fire and cannot regenerate from the roots[186]. A good food plant for the caterpillars of several species of butterflies[30]. This tree has over 50 species of associated insects[81]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[188]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",
