It is native to South America and Trinidad and Tobago. The oil obtained from the kernel of the seeds has medicinal purposes. It is used through rubbing as relief from rheumatism. It can also be used in cooking. The large and brown or yellow fruit is edible and is used to make a drink. Endosperm of the seed is edible as well and often toasted. Further, the apical bud is eaten as vegetable. The pulp of the fruit yields oil for biodiesel production. Mature leaves are used for thatching while young leaves are used as weaving material. A. maripa can be used as a pioneer species due to its characteristics.","Attalea maripa is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",Attalea cryptanthera Wess.Boer Attalea macropetala (Burret) Wess.Boer Attalea regia (Mart.)

Fruit - raw[ 416 ]. A succulent, aromatic, almost fibreless pulp with a sweet, pleasant flavour[ 416 ]. It is used to make a drink[ 317 ]. The fruit is up to 5cm long[ 416 ]. The mesocarp provides a 'milk' for drinking[ 200 ]. Seed - the endosperm is toasted[ 317 ]. An oil extracted from the seed is used for cooking[ 317 ]. The outer husk of the fruit makes a kind of salty flour used to flavour food. The apical bud is eaten as a vegetable[ 317 ]. Eating this bud will effectively kill the tree since it is unable to produce side shoots[ 317 ].",Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.AntirheumaticAn oil obtained from the seeds is rubbed onto rheumatic areas of the body in order to bring relief[ 348 ].,"Beads: Used as necklaces etc.,Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other uses rating: Very High (5/5). Agroforestry Uses: The plant shows pioneer characteristics[ 419 ]. It regenerates vigorously after being cut down and the dormant seeds germinate after forest fires or the clearing of forested areas[ 419 ]. These traits make it an excellent choice as a pioneer species for restoring native woodland and especially, when taking into account all the plant's uses, for establishing a woodland garden[ K ]. Other Uses The fruit is a rich source of oil[ 314 ]. It is currently being investigated for its suitability for biodiesel production[ 314 ]. The leaves are used for thatching[ 317 , 768 ]. The young leaves are made into mats and pack baskets[ 317 ]. They are used as a heavy-duty weaving material[ 200 ]. The woody bract is used as a container[ 200 ]. The seeds are used to make jewellery[ 757 ]. The wood is moderately heavy, hard, resistant, of low durability[ 419 ]. The whole trunks are used locally for rustic constructions such as stays, rafters and laths[ 419 ].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of the lowland, moist tropics. Plants are frost sensitive[ 314 ]. Requires a sunny position in a well-drained soil[ 314 ]. Plants are usually found in more open areas in the wild but also succeed in the dappled shade of the forest[ 419 ]. Found in a range of soils from sandy to clayey[ 419 ]. Plants have a moderate rate of growth[ 419 ]. Production: The palms start to flower in the tenth year. They can live for 200 years. It produces 2-6 fruiting clusters each year. The kernel is 66% oil. In Bolivia there are an average of 182-211 trees per hectare. Fruit yields are 2456-2624 kg per hectare.",Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a nursery bed or individual containers[ 419 ].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
