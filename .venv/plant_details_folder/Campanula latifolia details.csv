It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very robust plant, capable of succeeding in the wild garden and tolerating considerable neglect[271]. It succeeds in most fertile well-drained soils[233], though it prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Prefers a humus-rich soil in shade or partial shade[271]. Grows well in cool moist woodlands with light shade where it can spread freely[1]. Plants occasionally grow in old walls[219] and also succeed in the dry shade of trees[233]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. A very ornamental plant, there are some named varieties[187]. The species can be quite invasive, though most of the cultivars that have been selected for flower colour are less rampant[271]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a cold frame. Three or four weeks pre-chilling of the seed improves the germination rate[138]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can also be sown outdoors in situ during the spring. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring."
