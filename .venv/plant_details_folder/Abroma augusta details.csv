22,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Regional CropA plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,200 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 31°c, but can tolerate 18 - 36°c[418].It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,500 - 3,000mm, but tolerates 1,300 - 3,500mm, and dislikes marked dry seasons[418].

The plant yields three crops a year, and is said to be more easily cultivated than jute (Corchorus spp.) or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea)[454]. Can be grown as an annual. Bloom Color:Maroon/Burgundy. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: coppice.",
