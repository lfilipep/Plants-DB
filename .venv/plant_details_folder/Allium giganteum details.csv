Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention of medicinal uses has been seen for this species, members of this genus are in general very healthy additions to the diet. They contain sulphur compounds (which give them their onion flavour) and when added to the diet on a regular basis they help reduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the digestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[K].","Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent.

Prefers a hot, sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1], it grows well in the light shade of thinly-clad shrubs that also like hot dry conditions[200]. The bulbs tend to rot when grown in cool wet climates, even if they are given sharp drainage[203]. One report says that this species is only hardy to zone 8, which only covers the mildest areas of Britain[200], whilst another says that it is much hardier and will succeed in zone 4[203]. It is being grown successfully about 60 kilometres west of London, and so should be hardy at least in the south of Britain[242]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].

Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. The plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season, pot up the divisions in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are growing well and then plant them out into their permanent positions.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
