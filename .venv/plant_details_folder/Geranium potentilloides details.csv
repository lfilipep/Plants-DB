24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of this country. The following comments are based on the general needs of the species. Succeeds in any moderately fertile retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates a wide range of soil types[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
