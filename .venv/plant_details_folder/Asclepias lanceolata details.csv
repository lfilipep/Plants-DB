They are usually avoided by grazing animals[274].","Swamps, mostly near the coast[235].",Eastern N. America - New Jersey to Florida and Texas,(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsclepiasLanceolata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AsclepiasLanceolata2.jpg",,"Asclepias lanceolata is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from June to August, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, insects, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",A. paupercula.,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.,Shoots: ","Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,Sweetener: includes sugar substitutes.","erThe following uses have been recorded for the closely related A. rubra. They probably also apply to this closely related species[K]. Flower buds - cooked as potherbs or added to soups[207]. Young shoots and leaves - cooked as potherbs or added to soups[207]. Young seed pods, 3 - 4 cm long, cooked[207]. Flower clusters can be boiled down to make a sugary syrup[207]. A chewing gum can be made from the latex contained in the stem and leaves, but it is possibly toxic[207].","Warts: Used in the treatment of warts, corns etc.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.WartsThe latex is used as a cure for warts[168].,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.","The following uses have been recorded for many other members of this genus, it is fairly safe to assume they can also be applied to this species[K]. A fibre is obtained from the bark[92, 99]. It is used in twine, coarse cloth, paper etc[92, 99]. The seed floss is used to stuff pillows etc or is mixed with other fibres to make cloth[168, 169]. It is a Kapok substitute, used in Life Jackets or as a stuffing material[169]. It is very water repellent. The floss has also been used to mop up oil spills at sea. Rubber can be made from latex contained in the leaves and the stems[57, 92, 112].",,"Prefers a well-drained light rich or peaty soil and a sunny position[1, 134, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is closely related to A. rubra[200]. This species has less flowers than most other members of the genus[235]. Many members of this genus seem to be particularly prone to damage by slugs. The young growth in spring is especially vulnerable, but older growth is also attacked and even well-established plants have been destroyed in wet years[K]. Plants resent root disturbance and are best planted into their final positions whilst small[134]. The flower of many members of this genus can trap insects between its anther cells, the struggles of the insect in escaping ensure the pollination of the plant[207].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn or in late winter[134, 169]. We have also had good results from sowing the seed in the greenhouse in early spring[K], though stored seed might need 2 - 3 weeks cold stratification[134]. Germination usually takes place in 1 - 3 months at 18°c[134]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out when they are in active growth in late spring or early summer and give them some protection from slugs until they are growing away strongly. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. Pot the divisions up and place them in a lightly shaded position in the greenhouse until they are growing away strongly, then plant them out in the summer, giving them some protection from slugs until they are established.. Basal cuttings in late spring. Use shoots about 10cm long with as much of their white underground stem as possible. Pot them up individually and place them in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse until they are rooting and growing actively. If the plants grow sufficiently, they can be put into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in the greenhouse until the following spring and when they are in active growth plant them out into their permanent positions. Give them some protection from slugs until they are established.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
