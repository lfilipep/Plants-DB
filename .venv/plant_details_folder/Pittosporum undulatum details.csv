4,Known Hazards,"This plant contains saponins[152, 154]. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans, and although they are fairly toxic to people they are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down if the food is thoroughly cooked for a long time. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]."

21,Other Uses Description,"Can be grown as a windbreak hedge in the mildest areas of the country, resisting maritime exposure[167]. . Used in the manufacture of golf clubs[200]."
22,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: StandardLandscape Uses:Container, Screen, Specimen. Succeeds in most well-drained soils of reasonably good quality in full sun or light shade[1, 200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Tolerates maritime exposure[1]. This species is only hardy outdoors in the mildest areas of Britain[182], tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[260]. Very amenable to pruning, plants can be cut right back into old wood if required[200]. The species in this genus are very likely to hybridize with other members of the genus[200]. When growing a species from seed it is important to ensure that the seed either comes from a known wild source, or from isolated specimens in cultivation. The flowers are powerfully scented at night and are pollinated by night-flying moths[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow when ripe in the autumn or in late winter in a warm greenhouse[78, 200]. The seed usually germinates freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, move the plants to a cold frame as soon as they are established and plant out late in the following spring[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold during their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Poor to fair percentage[78]. Basal ripewood cuttings late autumn in a cold frame[200]."
