Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed or in individual containers. A very high germination rate can be expected from fresh seed, with the seed sprouting within 5 - 10 days[419 ]. When the seedbed-sown seedlings are 4 - 6cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 3 - 4 months later[419 ].
