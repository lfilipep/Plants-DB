The main use of this herb is as an emmenagogue, though it is also a good stimulant tonic and has some nervine principle[4]. It is sometimes given to young children in order to expel parasitic worms and externally it is applied to small wounds in order to stop them bleeding and help them to heal[7]. The herb is also used externally in aromatic bathes and as a poultice to treat skin conditions[268]. Southernwood should be used internally with caution, see the notes above on toxicity.

Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. Southernwood is often grown in the herb garden, the leaves are very aromatic[182].

Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow from late winter to early summer in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 2 months at 15°c[134]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. Once the seedlings are more than 15cm tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or summer. Cuttings of young wood 8cm long, May in a frame[169].
