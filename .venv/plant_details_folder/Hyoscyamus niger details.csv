19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Anthelmintic  Antispasmodic  Antitumor  Diuretic  Epilepsy  Febrifuge  Hallucinogenic  Hypnotic  Mydriatic  Narcotic  Sedative  UrinaryHenbane has a very long history of use as a medicinal herb, and has been widely cultivated to meet the demand for its use[4]. It is used extensively as a sedative and pain killer and is specifically used for pain affecting the urinary tract, especially when due to kidney stones[254]. Its sedative and antispasmodic effect makes it a valuable treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, relieving tremor and rigidity during the early stages of the disease[254]. This species is the form generally considered best for external use, whilst the white henbane (H. albus) is considered the most appropriate for internal use[4]. All parts of the plant, but especially the leaves and the seeds, can be used - they are anodyne, antispasmodic, mildly diuretic, hallucinogenic, hypnotic, mydriatic, narcotic and sedative[4, 9, 13, 21, 100, 165, 192, 218]. The plant is used internally in the treatment of asthma, whooping cough, motion sickness, Meniere's syndrome, tremor in senility or paralysis and as a pre-operative medication[238]. Henbane reduces mucous secretions, as well as saliva and other digestive juices[254]. Externally, it is used as an oil to relieve painful conditions such as neuralgia, dental and rheumatic pains[238, 254].The leaves should be harvested when the plant is in full flower and they can then be dried for later use[4]. There is an annual and a biennial form of this species, both can be used medicinally but the biennial form is considered to be superior[4]. This is a very poisonous plant that should be used with great caution, and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[21, 238]. See the notes above on toxicity. The seed is used in the treatment of asthma, cough, epilepsy, myalgia and toothache[218]. The seeds are used in Tibetan medicine, they are said to have a bitter, acrid taste with a neutral and poisonous potency[241]. Anthelmintic, antitumor and febrifuge, they are used in the treatment of stomach/intestinal pain due to worm infestation, toothache, inflammation of the pulmonary region and tumours[241]."
20,Other Uses,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
21,Other Uses Description,The leaves scattered about a house will drive away mice[207].
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position[4] and a dry soil[19]. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1] but prefers an alkaline soil[200]. Plants succeed in sandy spots near the sea[4]. Cultivated commercially as a medicinal plant[57], only the biennial form is considered officinal[4]. Grows well in maritime areas, often self-sowing freely[200]. Older plants do not transplant well due to a brittle taproot[200]. The growing plant inhibits the growth of clover[18]. The flowers emit a sickly fishy smell[245]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow summer in a cold frame and pot on as soon as possible before the taproot is too long[200].
