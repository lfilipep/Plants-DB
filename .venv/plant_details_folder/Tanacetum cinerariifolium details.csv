Pyrethrum cinerariifolium.,Cultivated Beds;,None known,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.VermifugeDalmatian pellitory is not used medicinally, though research has shown that the flowers possess weak antibiotic activity[268]. The flowers are the main source of the insecticide pyrethrum, which is toxic to insects but not to mammals. It has sometimes been used as a vermifuge in China[147].","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The dried flower buds are the source of the insecticide 'Pyrethrum'[1, 4, 14, 18, 46, 57, 61]. The pyrethrins are produced in the yellow disc florets[169]. The highest pyrethrin content is from the flowers when they are in full bloom (1.22%) and lowest in the preceding period (0.71%)[240]. This insecticide also kills many beneficial insects, though it is relatively harmless to mammals[4]. Another report says that it is non-toxic to mammals[238]. It is best used in the evening so that it will have lost much of its virulence by the morning[201]. Steep two handfuls of the dried powdered flowers in one litre of hot water for an hour. This mixture can be either pureed or strained and then used as a spray[201]. Once dried, the flowers or the powder retain their insecticidal properties almost indefinitely[238]. The growing plant can be used as an insect repellent in the garden[14, 18, 20]. Effective against mosquitoes and ants[201].","Industrial Crop: Pesticide: Many plants provide natural pesticides.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Industrial Crop: Pesticide  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropSucceeds in an ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a rich soil with plenty of humus[147]. Prefers a pebbly, calcareous dry soil in a sunny position[4]. When grown in moist climates the plants often die after flowering[4].Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 7.5. Pyrethrum is widely cultivated as a source of an insecticide[57, 61], the growing plant is also said to repel insects from plants growing nearby[14, 18, 20].",Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the pot to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
