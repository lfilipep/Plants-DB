The optimal rooting temperature is with a bottom heat of 21 - 23°c[423 ]. Avoid heavy misting since the roots develop slower when the soil is waterlogged[423 ]. Avoid disturbing the plant roots during the propagation[423 ]. Root cuttings - these are made with 25mm long root segments. The top of the root should be level with the surface[423 ]. Air layering. Division of root suckers. Some cultivars produce an abundance of suckers that can be removed when their root system is developed.
