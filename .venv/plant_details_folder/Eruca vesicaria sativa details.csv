See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from May to August, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",E. sativa. Mill. E. vesicaria.

A distinct strongly spicy flavour[183], the taste is best from fast, well-grown plants[200]. A few leaves added to a salad are acceptable though the flavour is too strong for many tastes[K]. Some people really like these leaves though most are not very keen[K]. Older leaves that have become too hot to eat on their own can be pureed and added to soups etc[183]. In the milder areas of Britain it is possible to produce edible leaves all year round from successional sowings, especially if the winter crop is given some protection[K]. Flowers - raw[52}. A similar taste to the leaves, they make a nice garnish on the salad bowl[183]. The seed yields a semi-drying oil[1, 2, 74] which is edible if stored 6 months[61, 114] and is a substitute for rapeseed oil[34]. It contains 32% fat, 27% protein[114]. It is known as 'jamba oil'[183]. A mustard is obtained from the seed[46, 74, 183], the strong flavour comes from an essential oil that is contained within the oil of the seed[114]. The pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[238].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antiscorbutic: A plant rich in vitamin C that is used to counteract scurvy.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The leaves are antiscorbutic, diuretic, stimulant and stomachic[4, 46]. The seed is rubefacient and stimulant[4, 46]. The powdered seed possesses antibacterial activity, but no alkaloids have been isolated[240]. The oil from the seed is said to have aphrodisiac properties[264].","Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The seed yields a semi-drying oil which is a substitute for rapeseed oil[46]. It can also be used for lighting, burning with very little soot[114].",,"A very easily grown and fast-maturing plant, it succeeds in most soils and conditions, though it prefers some shade in summer[52]. Once established, plants are quite drought resistant[160]. Rocket is occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers, it can be ready for harvest within 40 days of sowing the seed[1, 46, 89, 264], there are some named varieties. 'Rocket Improved' is less prone to bolting, though it still grows best in cooler weather[183]. Plants usually self-sow freely if the ground is disturbed in some way, such as by hoeing[K]. This species is normally untroubled by pests or diseases[160].","Seed - sow outdoors in spring in situ. Germination is usually very quick and free. In order to obtain a continuous supply of edible leaves, successional sowings can be made every few weeks until mid August[33]. A late summer/early autumn sowing can provide leaves in winter, though the plants might require some protection in very cold winters[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
