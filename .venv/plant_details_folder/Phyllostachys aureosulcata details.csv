The rootstock is running but only slightly so in the cooler climate of Britain. In warmer climates (e.g. US South West) it can spread indefinitely if not confined with an underground barrier. A good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees.,"Phyllostachys aureosulcata is an evergreen Bamboo growing to 6 m (19ft) by 6 m (19ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Young shoots - raw or cooked. They have very little bitterness, even when eaten raw[183, 195]. The canes of plants grown in Britain are about 25mm in diameter[K], though they can reach up to 4cm in diameter[266]. The shoots are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level. Young culms are green with yellow grooves.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",The canes are not of the best quality but make good plant supports[195]. A good screen plant.,,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position. One report says that this is a very hardy plant, withstanding temperatures down to about -20°c, whilst another says that it dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. The rootstock is running but only slightly so in the cooler climate of Britain. In warmer climates (e.g. US South West) it can spread indefinitely if not confined with an underground barrier. The bottoms of some culms have large kinks in them, this limits their use for timber etc but makes them more ornamental. Heat zone: 12-3.","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
