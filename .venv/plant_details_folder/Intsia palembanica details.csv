13,Summary,"Intsia palembanica or commonly known as Borneo Teak is a tree growing up to 50 m tall with trunk diameter of up to 120 cm. It can be found in forests in East Asia. Young seeds are edible. The bark and wood yields brown and yellow dyes used for coloring mats and clothes. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, durable and resistant to fungi, wood borers, and termites. It is used for high-grade construction work, interior finishing, panelling, parquet flooring, furniture, etc.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Intsia palembanica is an evergreen Tree growing to 80 m (262ft) by 60 m (196ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Bark and leaves are used medicinally[310].,
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: Brown and yellow dyes are obtained from the bark and wood[46 , 310 ]. They are used for colouring mats and clothes[46 ]. The heartwood is orangey-brown, becoming dark red-brown or dark brown when exposed to the light; it is clearly demarcated from the 5 - 8cm wide band of white or pale yellow sapwood. The texture is coarse but even; the grain interlocked or wavy. The wood is heavy; hard to very hard; strong; durable, being resistant to fungi and dry wood borers, and moderately resistant to termites and ocean water. It seasons slowly, with only a slight risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is stable in service. The wood works well but has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct; the wood takes a very fine polish. It is used for high-grade construction work, interior finishing, panelling, parquet flooring, furniture, railroad ties and beams[46 , 661 , 848 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A tree of the moister lowland tropics found most commonly near sea level, though it can succeed at elevations up to 450 metres[303 ]. It grows best in areas where the minimum temperature does not fall below 17°c and the maximum is no higher than 33°c[303 ]. It is susceptible to frost[303 ]. It tolerates an annual rainfall in the range of 1,500 - 2,300 mm[303 ]. The following notes are taken from Intsia bijuga, and are likely to be more or less true for this species. Prefers a position in full sun[307 ]. Prefers a very well-drained soil[307 ]. Plants are very tolerant of saline soils and salt-laden winds[303 , 307 ]. Established plants are moderately drought tolerant[303 ].",
