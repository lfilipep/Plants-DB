Plants withstand light frosts[206]. Whilst this species is often grown as an ornamental in the West, in the Orient the variety C. coronarium spatiosum L.H.Bailey is comonly cultivated as a vegetable[200]. This variety is treated separately. There are many named varieties[183]. It takes 4 - 5 weeks from sowing the seed to the first harvest when plants are grown on the cut and come again principle[206]. Plants often self-sow when they are well-sited and the soil is disturbed by hoeing etc[K].",Seed - surface-sow in spring to early autumn in situ. The seed usually germinates within 10 - 18 days at 15°c[206]. Successional sowings can be made at intervals of a few weeks in order to ensure a constant supply of young plants[206]. Autumn sowings succeed in mild areas[164]. An autumn sowing under cover will often supply leaves all winter[206].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
