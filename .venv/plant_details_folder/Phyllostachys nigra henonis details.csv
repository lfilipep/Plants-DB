See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",P. henonis.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Hedge;,"Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Young shoots - cooked[25, 46, 105, 177]. Somewhat acrid when raw[61], they are prepared for eating by boiling in one change of water, the water being changed after 8 - 10 minutes[183]. A distinctive taste and aroma[183]. The shoots, which are about 5cm in diameter[266], are harvested in the spring when they are about 8cm above the ground, cutting them about 5cm below soil level.","Antiemetic: Prevents vomiting.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiemetic  Depurative  Diuretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  SedativeThe leaves are antipyretic and diuretic[218]. They are used internally in the treatment of fevers (especially infantile convulsions), vomiting and nosebleeds[176, 238]. The leave are harvested during the growing season and dried for later use[238]. The juice of the stems is antipyretic, antitussive, expectorant and sedative[147, 176, 218]. It is taken internally in the treatment of lung infections with cough and phlegm[238]. The sap is pressed from young stems in the summer and then dried for later use[238]. The epidermis of the stem bark is antiemetic and sedative[147, 176, 218]. It is used internally in the treatment of vomiting, nosebleeds, coughs etc[238]. The epidermis is collected from young stems in the summer and is dried for later use[238]. The root is astringent, antipyretic, depurative, diuretic and styptic[147, 176, 218]. It has been used in the treatment of rabies[147, 238]. A decoction is also used in the treatment of high fevers and nocturnal fretfulness in infants[147]. The roots are harvested in the winter and dried for later use[238].","Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.","The canes make good plant supports. Thin walled but durable, the canes are also used for cabinet work and for decorative panels and inlays[195]. The rhizome is used in making umbrella handles, wickerwork, canes, musical instruments and various kinds of handicrafts[25, 74].",,"Requires a rich damp soil in a sheltered position[200] and plenty of moisture in the growing season[1]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -7°c, but it dislikes prolonged exposure to hard frosts[200]. Another report says that it tolerates temperatures down to about -20°c[195]. A very ornamental plant[1], this is the form of P. nigra that is most commonly met in the wild. It is believed that this form is the true wild form and that the species is in fact a garden cultivar. However, since that form was the first to be named botanical etiquette demands that this form is treated taxonomically as a cultivar[195]. It is this form 'Henonis' that is used medicinally in China[176]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. This is a good companion species to grow in a woodland because the plants are shallow rooted and do not compete with deep rooted trees[195]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. The plant has a running rootstock, though not aggressively so in the cooler climate of Britain[200]. and it produces new shoots from May[25]. Dead stems can be removed at any time of the year[238]. It is also possible to thin the clumps in spring, leaving only the strongest stems and thus creating an open grove-like effect[238]. Cultivated for its edible young shoots in China[61]. This species has been widely planted for ornament in the Mediterranean and is becoming established[50].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Divisions from the open ground do not transplant well, so will need careful treatment and nurturing under cover in pots until at least late spring[238]. Division is best carried out in wet weather and small divisions will establish better than large clumps[238]. Another report says that you can take large divisions from established clumps and transfer them straight to their permanent positions, misting or drenching them frequently until they are established[200].
