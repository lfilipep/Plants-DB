0,Rubus odoratus,"Thimbleberry, Purpleflowering raspberry",Rosaceae,3-7,None known,Moist thickets and woodland borders[43].,Eastern N. America - Quebec to Ontario and south to Tennessee. Occasionally naturalized in Britain.,(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RubusOdoratus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RubusOdoratus2.jpg",,"Rubus odoratus is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 2.5 m (8ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to September, and the seeds ripen from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 161, 257]. Somewhat tart and dry[2], it is usually cooked and used in pies, jellies, preserves etc[183]. The fruit can be dried for later use[257]. This species rarely fruits well in Britain, probably due to our cooler summers[11].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diuretic  Dysentery  Kidney  Odontalgic  Salve  StomachicThe leaves are highly astringent[207]. They are used in the treatment of dysentery and diarrhoea[238]. The leaves have been used as a wash for old and foul sores, boils etc[257]. A decoction or infusion of the branches has been used to settle the stomach[257]. A decoction of the leaves and stems has been used to treat kidney complaints[257]. The root is astringent. A decoction of the root or the root bark has been used as a treatment for diarrhoea and colds[257]. The root has been used in the treatment of toothaches[257]. The berries have been used as a diuretic[257].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168]. Plants are very vigorous and can be grown as a tall ground cover for large areas[208].,,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Grows well in a sandy soil but does not like clay[182]. Prefers a semi-shaded position. Does well in a woodland garden though it is less likely to fruit well in such a position. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -30°c[184]. The glandular hairs on the stems have a powerful resinous scent somewhat like cedarwood[245]. A vigorous suckering shrub, it has perennial stems without prickles[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - requires stratification, is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Sow stored seed as early as possible in the year in a cold frame and stratify for a month at 3°c if sowing later than February. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
