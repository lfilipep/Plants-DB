0,Asplenium adiantum-nigrum - L.,Black Spleenwort,Polypodiaceae,5-9,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].","Rocky woods, hedgebanks, shady walls and rocks[17].","Most of Europe south of the Faroes, including Britain, to the Himalayas, N. and S.
