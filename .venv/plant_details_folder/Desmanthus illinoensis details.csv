See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",D. brachylobus. Acuan illinoensis. (Michx.)Kuntze.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - cooked. Rich in protein but without much flavour[183]. The seedpods are about 25mm long and contain 3 - 5 small seeds[235]. They are freely borne in the plants native environment, but will have to be very freely produced in this country if it is to be a worthwhile crop[K].","Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antipruritic  OphthalmicA leaf tea has been used in the treatment of itchy skin[222, 257]. Five seeds have been placed in the eye at night and washed out in the morning to treat trachoma[257].",,"Root bark of D. illinoensis has been found to contain N,N-DMT, NMT, N-hydroxy-N-methyltryptamine, 2-hydroxy-N-methyltryptamine, and gramine (toxic). The root bark is mixed with a native source of beta-Carbolines to produce a hallucinogenic drink called prairiehuasca, which is an analog of the shamanic brew ayahuasca.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.","Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Protein  Under DevelopmentRequires a moist but well-drained soil in full sun[200]. Plants are often found growing in clay soils in the wild[274]. Suitable for the wild garden or other naturalistic plantings[200]. In favourable situations this plant can self-sow to the point of nuisance[200]. This plant is being evaluated by the Land Institute of Salina, Kansas, as an edible legume for growing with perennial grains in a non-tillage permaculture system[183]. It is certainly worthy of more attention in this country, though the small seed size mitigates against its use[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water and then sow in a cold frame in the spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. If you have sufficient seed then it is probably worthwhile sowing some in situ in mid to late spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
