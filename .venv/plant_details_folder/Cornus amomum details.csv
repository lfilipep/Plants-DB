Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Astringent  Diuretic  Poultice  Stimulant  Stomachic  VDThe dried root-bark is antiperiodic, astringent, stimulant (mild), tonic[4]. The flowers are said to have similar properties[4]. A tea or tincture of the astringent root bark has been used as a quinine substitute and also in the treatment of chronic diarrhoea[4]. It has also been employed in the treatment of painful urination, chest congestion etc[257]. The bark was also used as a poultice on external ulcers and as a wash for gonorrhoea sores[4, 257]. The glycoside 'cornin' found in the bark has astringent properties[4]. The fruits are used as a bitter digestive tonic. A tincture of them has been used to restore tone to the stomach in cases of alcoholism[4].",Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,The powdered bark is used as a toothpowder[61].,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden.

The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of warm stratification before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
