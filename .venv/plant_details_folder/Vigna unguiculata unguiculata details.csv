13,Summary,"Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, or commonly known as Black-Eyed Pea, is a subspecies of cowpea often cultivated for its edible seeds. It is an annual climbing plant growing up to 4 m in length with straight firm pods. The leaves have three leaflets. Flowers which are white, yellow or blue and large occur often in pairs on the end of long flowering shoots. The seeds are white with a black/dark spot. Being a legume, it has a capability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and functions as a green manure. The seeds are cooked. Immature seeds are used as a vegetable while mature seeds are added to soups and stews or ground into a powder. The seeds can also be sprouted then eaten raw or cooked. Roasted seeds are grounded into a powder and used like coffee. Immature seedpods are eaten raw or cooked. Leaves are cooked like spinach. Crushed leaves are used in a poultice for broken bones.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Vigna unguiculata unguiculata is a ANNUAL CLIMBER growing to 4 m (13ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[46 ]. They can be eaten whilst still green or allowed to dry[46 ]. The immature seeds are used as a vegetable - they can be steamed, boiled, stir-fried etc[301 ]. Mature seeds are added to soups and stews, ground into a powder and used with cereal flour for making cakes, bread etc, or fermented into dosa[301 ]. The seeds can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked in stir-fries etc[301 ]. The roasted seed can be ground into a powder and used like coffee[301 ]. Immature seedpods - raw or cooked[46 , 301 ]. Leaves - cooked like spinach[301 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.PoulticeThe crushed leaves are used in a poultice to heal and bond broken bones[348 ].,
22,Other Uses,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,
23,Other Uses Description,Agroforestry Uses: Grown as a green manure crop[46 ]. Other Uses None known,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the lowland tropics, where it can also be cultivated at elevations up to 1,500 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 35°c, but can tolerate 10 - 40°c[418 ]. The plant cannot tolerate frost It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 600 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 400 - 4,100mm[418 ]. Prefers a position in full sun, tolerating light shade[418 ]. Succeeds in a wide variety of soils, from sandy loams to clays, so long as they are well-drained[300 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.3 - 8.8[418 ]. Good yields have been obtained on peaty soils, but the plant dislikes alkaline soils since this reduces nodulation of bacteria on the roots and causes chlorosis of the leaves[300 ]. Young seed pods can be harvested about 2 months after sowing, whilst mature seeds can be obtained in 3 - 5 months[300 ]. Up to 6 tonnes per hectare of pods can be obtained per hectare, or 400 - 750kg of dried seed[300 ]. There are many named varieties[300 , 301 ]. Most cultivars are day-length neutral, though short-day forms are also known[300 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - pre-soak for 12 hours in warm water and sow 1 - 3cm deep in situ[300 ]. The seed germinates best when the soil temperature is above 21°c[300 ].,
