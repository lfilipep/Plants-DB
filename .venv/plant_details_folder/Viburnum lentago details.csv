18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 55, 62, 65, 257]. It can also be dried for winter use[55]. The fruit is variable in size and quality, the best being about 15mm long, pulpy, very sweet, somewhat juicy and pleasant tasting but with a thick skin and a single large seed[43, 82, 101, 159, 183]. The fruit is said to be best after a frost[102] but it is sometimes dry[159].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Diuretic  EmmenagogueThe bark is antispasmodic[102]. A decoction of the roots has been used to treat irregular menstruation and the spitting of blood[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been used in the treatment of measles[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been drunk, or a poultice of leaves applied, in the treatment of dysuria[257].",
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The plant is grown as a hedge in N. America[226].  - heavy, hard, close grained, malodorous[82, 226]. Of no commercial value due to the small size of the trees[229].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Screen, Specimen. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but is ill-adapted for poor soils and for dry situations[1]. It prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c[184]. A fast-growing but short-lived species in the wild[229]. It readily sprouts from the roots and forms thickets, a habit that is undesirable in small gardens[226]. The plants grow well, but do not usually fruit well in Britain[11, 200]. This is probably because they are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200].  Special Features: North American native, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78].",
