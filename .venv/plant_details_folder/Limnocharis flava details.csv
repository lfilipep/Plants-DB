13,Summary,"Sawah lettuce (Limnocharis flava), also known as yellow sawah lettuve, yellow burr head, or yellow velvetleaf, is an aquatic flowering, clump-forming, perennial plant which produces erect stems about 20-40cm tall from a short thick rhizome. It is native to Dominican Republic, Mexico, Haiti, Cuba, South America, and Central America but widely naturalized in southern and southeastern Asia. The triangular leaves form into clumps. The stems are hollow. The inflorescence consists of three-lobed yellow flowers. The fruits are spherical. Though considered as an invasive plant and has great potential to become a weed, it is a known vegetable in some countries. In particular, the flower stalk and leaves are used in dishes as well as the immature flower buds. The plant is also used for green manure.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Limnocharis flava is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Grows best in shallow, neutral to slightly acidic water[200 ]. If allowed to grow unchecked, the plant may become a very invasive environmental weed of streams and wetlands. It has become a serious weed in rice fields, irrigation canals and wetlands in South-East Asia[413 ]. Clumps of the weed provide a congenial breeding site for disease-vectors, including mosquitoes, which encourages the spread of diseases such as Japan fever and dengue fever[413 ]. Plants are reproduced mainly by seeds - these are dispersed via the production of fruitlets, which are buoyant and carried by water to new localities, dispersing seeds along the way[413 ]. Fruiting takes place throughout the year, with a single fruit producing about 1,000 seeds and a single plant producing about 1,000 fruits per year[413 ]. Bloom Color: Bright Yellow White/Near White. Spacing: 18-24 in. (45-60 cm).",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - seed must be kept damp or it loses viability[200 ]. Sow in a constantly damp medium at 20c, cover with silver sand and immerse in 1cm of water once the seedlings have germinated[200 ]. Division",
