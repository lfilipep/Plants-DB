24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors in this country. It succeeds on infertile acid soils[183]. This plant was cultivated as a biennial cereal by the Araucana Indians of Chile until at least the middle of the last century. Thought to have become extinct, it has recently (1990 article) been rediscovered[183]. It has been grown successfully outdoors at Kew Gardens in Londn[K]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most well-drained soils in a sunny position[138, 200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in situ and only just cover. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If seed is in short supply it can be surface sown in a cold frame in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in early summer.",
