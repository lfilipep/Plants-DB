It succeeds on infertile acid soils[183]. This plant was cultivated as a biennial cereal by the Araucana Indians of Chile until at least the middle of the last century. Thought to have become extinct, it has recently (1990 article) been rediscovered[183]. It has been grown successfully outdoors at Kew Gardens in Londn[K].

Germination should take place within 2 weeks. If seed is in short supply it can be surface sown in a cold frame in early spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
