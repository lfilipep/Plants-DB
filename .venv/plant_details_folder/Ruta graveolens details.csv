Often cultivated as a culinary and medicinal herb, there are some named varieties[187]. The bruised leaves have a pleasant orange-like fragrance[245]. It is one of the most pleasant herbs to inhale[245]. Rue releases its scent in a remarkable way. The essential oil is contained in a cavity immediately beneath the surface of the leaf, above which is a thin layer of cells pierced by a cavity in the middle. The cells swell up and bend inwards, pressing on the essential oil beneath, which is driven to the surface of the leaf and there released[245]. Rue is a poor companion plant for many other species, growing badly with sage, cabbage and sweet basil[14, 18, 20, 201]. It is a good companion for roses and raspberries[201]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].

When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of young shoots in late spring[1]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Very easy[K]. Layering in early summer.
