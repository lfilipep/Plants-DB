See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",H. acicularis. H. tenuifolia. Conchium aciculare.

Shrubs are planted for the reclamation of arid land in Spain and Portugal[50]. Plants are used for screening purposes in Australia[157].",,"Succeeds in a hot dry position, requiring a lime-free soil[182]. Requires plenty of moisture in the growing season but a very well-drained soil[1]. Wind tolerant[166]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, but it succeeds outdoors in S.W. England[11]. Plants are hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder wetter winters. They grow well in a Mediterranean climate, with cool wet winters and hot dry summers[200]. Some forms of this species are lower growing with a tendency to sucker[157]. Sometimes confused with H. lissosperma, some plants grown as H. acicularis are H. lissosperma[11]. A good bee plant. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow March in a greenhouse. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78].
