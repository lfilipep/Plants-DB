23,Other Uses Description,"A gum, somewhat similar to gum tragacanth (which is obtained from various Astragalus spp), is obtained from the stems[64, 154]. Shrubs are planted for the reclamation of arid land in Spain and Portugal[50]. Plants are used for screening purposes in Australia[157].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a hot dry position, requiring a lime-free soil[182]. Requires plenty of moisture in the growing season but a very well-drained soil[1]. Wind tolerant[166]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, but it succeeds outdoors in S.W. England[11]. Plants are hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder wetter winters. They grow well in a Mediterranean climate, with cool wet winters and hot dry summers[200]. Some forms of this species are lower growing with a tendency to sucker[157]. Sometimes confused with H. lissosperma, some plants grown as H. acicularis are H. lissosperma[11]. A good bee plant. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a greenhouse. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Cuttings of mature wood[1].",
