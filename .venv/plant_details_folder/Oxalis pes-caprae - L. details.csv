1,Common Name,Bermuda Buttercup
2,Family,Oxalidaceae
3,USDA hardiness,8-11
4,Known Hazards,"The leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them their sharp flavour. Perfectly all right in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since oxalic acid can bind up the body's supply of calcium leading to nutritional deficiency. The quantity of oxalic acid will be reduced if the leaves are cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a sandy soil in a warm dry position[1]. This species is not very cold-hardy in Britain, though it is naturalized in parts of south-western England[1, 17]. It tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[90]. Plants spread rapidly when in a suitable environment and can quite easily become a weed in virtually frost-free environments[200, 260]. Plants seldom produce seed in Europe but they spread by means of asexually produced bulbils[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.
