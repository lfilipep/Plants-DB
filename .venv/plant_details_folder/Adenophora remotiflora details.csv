24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light rich slightly alkaline soil that is not too dry, and a warm sunny position[1, 200]. Plants are intolerant of root disturbance[1]. The young growth is extremely attractive to slugs, they have been known to destroy even mature plants[K]. There is some confusion over this name. Some reports, especially [105] and [179] refer to A. remotifolia. Miq. We assume that this is a mis-spelling for this species but we could be wrong[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring. Surface sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot in the spring in order to avoid transplanting[133]. We have found that if transplanted when very small seedlings grow away without difficulty[K]. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 10°c[133]. Plant out into their permanent positions whilst young. Basal cuttings in spring[K]. Division in spring - very difficult because the plant dislikes root disturbance[1]..
