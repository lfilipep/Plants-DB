See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen from October to February. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.",A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Diuretic  Pectoral  Poultice  Rubefacient  Salve  Skin  Vermifuge  VulneraryThe turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. A poultice of the wetted inner bark has been applied to the chest in the treatment of strong colds[257]. The dried and powdered leaves have been used as an inhalant for people who are unconscious[257]. A decoction of the leaves and the bark have been used in a herbal steam bath to relieve the pain of headaches and bad backs[257].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. The bark contains tannin and has occasionally been exploited commercially[46, 82, 229]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. This species is the most resinous pine in Canada[226]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing canoes, containers etc, as a wood preservative etc[257].  - light, hard, very close grained[46, 82, 171, 226]. It weighs 30lb per cubic foot[235]. Tree trunks in dense stands are almost free of knots[226]. The wood is largely used for construction, piles etc and as a source of pulp[46, 82, 171, 226].",,"Thrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200, 226] and windy situations[226]. The red pine is often cultivated as a timber crop in Europe[50]. It is used as a re-afforestation tree in Canada[226]. Slow growing when very young, though it speeds up[229] and new shoots of 60cm a year have been recorded[185]. It takes 20 - 25 years before reliable seed production begins, good crops are then produced every 4 - 5 years[229]. This tree does not seem to be long-lived in Britain and is only found in the south-east of the country, though it should succeed elsewhere[185]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18]. Trees have a fairly thick bark and this helps to protect them from heat of forest fires[226]. The cones are 5 - 6cm long[82], they take 2 years to ripen then open and shed their seed whilst still attached to the tree[82, 226]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The resin from broken shoots has a strong scent of lemon balm[185]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
