Calycanthus contains calycanthine, an alkaloid similar to strychnine, and it is toxic to humans and livestock[270].","Rich low shady woodlands[4, 43]. Deciduous or mixed woodlands, along streams and rivers, margins of woodlands from sea level to1850 metres[270].","South-eastern N. America - Virginia to Florida, west to Alberta and West Virginia.",(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CalycanthusFloridus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CalycanthusFloridus2.jpg","Bloom Color: Red.Main Bloom Time: Early summer, Early spring, Late summer, Late spring, Mid summer, Mid spring. Form: Oval, Rounded.","Calycanthus floridus is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.7 m (8ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. sterilis.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.","The aromatic bark is dried and used as a substitute for cinnamon[2, 11, 46, 61, 105, 161, 183]. Some caution is advised, see reports above on toxicity[270].","Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Antispasmodic  Cardiac  Disinfectant  Diuretic  Emetic  Ophthalmic  SkinAntispasmodic, disinfectant[106, 169]. The plant contains an alkaloid that has a powerfully depressant action on the heart[4]. A fluid extract has been used as an antiperiodic[4]. A tea made from the root or bark has been used as a strong emetic and diuretic for kidney and bladder ailments[222, 257]. A cold tea has been used as eye drops in the treatment of failing eyesight[222, 257]. An ooze from the bark has been used to treat children's sores, whilst an infusion has been used to treat hives[257].","Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","Leaves contain small quantities of camphor. They can be used as an insect repellent, perfume and disinfectant[169, 257].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Prefers a light loamy soil that is deep and moist but succeeds in most fertile soils[11, 182]. Requires a well-drained soil[188]. Prefers a sunny position but it tolerates shade when grown in warm temperate zones[11, 200]. Requires a sheltered position, protected from cold winds[245]. Although the dormant plant is hardy to at least -20°c, the tender young growth in the spring can be damaged by late frosts[K]. All parts of the plant are richly fragrant[182]. The flowers have a refreshing scent of ripe apples[245]. The wood, leaves and roots smell strongly of camphor, whilst the bark smells like cinnamon[245]. This species is closely related to C. mohrii[182]. A very ornamental plant, there is at least one named variety developed for its ornamental value. 'Mrs Henry Type' is a large-flowered form[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Wetlands plant, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A clumping plant, forming a colony from shoots away from the crown but with a limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. If the seed is harvested 'green' (as soon as it has fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately it can germinate in 3 weeks[113]. Dried seed germinates in 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Stored seed requires between 3 weeks and 3 months cold stratification before sowing in the spring. When large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. They can be difficult[113]. Layering in spring. Sever the new plants in a wet spell of weather about 15 months later and then lift them in the autumn[78]. High percentage[78]. Division of suckers in early spring[11]. Very easy, they can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
