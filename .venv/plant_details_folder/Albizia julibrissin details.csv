See also birthing aids.,Plaster: Used in the treatment of broken bones.,Plaster: Used in the treatment of broken bones.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Anthelmintic  Carminative  Digestive  Diuretic  Oxytoxic  Plaster  Plaster  Sedative  Stimulant  Tonic  VulneraryThe flower heads are carminative, digestive, sedative and tonic[176, 218, 238]. They are used internally in the treatment of insomnia, irritability, breathlessness and poor memory[176, 238]. The flowers are harvested as they open and are dried for later use[238]. The stembark is anodyne, anthelmintic, carminative, discutient, diuretic, oxytocic, sedative, stimulant, tonic, vermifuge and vulnerary[176, 178, 218]. It is used internally in the treatment of insomnia, irritability, boils and carbuncles[238]. Externally, it is applied to injuries and swellings[238]. The bark is harvested in spring or late summer and is dried for later use[238]. A gummy extract obtained from the plant is used as a plaster for abscesses, boils etc and also as a retentive in fractures and sprains[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Plaster: Used for covering walls.,Plaster: Used for covering walls."
23,Other Uses Description,"A gummy extract of the plant is used as a plaster[178]. No more details are given. Wood - dense, hard, strong, takes a good polish. Used for furniture, industrial applications, firewood etc[74, 158, 272]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Insect: Plants grown for useful fodder insects.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop  Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow  Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Insect  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional CropRequires a well-drained moisture retentive soil and a very sunny position[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Highly fertile soils can promote soft sappy growth which is frost tender[200]. Trees tolerate a high pH, saline soils, high winds and drought[200, 238]. They also succeed in poor soils[238]. Trees prefer a more continental climate than Britain[11] and when dormant are hardy to about -20°c in such a zone[200]. They are only hardy to about -10°c in the maritime climate of this country[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. They succeed on a sunny wall at Kew[11], and also in a more open but sunny sheltered position there[K], but only really succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of Britain[1]. If killed back to the ground by a severe winter, plants can often resprout from the base[200]. The form 'Rosea' is hardier and more compact, succeeding even in the drier parts of Britain if given some protection[11]. Plants are quite tolerant of pruning and can be fan-trained for growing on a wall. Any pruning is best done in late winter or early spring[202]. Often grown as a summer bedding plant[1]. Quite tolerant of being transplanted[200]. Plants often produce suckers[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak 24 hours in hot water and sow March/April in a greenhouse or sow as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[113]. Germinates in 2 - 3 months at 19°c. Scarification helps[133]. There are about 11,000 seeds to a pound, about 25 - 33% of which germinate[227]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Root cuttings, late winter in a greenhouse[113, 200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Suckers planted out in late winter[200]."
