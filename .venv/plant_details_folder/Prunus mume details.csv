0,Prunus mume,"Japanese Apricot, Japanese Flowering, Apricot",Rosaceae,6-8,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Thickets in W. China, 300 - 2500 metres[184].

Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Vase.","Prunus mume is a deciduous Tree growing to 9 m (29ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Armeniaca mume.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Flowers: ,Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 183]. Hard and sour even when fully ripe, it is scarcely edible[2, 11]. It is, however, widely used in the Orient where it is usually pickled and then used as a condiment and a vegetable[2, 11]. This is the umboshi plum that can be found in oriental stores. It is preserved in salt and used as a relish in rice dishes etc[183]. The fruit contains about 0.9% protein, 18.9% carbohydrate, 0.6% ash, no fat. The fruit is about 3cm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. The flowers are used as a flavouring in tea[2, 183]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity. Young budlings[183]. No more details are given.","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antipyretic: Treats fevers. See Febrifuge.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antipyretic  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Carminative  Cholagogue  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Pectoral  Sialagogue  VermifugeThe unripe fruit is antibacterial, antipyretic, antispasmodic, astringent, carminative, cholagogue, pectoral, sialagogue and vermifuge[116, 147, 174, 176, 178, 238]. The fruit has a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity[279]. Cooling and refreshing, it is mixed with other herbs and used internally in the treatment of bronchitis, chronic coughs, chronic diarrhoea and roundworms[174, 238, 279]. The fruit is also used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, to stop bleeding and to ease coughs[254]. Externally, it is applied to fungal skin infections, corns and warts[238]. The half-ripe smoked fruit is considered to be antispasmodic, carminative and febrifuge[218]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil, growing well on limestone[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Requires a sunny position and a sheltered site[11]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[184], it succeeds when grown against a sunny wall in Britain or in a sheltered woodland[184]. Much cultivated in China and Japan for its edible fruit, there are many named varieties[11, 184]. White-flowered forms possess a sweet perfume, but red-flowered forms have no scent[245]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
