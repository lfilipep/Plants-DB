Its bole is straight, cylindrical, and often buttressed. The leaves are large, hairy, yellow green when young and become reddish brown upon maturity. The flowers occur on spikes. A fast-growing tree commonly found in East Asia, it has edible seed which can be eaten raw, roasted, or baked. The seeds contain oil. The red, fleshy, and ellipsoidal fruits are edible as well. Okari nut is of no medicinal importance. The wood is sometimes used for furniture and construction. Plant is grown from seeds.","Terminalia kaernbachii is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

It is sometimes used for timber in furniture construction, but is seldom logged as it is excluded from timber purchases because of the value of its seed[303 , 701 ].","Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil).

A fast-growing tree when young, able to increase height by up to 2 metres a year[658 ]. Trees take many years to come into full bearing from seed, even when 20 years old they usually only produce small crops[658 ]. Seeds are harvested after they fall to the ground[658 ]. The plant often crops poorly when close to the sea, but can produce good crops when growing inland.  It is tolerant of poorly drained soils and grows in areas with a wide range of annual rainfall (2000-7000 mm) but is less common in regions where rainfall exceeds 7000 mm per year. The production of nuts occurs regularly throughout the year and is independent of rainfall seasonality [1-8].","Seed - germinates freely when fresh, but quickly loses its viability[303 , 658 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
