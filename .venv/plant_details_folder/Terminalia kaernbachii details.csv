23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The wood is moderately hard, inclined to be brittle[451 ]. It is sometimes used for timber in furniture construction, but is seldom logged as it is excluded from timber purchases because of the value of its seed[303 , 701 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilA plant of the tropical lowlands, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres[335 ]. Plants can be found at elevations up to 1,300 metres, but do not fruit well at these higher elevations[658 ]. Succeeds in any moderately fertile, well-drained soil in a sunny position[200 ]. A fast-growing tree when young, able to increase height by up to 2 metres a year[658 ]. Trees take many years to come into full bearing from seed, even when 20 years old they usually only produce small crops[658 ]. Seeds are harvested after they fall to the ground[658 ]. The plant often crops poorly when close to the sea, but can produce good crops when growing inland.  It is tolerant of poorly drained soils and grows in areas with a wide range of annual rainfall (2000-7000 mm) but is less common in regions where rainfall exceeds 7000 mm per year. The production of nuts occurs regularly throughout the year and is independent of rainfall seasonality [1-8].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - germinates freely when fresh, but quickly loses its viability[303 , 658 ].",
