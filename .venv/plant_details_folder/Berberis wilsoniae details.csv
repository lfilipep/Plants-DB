China.,(3 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BerberisWilsoniae.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/BerberisWilsoniae2.jpg",,"Berberis wilsoniae is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 2 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit raw or cooked. Very acid with a lemon-like flavour, it goes very well in a muesli[K]. Children and some adults like it raw, at least in small quantities, though most adults prefer to cook it and use it in pies, preserves etc[K]. The fruits are about 6mm long[200].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  DysenteryBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Plants can be grown as a tall ground cover when planted about 60cm apart each way[208]. A yellow dye is obtained from the root. A shrub for thorny barriers to deter unwanted visitors. Berries loved by birds.,,"Deciduous to semi-evergreen. Prefers a warm moist loamy soil but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[11, 200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus, especially the closely related B. aggregata[11, 200]. The true species is seldom seen in cultivation, having been replaced with its hybrid progeny[182]. There are some named forms, selected for their ornamental value[11]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely, they resprout well from the base[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Heat Zone 9-4.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
