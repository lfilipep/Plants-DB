0,Zantedeschia aethiopica,"Arum Lily, Calla lily, White Calla Lily",Araceae,8-10,"Many plants in this family are poisonous raw, due to the presence of calcium oxylate crystals. If eaten raw, this toxin gives you a sensation as if hundreds of tiny needles are sticking into the mouth, tongue etc. However, it is easily destroyed by thoroughly cooking or drying the plant. Although no specific mention has been seen for this plant it is wise to assume that it is poisonous in its raw state.","Wet marshy places[73, 90].",S. Africa. Locally naturalized in S. and W.

Best when growing in full sun[90]. Succeeds in wet soils or water up to 30cm deep[1, 200]. This species is only hardy to between -5 and -10°c[200], although some selected forms, such as 'Crowborough' and 'Green Spathe', are hardy in most parts of Britain if they are planted deeply in shallow water to about 30 cm deep[1, 90, 200]. It is best to cover plants with bracken in the winter in order to protect against exceptional frosts[90]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].

Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow in moist soil in spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division, preferably in the spring[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
