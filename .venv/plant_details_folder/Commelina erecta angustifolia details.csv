24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a light well-drained loam with added leafmold[42]. This species is not very winter hardy, the roots are best dug up in autumn and stored like dahlias in a cool frost free place being planted out in spring[200]. When grown in a light well-drained soil and mulched well, the roots usually survive the winter outdoors[1]. This plant is possibly no more than a narrow-leafed form of the highly variable C. erecta[200]. Whilst some botanists recognise it as a variety of C. erecta, the Flora of North America does not accept varietal difference and merges it into the species[270]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a greenhouse. The seed usually germinates in 4 - 5 weeks at 20°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in early spring. Make sure that each portion has at least one growing bud[111, K]. Cuttings during the growing season. Very easy[200]."
