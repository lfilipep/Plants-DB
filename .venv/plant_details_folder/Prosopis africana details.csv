13,Summary,"n the Serer creation myth, it is one of the sacred trees that grew not just first, but also within the primordial swamp on Earth.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prosopis africana is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The fermented seeds are used as a food condiment[418 , 774 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DysenteryThe leaves are used in the treatment of headache and toothache as well as various other head ailments[418 ]. The leaves and bark are combined to treat rheumatism[418 ]. The bark is astringent. It is used in the treatment of skin diseases, caries and fevers[418 , 491 ]. The bark is used to make an eyewash[418 ]. The roots are diuretic[418 ]. They are used to treat gonorrhoea, tooth and stomach-ache, dysentery and bronchitis[418 ].",
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is suitable for erosion control, shade and as an avenue tree[418 ]. It is planted to provide windbreaks, hedges and for soil conservation[325 ]. It can fix atmospheric nitrogen and the fallen leaves act as a green manure. It has great potential for parkland agroforestry systems and for improved agroforestry technologies in the Sahel, where it grows well in valleys and rocky soils[418 ]. Other Uses The bark and roots contain tannin[418 ]. The bark contains some 18% tannins[375 ]. A gum is obtained from the stems[303 ]. The ashes of the seedpods are used as a source of potash for soap making[303 ]. The sapwood is yellow, clearly demarcated from the red-brown heartwood, which becomes wine-red after drying[375 ]. The wood is hard; of medium to heavy density; with a fine grain; durable; resistant to termites[375 ]. It is hard to work as it blunts the tools, cannot be nailed without previous pre-drilling, but easy to carve, turn and glue[375 ]. The wood is used as timber for pestles, mortars, mallets, cudgels, furniture, joinery, sleepers in the construction of railway lines, boat building and axe handles[418 ]. It is sought for art and craft[375 ]. The wood is highly valued as a fuel and for charcoal making[375 , 418 , 491 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Parkland: Africa - Trees scattered throughout cropland. An Irregular intercropping system.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Pod  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Other Systems: Parkland  Regional CropA tree of semi-arid areas of the tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas where the mean annual temperature falls within the range 22 - 35°c, but can tolerate 18 - 40°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall of 300 - 500mm, tolerating 200 - 700mm[418 ]. Requires a well-drained soil and a sunny position[418 ]. Tolerant of most soil types[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, but tolerates 5 - 7.5[418 ]. The tree has a deep, fast-growing tap root[375 ]. Responds well to coppicing[375 ]. This is the only tropical African Prosopis species, occurring from Senegal to Ethiopia in the zone between the Sahel and savannah forests[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]. In it natural habitat, flowering occurs just prior to the rainy season. Seeds mature between February and March. Fodder: pod.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - fresh, still moist seed does not require pre-treatment, butdried seeds need to be pre-soaked for 12 - 24 hours in warm water until the seed shows visible signs of swelling. If necessary, make a small incision in the seed coat (being sure not to damage the embryo) to allow the ingress of water. Sow the seeds in a nursery bed. Germination of around 85% of the seeds can take place within a week at 25°c[325 ]. Seedlings are ready for planting out when 14 - 18 weeks old[303 ]. Air dried seeds can remain viable for several years at room temperature[325 ].",
