It is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. The leaves are oval to oblong, broad, glossy, green, and arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers have five petal-like lobes and are white to dark pink with a darker red centre in colour. It is commonly grown as an ornamental plant but it has long been used in traditional medicine. It has shown to have activity against leukaemia and other cancers. Different plant parts and forms are used in the treatment of various diseases such as hypertension, asthma, menstrual irregularities, dengue fever, chronic constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, malaria, etc.","Catharanthus roseus is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.7 m (2ft 4in) by 0.7 m (2ft 4in) at a fast rate.

Tests by pharmaceutical companies in the 1950's showed the presence of a number of medically active alkaloids, especially the compound vincristine, which has been shown to have activity against leukaemia[ 238 , 254 , 302 ]. The alkaloids, when isolated from the plant, are highly toxic but have also been shown to reduce the numbers of white blood cells, leading to applications which have revolutionized conventional cancer therapy[ 238 ]. The plant is cultivated as a source of these alkaloids, a number of which are extracted and used allopathically[ 299 ]. The isolated alkaloids are used to treat and other cancers[ 238 ]. The alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine are prescribed in anticancer therapy, particularly in cases of acute leukaemia (especially in children) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. They are usually part of a complex chemotherapy protocol[ 299 ]. Used in isolation, they have a number of side-effects, including alopecia, nausea and bone marrow depression[ 238 ]. The dried root is an industrial source of ajmalicine, which increases the blood flow in the brain and peripheral parts of the body. Preparations of ajmalicine are used to treat the psychological and behavioural problems of senility, sensory problems (dizziness, tinnitus), cranial traumas and their neurological complications[ 299 ]. The leaves and aerial parts of the plant have a wide range of traditional uses. Well known as an oral hypoglycaemic agent, the plant is also considered to be depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, purgative and vermifuge. A decoction is taken to treat hypertension, asthma, menstrual irregularities, chronic constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, dyspepsis, malaria, dengue fever, diabetes, cancer and skin diseases[ 238 , 299 , 348 ]. Extracts prepared from the leaves have been applied externally as antiseptic agents for the healing of wounds; to relieve the effects of wasp stings; against haemorrhage, skin rash and as a mouthwash to treat toothache[ 299 ]. The leaves are harvested when the plant is flowering, and can be dried for later use[ 238 ]. An infusion of the flowers is used to treat mild diabetes[ 348 ]. A decoction of the roots is taken to treat dysmenorrhoea[ 299 ].",Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"Other uses rating: Low (1/5). Other Uses: Cultivated as an ornamental. A bedding plant in temperate gardens. Noted for its long flowering period. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds.","Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.","Hypothetical Crop  Management: HayA plant of the tropics and subtropics, it can also be cultivated as an annual crop in warm temperate areas[ 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 30c, but can tolerate 10 - 34c[ 418 ]. At temperatures below 5c, some branches or even the whole plant will die. When the temperature rises, the plant will usually regrow from basal axillary buds, especially after hard pruning of the shoots and roots. Without pruning, the plant regrows mainly from the tops[ 299 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 1,200mm, but tolerates 800 - 1,400mm[ 418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 299 ]. An easily grown plant, it prefers a fertile, moist but well-drained soil in a sunny to partially shaded position[ 302 ]. Usually found on sandy soils in the wild, but sometimes also on rocky soils[ 299 ]. It is very tolerant of salt in the soil[ 299 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5.5 - 7.5[ 418 ]. The plant may become a naturalised weed, especially when growing in dry habitats[ 302 ]. In the tropics, the roots are ready for harvest after one year[ 418 ]. In Hungary, when grown as an annual, average yield is 3.5 - 4.5 tonnes/ha of the fresh herb, or 1 - 1.5 tonnes/ha of dried herb[ 418 ]. Under irrigation conditions, 1.5 tonnes/ha of roots, 1.5 tonnes/ha of stems and 3 tonnes/ha of leaves can be obtained[ 418 ]. The plant is usually self-fertile, but self-incompatible strains exist and can be locally common in the wild[ 299 ].","Seed - sow in a seed tray. Germination takes 15 - 21 days at 21c, with more than 95% of the seed sprouting[ 200 , 299 ]. Seedlings are ready to pot up after 3 weeks[ 299 ]. Seed can remain viable for 3 - 5 years[ 299 ]. Greenwood or semi-ripe cuttings. When rooting hormone is used, the cuttings will start to root after 4 - 5 weeks[ 299 ]. Putting the cuttings in water will also induce rooting, but it will take longer than in the soil[ 299 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
