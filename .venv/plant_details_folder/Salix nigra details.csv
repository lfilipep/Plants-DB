13,Summary,Form: Oval.,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix nigra is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Shoots: ",
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"- raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - raw or cooked. They are not very palatable[172].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Antiperiodic  Antiseptic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Hypnotic  Sedative  TonicThe bark is anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiperiodic, antiseptic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge, hypnotic, sedative, tonic[4, 7, 9, 21, 165]. It has been used in the treatment of gonorrhoea, ovarian pains and nocturnal emissions[4]. The bark of this species is used interchangeably with S. alba. It is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, gout, inflammatory stages of auto-immune diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, feverish illnesses, neuralgia and headache[238]. The bark can be used as a poultice on cuts, wounds, sprains, bruises, swellings etc[257]. The bark is removed during the summer and dried for later use[238]. The leaves are used internally in the treatment of minor feverish illnesses and colic[238]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238]. The fresh bark contains salicin, which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[213] and as an ingredient of spring tonics[229].",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The young stems are very flexible and are used in basket and furniture making[171, 229]. The twigs can be split in half lengthways, sun-dried and used as the foundation of coiled basketry[257]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. A fibre obtained from the stems is used in making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in spring or summer, the leaves are removed and the stems steamed until the fibres can be stripped. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye and then beaten with mallets or put through a blender. The paper is red/brown in colour[189]. The trees are often used in erosion control, their roots forming dense networks that stabilize stream banks[229]. The bark is a good source of tannin[46, 227]. A decoction or infusion of the bark can be used as a hair wash to make the hair grow[257].  - not durable, light, soft and weak but does not splinter, warp or check[82, 149]. The wood is tough and fairly strong according to another report[171]. It weighs 27lb per cubic foot[227]. Used where strength is not important, for artificial limbs, barn floors etc[82, 123, 149]. A good charcoal is also obtained from the wood[61]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A fast-growing but relatively short-lived species, it can reach 15 metres tall within 10 years from seed in the wild[229]. Twigs tend to break off easily in storms, these will then often root and grow into new trees[226]. A good bee plant, providing an early source of nectar[11]. Trees are impatient of root disturbance and should be moved regularly before being planted in their permanent positions, which is best done whilst the plants are young[11]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. Plants should not be grown within 10 metres of buildings. Closely related to Salix caroliniana, hybridising with that species where their ranges overlap[274]. This species is also likely to hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Seedlings are very fast-growing, they can reach 1.2 metres tall in their first year[11]. Plants are used commercially for papermaking[189]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Grows submerged, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
