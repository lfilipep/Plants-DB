Also see Astringent.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Leprosy: Used to treat leprosy - a chronic bacterial infection of the skin and superficial nerves (in the skin) caused by Mycobacterium leprae.,Resolvent: Breaks down tumors. This might be placed under antitumor.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Acrid  Alterative  Antiasthmatic  Antibilious  Antidiarrhoeal  Antidote  Antiinflammatory  Bitter  Blood purifier  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Emetic  Febrifuge  Leprosy  Resolvent  Tonic  VulneraryAccording to Ayurveda, the root is bitter, acrid, cooling, vulnerary, alexipharmic. It is used in treatment of biliousness, leprosy, dysentery, vaginal and uterine complaints, inflammations, burning sensation, fatigue, asthma, leucoderma, blood diseases etc[646 ]. According to the Unani system of medicine, the root is resolvent, alternative, useful in diseases arising from blood impurities and bile, bilious fevers, piles, jaundice, leprosy etc[646 ]. The root is used to control alcoholism[348 ]. The leaves are bitter, mildly sudorific, tonic[348 ]. A leaf tincture is given by teetotallers to drunkards to remedy drunkenness[348 ]. The seed is emetic[348 ]. The plant contains the alkaloid 'mimosine'[646 ]. Extracts of the plant have been shown in scientific trials to be a moderate diuretic; to depress duodenal contractions in a similar manner to atropine sulphone; to promote regeneration of the nerves; and reduce menorrhagia[413 ]. The roots contain tannin, ash, calcium oxalate crystals and mimosin[646 ]. Root extracts are reported to be a strong emetic[413 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Straw: For drinking with."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The plant forms a dense ground cover and has been used to provide ground cover in coconut plantations[317 ]. It has been introduced to subtropical, humid areas of the Transcaucasus where it is cultivated for erosion control, ground cover and green manure[317 ]. The plant has been identified as having potential for phytoremediation of arsenic polluted areas in Thailand[413 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Pasture  Management: Fodder  Management: Hay  Regional CropA plant of the tropics, but also naturalized in the subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,300 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 28°c, but can tolerate 10 - 32°c[418 ]. It is intolerant of frost[413 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 900 - 3,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a sunny position, but can succeed in quite dense shade[418 ]. Plants are shade intolerant[413 ]. Succeeds in most soils, including those that are shallow or poor in nutrients[418 ]. The plant is well adapted to humid areas with high winds[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. The plant has become naturalized throughout the Tropics and much of the subtropics[317 ]. It has become a pest in forest plantations, cropland, orchards and pasture[413 ]. It is particularly likely to become a noxious weed when growing in dryland field crops, in rainfed wetland rice and in plantation crops[418 ]. Plants can flower all year round[418 ]. Plants are a fire hazard when dry[305 ]. Although they can be perennial, the plants can also complete their life-cycle within 90 days[418 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing"
