3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]."

19,Edible Uses Description,"Young stems and leaves[105, 145]. A famine food, only used in times of scarcity[218]. The spores are produced in a sporocarp (like a fairly large container) and in allied species this is ground up and mixed with flour etc and used in making bread etc. It is rich in starch[144]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a permanently moist or wet soil, it can be grown by the side of ponds etc or in the shallow edges of the pond[56]. Thrives in a turfy loam or in peat[1]. Hardy to about -15°c[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Spores. The plant produces sporocarps, these need to be lightly abraded and then immersed in water. The sporocarps will then swell and burst to release the spores. The spores germinate immediately, the highly developed prothallus remains inside the large seed-like spores. The gametophyte generation is completed in 24 hours and the first roots and shoots appear in 2 - 3 days. Mature plants bearing sporocarps can develop in as little as 3 months[200]. Spore germination in the family occurs after rupture of the sporocarp wall allows the sporocarp contents to be hydrated. A gelatinous structure emerges from the sporocarp, breaking it into valves and carrying the sori into the water. Spore germination (gametophyte growth) and fertilization occur immediately[270].
