18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires well-drained open loamy soil[11] in a warm, sheltered sunny position[200, 245]. Plants are best grown in semi-shade[219]. They are intolerant of water-logging[200] and of dry soils[219]. Succeeds in any soil, but new growth is less vigorous in dry soils[202]. One report says that the plant likes soil with a high chalk content[245], though another says that chlorosis occurs on very alkaline soils[202]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[184]; it grows well in the open at Kew[11]. A fairly slow-growing plant, it is shy to flower in British gardens unless placed against a sunny wall[219]. It flowers on wood that is 2 - 3 years old or older[182]. Another report says that the plant flowers on the new wood[219], whilst another says that it flowers on terminal clusters[245]. Any pruning is best done immediately after flowering by thinning out the old wood.[182, 219]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200], Closely related to A buddleioides and A. umbellata[182]. The flowers are wonderfully scented[182], with the fragrance of vanilla[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no specific information for this plant, but suggest sowing the seed in early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 -10cm with a slight heel, July in pots of sandy soil in a frame[11]. Takes 3 - 4 weeks. Very easy, a good percentage of the cuttings root[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel if possible, November in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering young shoots[245]."
