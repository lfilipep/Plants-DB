Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Requires a moist well-drained lime-free peaty soil[1, 11, 184] succeeding in a sunny position or partial shade[164]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c according to one report[184], this conflicts with another report that says it only succeeds outdoors in Britain from Sussex and westwards[11]. A third report says that the plant is generally hardy but sometimes fails in very cold districts of Britain[182]. The new growth in spring is very susceptible to damage by late frosts[49]. The flowers are fragrant[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse[113]. Only just cover the seed and keep the pot moist. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 13°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out once they are more than 20cm tall in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Very easy[113]. Root cuttings in December/January[113]. Suckers in the dormant season[113]. They can be planted out direct into their permanent positions if required. Layering of current years growth in late autumn. Takes 18 months. Can also be done in early spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
