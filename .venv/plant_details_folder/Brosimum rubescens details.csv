The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked. The wood is very hard, dense, very heavy; durable, with a high resistance to wood-eating organisms. It is slow to season, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it finishes well with a beautiful polish; nailing and screwing are good, but pre-boring is required; gluing is correct for internal purposes, but requires care because of the denseness of the wood. A very good quality wood, it is used for making high value items such as furniture, musical instruments, parquet flooring, wood ware, turned goods and fancy carpentry[ 46 , 625 , 848 ]."
