13,Summary,"A medium to large deciduous tree with  a round and spreading crown. It is a hardy, fast-growing tree that can be invasive. Some good edible, medicinal and other uses. Bloom Color: Yellow.Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Broussonetia papyrifera is a deciduous Tree growing to 9 m (29ft) by 9 m (29ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from August to September, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw[2, 105, 177, 179]. The fruit comprises a ball about 1.5cm in diameter with numerous small edible fruits protruding - there is not much edible flesh but it has a lovely flavour[K]. Prolonged ingestion is said to weaken the bones[179]. Leaves - cooked[105]. The dried leaf contains 1% calcium carbonate[179] (this report does not mention edibility). Flowers[179]. No more details."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Galactogogue: Promotes the flow of milk in a nursing mother.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Galactogogue  Haemostatic  Laxative  Ophthalmic  Skin  Stimulant  Stomachic  Tonic  VulneraryAstringent, diuretic, tonic, vulnerary[178]. The leaf juice is diaphoretic and laxative - it is also used in the treatment of dysentery[218]. It is also poulticed onto various skin disorders, bites etc[218]. The stem bark is haemostatic[218]. The fruit is diuretic, ophthalmic, stimulant, stomachic and tonic[218]. The root is cooked with other foods as a galactogogue[218]."
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Leather: Substitutes, that is.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre from the bark is used in making paper, cloth, rope etc[46, 61, 114, 171]. The fibre can be produced by beating strips of bark on a flat surface with a wooden mallet. A very fine cloth can be made in this way, the more the bark is beaten the finer the cloth becomes. Larger sizes can be made by overlapping 2 pieces of bark and beating them together. A leather substitute can also be made from the bark[171]. When used for making paper branches are harvested after the leaves have fallen in the autumn, they are steamed and the fibres stripped off. In humid areas this can be done without steaming the branches. The inner and outer bark are then separated by scraping (or simply peeling in humid areas) and the fibres are cooked for 2 hours with lye before being hand pounded with mallets. The paper varies in colour if the outer and inner barks are used together or separately[189].  - coarse grained, soft, easily worked, light, not very durable. Used for cups, bowls, furniture etc[149, 158, 178, 229, 266].  Its timber does not have high commercial value. Animal feed, fodder, forage: /animal feed, Invertebrate food for silkworms. Environmental Uses:Agroforestry. Erosion control or dune stabilization. Revegetation. Shade and shelter. Soil improvement. Windbreak.  [1d]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Coppice  Regional CropEasily cultivated in a warm sunny position in any soil of reasonable quality[11]. A drought resistant species once established[149], thriving on poor sandy or gravelly soils[200, 229]. Another report says that it does not thrive on poor soils[146]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A fast-growing tree according to one report[227], but whilst it might be fast in relation to other members of the genus, it is only of moderate growth compared to some species[K]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to about -10°c[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. There is a superb specimen of this tree at Cambridge Botanical gardens, in the late summer of 1996 it was about 12 metres tall and 16 metres wide and was bearing a huge crop of immature fruit[K]. The leaves on the same tree can vary widely in shape and size[K]. The paper mulberry is widely cultivated in E. Asia for the fibre in its bark, there are many named varieties[11, 200]. Trees are coppiced annually for this purpose[4], though the coppice interval in countries such as Britain would probably be 2 - 3 years. This is a very adaptable tree, it is found growing in tropical climates but its range also extends well into the temperate zone. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Not North American native, Invasive, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - no pre-treatment is required. Sown in the autumn or spring in a greenhouse, germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 8 - 12cm long with a heel, July/August in a frame. High percentage[11, 78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November in a frame[200]. Root cuttings in winter[200]. Layering in spring[200]."
