24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most soils[1]. Prefers a well-drained soil in full sun[200]. The long tap root is susceptible to rot in wet winters[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame[1]. Germination usually takes place within 3 - 6 weeks at 13°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. The seed can also be sown in situ as soon as the soil is workable in the spring[134]. Division in spring, with care[200].",
