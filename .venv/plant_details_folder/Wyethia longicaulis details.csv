Plants are intolerant of drought[200].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse or cold frame in early spring. Use a very freely-draining compost, prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out into their permanent positions when they are large enough. Careful division of the crown as the plants come into growth in spring[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
