24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil, tolerating some lime[1]. Requires a sheltered position and either high humidity or a moist riverside soil[200]. Dislikes wind exposure[200]. Tolerates woodland shade very well[200]. Requires hot, very humid summers for best growth[200]. A vulnerable species in the wild, where it is at risk of becoming extinct[266]. This species is not hardy in all parts of Britain, but trees can be grown outdoors in the milder parts of the country[81]. The seed takes two summers to mature[229]. There is some confusion over the correct name of this species, with some authorities seeing it as no more than a sub-species of T. fargesii[266]. Plants are dioecious, but sometimes monoecious with dioecious branches. Male and female plants must usually be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some of the seed should germinate in the following spring though much of it might take another 12 months. Stored seed requires a period of cold stratification and can take 18 months or more to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as growth is observed and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least the next couple of winters, making sure to pot them on into larger pots as and when required. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer when the plants are at least 20cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe shoots in late summer[1]. Cuttings do not grow well[11]. Layering."
