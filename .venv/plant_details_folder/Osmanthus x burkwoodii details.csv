21,Other Uses Description,"A good plant for a large hedge or screen[29, 182]. It responds well to pruning, though any trimming is best carried out in mid-summer[188]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil[1], but succeeds in any soil, including shallow chalk, in sun or part shade[11, 184, 202]. Dislikes unduly exposed conditions but succeeds in windier conditions than most other members of this genus[200]. Hardy to about -20°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are deliciously scented. If plants are clipped after flowering they will flower more freely each year[200]. Rather slow growing according to one report[11], whilst another says that plants are very free growing once they are established[182]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a coldframe[200]. Stored seed probably germinates best if it is given 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification before sowing[113]. The seed usually takes 6 - 18 months to germinate, it should be pricked out into individual pots when it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in the greenhouse and plant them out in early summer. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood taken at the end of July, in a frame with bottom heat[11]. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 12cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. A good percentage. Plant out in the spring 18 months later[78]. Layering in spring[200] or autumn[78]. Partially sever the layer leads in the following late summer and plant out in the autumn. High percentage[78]."
