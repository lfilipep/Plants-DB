22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep rich loam in a warm sheltered position in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Requires plenty of root room[11]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Plants rarely produce fruit in Britain except after a long hot summer[200]. Plants are occasionally cultivated in Japan for medicinal purposes[58]. The shoots have sticky pads and are self-supporting on walls[11]. Another report says that plants climb by means of coiling tendrils but large plants often need tying in to support the weight of foliage[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in pots in a cold frame in the autumn or stratify for 6 weeks at 5°c and sow in the spring[200]. Germination can be quite slow, sometimes taking more than a year. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. When they are more than 20cm tall, they can be planted out into their permanent positions, preferably in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings or eyes in late autumn or winter. Either place them in the ground in a greenhouse or cold frame, or put them in pots. An eye cutting is where you have just one bud at the top and a short length of stem with a small part of the bark removed. These normally root well and grow away vigorously, being ready to plant into their permanent positions the following autumn. Layering into pots in late summer. Partially sever the stem in spring and then lift the new plants in the autumn[78]."
