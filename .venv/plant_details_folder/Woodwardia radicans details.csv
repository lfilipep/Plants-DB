0,Woodwardia radicans,"Chain Fern, Rooting chainfern",Blechnaceae,8-11,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].","Woodland margins, often by streams[260].",South-western Europe and the Atlantic Islands.,(0 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Half Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/WoodwardiaRadicans.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/WoodwardiaRadicans2.jpg",,"Woodwardia radicans is an evergreen Fern growing to 1.8 m (6ft) by 0.6 m (2ft in).

Grows best in semi-shade[188]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, once established it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c[200, 260] and succeeds outdoors in the milder areas[208]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. A very ornamental plant[1].","Spores - best sown as soon as they are ripe, though they can also be sown in the spring. Sow them on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and keep humid until they are well established. Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position. Plants produce a plantlet at the tips of each frond. These can be detached from the parent plant and rooted in humid conditions in a frame or the fronds can be anchored down and the plantlet allowed to root in situ[200].
