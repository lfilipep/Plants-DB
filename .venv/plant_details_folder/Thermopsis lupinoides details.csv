24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200], though it prefers a rich light soil[1]. Judging by the plants native habitat, it is likely to be resistant to maritime exposure[K]. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species, with some authorities saying that the name we are using above is a synonym and that the correct name is T. lanceolata[200]. However, other authorities say that T. lanceolata is a distinct species found only in northern China and Russia, whilst this species (T. lupinoides) is also a distinct species found in Japan, eastern China, Korea and Russia[266]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually good and within a month[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring. Divided plants do not establish readily[1].",
