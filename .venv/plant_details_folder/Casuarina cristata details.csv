See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Mainly used for furniture and fencing, it is also a good fuel[156, 229].",,"Requires a well-drained moisture-retentive soil in full sun[200]. A report for Australian gardens says that it prefers growing in dry areas but also thrives in very wet soils[157]. Fast growing[157]. This plant tolerates temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] although this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder wetter winters. It might succeed outdoors in the mildest areas of the country[200]. The plant produces suckers from the roots and often forms dense groves[229]. Unlike most members of this genus, this plant does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [2-1].","Seed - sow late winter to early summer in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.
