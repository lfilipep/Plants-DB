Plants succeed in dry soils in the wild[71]. Requires a sunny position[11]. Hardy to about -20°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so they should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Closely allied to R. cruentum, R. lobbii and R. menziesii[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 - 5 months cold stratification at about 0°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
