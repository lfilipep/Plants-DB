13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Typha angustifolia is a PERENNIAL growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  wet soil and can grow in water."

19,Edible Uses Description,"aw or cooked[12, 13, 46, 94]. They can be boiled and eaten like potatoes or macerated and then boiled to yield a sweet syrup[183]. The roots can also be dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereal flours[62]. Rich in protein, this powder is used to make biscuits etc[183]. Young shoots in spring - raw or cooked[2, 12, 94, 159, 183]. An asparagus substitute[62]. Base of mature stem - raw or cooked[62]. It is best to remove the outer part of the stem[62]. Young flowering stem - raw, cooked or made into a soup[85, 94, 183]. It tastes like sweet corn. Seed - cooked[183]. The seed is very small and fiddly to harvest, but it has a pleasant nutty taste when roasted[12]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[85]. Due to the small size of the seed this is probably not a very worthwhile crop. Pollen - raw or cooked. A protein rich additive to flour used in making bread, porridge etc[12, 105, 183]. It can also be eaten with the young flowers[85], which makes it considerably easier to utilize[K]. The pollen can be harvested by placing the flowering stem over a wide but shallow container and then gently tapping the stem and brushing the pollen off with a fine brush[9]. This will help to pollinate the plant and thereby ensure that both pollen and seeds can be harvested[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anticoagulant: Removes blood clots.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticoagulant  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Haemostatic  Lithontripic  MiscellanyThe pollen is diuretic, emmenagogue and haemostatic[176]. The dried pollen is said to be anticoagulant, but when roasted with charcoal it becomes haemostatic[238]. It is used internally in the treatment of kidney stones, internal haemorrhage of almost any kind, painful menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, post-partum pains, abscesses and cancer of the lymphatic system[222, 238, 254]. It should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238]. Externally, it is used in the treatment of tapeworms, diarrhoea and injuries[238]. An infusion of the root has been used in the treatment of gravel[257]."
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre."
23,Other Uses Description,"The stems and leaves have many uses, they make a good thatch, can be used in making paper, can be woven into mats, chairs, hats etc[13, 46, 57, 61, 94]. They are a good source of biomass, making an excellent addition to the compost heap or used as a source of fuel etc. The hairs of the fruits are used for stuffing pillows etc[46, 57, 159]. They have good insulating and buoyancy properties[171]. The female flowers make an excellent tinder and can be lit from the spark of a flint[212]. The pollen is highly inflammable and is used in making fireworks[115]. This plants extensive root system makes it very good for stabilizing wet banks of rivers, lakes etc[200]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Hay  Staple Crop: ProteinA very easily grown plant, it grows in boggy pond margins or in shallow water up to 15cm deep[17]. It requires a rich soil if it is to do well[17]. Succeeds in sun or part shade. A very invasive plant spreading freely at the roots when in a suitable site, it is not suitable for growing in small areas. Unless restrained by some means, such as a large bottomless container, the plant will soon completely take over a site and will grow into the pond, gradually filling it in. This species will often form an almost complete monoculture in boggy soil. The dense growth provides excellent cover for water fowl[1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in a pot and stand it in 3cm of water. Pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible and, as the plants develop, increase the depth of water. Plant out in summer. Division in spring. Very easy, harvest the young shoots when they are about 10 - 30cm tall, making sure there is at least some root attached, and plant them out into their permanent positions."
