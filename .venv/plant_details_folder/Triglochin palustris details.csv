Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
