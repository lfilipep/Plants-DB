22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A parasitic plant, growing on the branches of several deciduous species of trees. It has a wide range of hosts, though it is usually only found on one species in any given area[200]. The host tree must be at least 20 years old[200]. This species is seldom cultivated since it can severely weaken its host[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,This is a parasitic plant that grows entirely on the host tree. To grow it you need to obtain berries and squash them onto the branches of host trees in late autumn and early winter[11]. This is best done on the lower side of the branch[1]. It is then simply a matter of waiting and hoping.,
