22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a cool lime-free well-drained sandy loam and a sunny position[1, 11]. Succeeds in neutral soils[11] and tolerates partial shade[200]. Likes plenty of moisture in the growing season[11]. A good sandy loam and a sunny position suits most members of this genus[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Closely related to D. bholua[11]. The flowers are fragrant[272]. Plants are resentful of root disturbance and should be planted into their permanent positions as soon as possible[188].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe with the pot sealed in a polythene bag to hold in the moisture. Remove this bag as soon as germination takes place[164]. The seed usually germinates better if it is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it dries on the plant) and sown immediately. Germination should normally take place by spring, though it sometimes takes a further year. Stored seed is more problematic. It should be warm stratified for 8 - 12 weeks at 20°c followed by 12 - 14 weeks at 3°c. Germination may still take another 12 months or more at 15°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on in the greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame.",
