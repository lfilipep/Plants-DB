4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit[15]. No more details are given but the fruit is unlikely to be that inspiring, particularly when it is said that this is the least interesting fruit of the genus for birds![K]. The fruit is about 5 - 6mm in diameter[266].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,
23,Other Uses Description,"Landscape Uses: Erosion control, Espalier, Massing, Seashore. A fairly wind-tolerant shrub, it can be used in shelterbelt plantings[200].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained, moisture-retentive loamy soil[1, 200]. Succeeds in any soil that is warm and not very heavy[11]. Another report says that it grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds on chalky soils[108]. Succeeds in sun or part shade, though it does not fruit so well in a shady position[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and reasonable exposure[200]. Plants are not reliably hardy in the colder areas of Britain[219]. Susceptible to scab and fireblight[11], especially when grown on acid sandy soils[182]. Birds are less attracted to the fruit of this species than they are to other members of the genus[182]. Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Remove all the fruit flesh since this can inhibit germination[200]. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification, sow it as early in the year as possible in a cold frame[113]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of almost mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, mid-August in a cold frame[78]. Pot up in October or the following spring[78].",
