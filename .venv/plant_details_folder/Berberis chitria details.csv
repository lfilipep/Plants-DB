18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments."
19,Edible Uses Description,Fruit - raw or cooked[272]. The roasted seeds are pickled[272].
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Cancer  Dysentery  Ophthalmic  StomachicThe juice of the bark is used to treat peptic ulcers[272]. It is also boiled then filtered and used as eyedrops to treat various eye inflammations[272]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Berberis species, has marked antibacterial effects. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,A yellow dye is obtained from the roots and stems[272].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a warm moist loamy soil and light shade but it is by no means fastidious, succeeding in thin, dry and shallow soils[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[1]. There is much confusion in the naming of this species, it is frequently confused with B. aristata and it lacks a valid name[11]. The name given above is liable to be changed[11]. Plants can be pruned back quite severely and resprouts well from the base[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, when it should germinate in late winter or early spring[78]. Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate[78], whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[80]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated[113]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, preferably with a heel, October/November in a frame[78]."
