Best in a deep, gritty perfectly drained soil in full sun[200]. Strongly resents winter wet[200]. A very ornamental[1] and variable plant[235]. Plants resent root disturbance and so should be pot-grown then and planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small[200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria called Rhizobia. These bacteria form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen, plants may fail to flourish due to the absence of the appropriate Rhizobium species. Some of the nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in a greenhouse in early spring. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as the cotyledons emerge in order to avoid damage to the root. Grow them on in the greenhouse and plant them out the following spring[200]. Division in spring[1].
