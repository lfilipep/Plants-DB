Plants are hardy to about -15°c according to one report[184], whilst another says that they are not hardy at Kew although they succeed outdoors in the milder areas of Britain[11]. However, a shrub on a sunny gentle slope at Kew was 60cm tall in 1989 (planted in 1981?) and produced viable seed[K].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a greenhouse from late winter to mid summer[164]. Only just cover the seed and keep moist. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, August in a frame. Overwinter in frost-free conditions[200].",
