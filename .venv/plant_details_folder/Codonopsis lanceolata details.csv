Plants only succeed in full sun if the soil remains moist during the growing season[200]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[164]. Dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. A lot of confusion exists over the correct authorship of this specific name. Apart from the one mentioned above there are also :- (Sieb.&Zucc.)Trautv.; Benth.; and Benth.&Hook. A climbing plant, supporting itself by twining and scrambling over other plants[219]. The plant resents root disturbance and should be planted out into its permanent position as soon as possible[164]. Plants are very susceptible to the ravages of slugs. The young shoots in spring are particularly at risk, though older growth is also eaten[K]. It is best grown on a high bank in order to give a good view of the flowers[1].","Seed - surface sow in spring to early summer in an ericaceous compost in a greenhouse. Do not allow the compost to dry out. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 6 weeks at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer and protect them from slugs until the plants are well established[K]. Division in spring, with care, since the plant resents root disturbance[200]. We have found it best to take small divisions that are teased out from the sides of the main clump so as to cause the least possible disturbance to the plants and to avoid having to dig up the clump. These small divisions need to be potted up and placed in light shade in a greenhouse until they are rooting well. They can be planted out into their permanent positions in the summer if they are large enough, otherwise in the following spring[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
