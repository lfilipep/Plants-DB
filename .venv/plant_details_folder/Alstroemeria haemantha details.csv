Prefers a dry sheltered border and a peaty loam[1, 111]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. Hardy to between -10 and -15°c. The roots should be planted 15 - 20cm deep in late summer to autumn and then be well mulched to protect them from severe winter weather. This species is closely related to A. ligtu[233]. A somewhat invasive plant, spreading by means of fleshy roots to form large patches[187]. Somewhat intolerant of root disturbance[1], the roots are fleshy and brittle[200].","Seed - best sown in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe although seedlings can be transplanted successfully if they are moved with care whilst small. Pre-soak stored seed for 12 hrs in warm water, warm stratify for 4 weeks at 25°c and then reduce the temperature to 10°c. Excising a small bit of the seed near the embryo after the seed has been warm stratified helps to speed up the germination process[164]. Plant out about 20cm deep into their permanent positions in late summer or autumn[200]. Division in April or October with care since the plant resents root disturbance[133]. Ensure each portion has a growth bud[111].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
