13,Summary,"Copaifera coriacea is an evergreen tree of about 20 m in height and found near riverbanks in the rainforests in South America. The trunk of the tree produces copaiba-balsam, an oily oleo-resin which is used medicinally to counter mucous in the chest and genito-urinary system. It also improves digestion, controls bacterial infections, and has diuretic and expectorant effects. Furthermore, it has healing, anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, and antifungal properties. It can be taken internally against various respiratory, urinary tract and reproductive systems ailments. Externally, it can be used against skin conditions such as insect bites, eczema, sores, psoriasis, chilblains, wounds, and bleeding. It can also cure sore throats and tonsillitis if gargled. Aside from the abovementioned medicinal uses, the resin can also be used as a flavouring agent in food and beverages, or in varnishes and lacquers, for photographic paper, or as substitute for diesel oil."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Copaifera coriacea is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antacid  Antibacterial  Antifungal  Antiinflammatory  Antiseptic  Antitumor  Aromatic  Astringent  Cytostatic  Demulcent  Digestive  Disinfectant  Diuretic  Eczema  Expectorant  Kidney  Laxative  Skin  Stimulant  Urinary  VermifugeCopaiba-balsam, an oily oleo-resin obtained from the trunk of the tree, has a very long history of use medicinally. It was widely used by the native peoples prior to the Europeans reaching S. America and these uses were soon taken up by the Europeans[ 317 ]. The resin is especially valued for its ability to counter mucous in the chest and genito-urinary system[ 254 ]. The resin is an aromatic, stimulant herb with a bitter, burning taste[ 238 ]. Both it and the bark are anodyne, antacid, antibacterial, antifungal, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, astringent, cytostatic, demulcent, digestive, disinfectant, diuretic, expectorant, mildly laxative, vermifuge and vulnerary[ 318 ]. The resin obtained from the trunk contains a number of medically active constituents including 30 - 90% essential oils and unusual condensed tannins[ 238 ]. The essential oil contains alpha- and beta-caryophyllene, sesquiterpenes, resins and terpenic acids[ 254 ]. It improves the digestion, has diuretic and expectorant effects, and controls bacterial infections[ 238 ]. Much of the clinical research performed to date has verified the traditional uses of copaiba. It has, for instance, been shown to be highly effective as a topical wound healer and anti-inflammatory agent[ 318 ]. The anti-inflammatory effect is mainly due to the sesquiterpenes, particularly caryophyllene which has also demonstrated effective pain-relieving properties, antifungal properties against nail fungus and gastroprotective properties[ 318 ]. The resin as a whole (and, particularly, two of its diterpenes - copalic acid and kaurenic acid) has demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria. One of copaiba?s other chemicals, kaurenoic acid, has also demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in other recent studies[318. Other constituents of the resin have demonstrated significant antitumor activity[ 318 ]. The resin is taken internally in the treatment of a range of respiratory problems such as tuberculosis, bronchitis and sinusitis; urinary tract and reproductive system conditions such as cystitis, kidney and bladder infections, vaginal discharge and gonorrhoea[ 238 , 254 ]. Stomach ulcers, tetanus, herpes, pleurisy and haemorrhages are just some of the other conditions treated with the resin[ 318 ]. Externally, it is used in the treatment of a range of skin problems including insect bites, eczema, chilblains, sores and psoriasis[ 238 , 254. It is also used to treat wounds and stop bleeding[ 318 ]. As an antiseptic gargle, it is used to treat sore throats and tonsillitis[ 318 ]. The resin should be used with care, see notes above on toxicity[ 238 ]. The resin is tapped at intervals from the tree and the holes filled in afterwards[ 238 ]. It is used in infusions or distilled for its essential oil[ 238 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Lacquer: A type of varnish.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Varnish: Plants that can be used as a varnish without any special treatment. Does not include varnishes made from oils etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: An oleoresin is obtained from the tree[ 46 ]. It is used in varnishes and lacquers; for photographic paper; removing varnish from old oil paintings etc[ 46 ]. The resin can be used, direct from the tree, as a substitute for diesel oil[ 238 ]."
