13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Oryza hybrids is a PERENNIAL growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil and can grow in water.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Staple Crop: balanced carb (The term staple crop typically refers to a food that is eaten routinely and accounts for a dominant part of people's diets in a particular region of the world) [1-1]. Under development as new cereal, annual O. sativa crossed with its perennial ancestors, O. longistaminata and O. rufipogon.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.UrinaryRice is a nutritive, soothing, tonic herb that is diuretic, reduces lactation, improves digestion and controls sweating[238 ]. The seeds are taken internally in the treatment of urinary dysfunction[238 ]. The seeds, or the germinated seeds, are taken to treat excessive lactation[238 ]. The germinated seeds are used to treat poor appetite, indigestion abdominal discomfort and bloating[238 ]. The grains are often cooked with herbs to make a medicinal gruel[238 ]. The rhizome is taken internally in the treatment of night sweats, especially in cases of tuberculosis and chronic pneumonia[238 ]. The rhizomes are harvested at the end of the growing season and dried for use in decoctions[238 ].",
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"The straw, which may attain considerable length if the plant has grown in flood water, is valued for thatching[299 , 332 ]. Because they are a source of resistance to or tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses, the most important use of the various species of wild rice is probably in breeding programmes to improve the species of cultivated rice[1040 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Under Development: Plant breeders are actively working to domesticate these plants for cultivation, but they are not yet commercially available as crops. Examples include most of the perennial cereal grains.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Under DevelopmentClimate:  cold temperate to tropical, tropical highlands. Humidity: humid, aquatic. Succeeds in full sun and in moderate shade[1040]. Requires a wet soil or shallow water[1040].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. The seed of wild rice less than 12 months old often exhibits strong dormancy, which implies (though this has not been established) that the seed retains its viability for a considerable period[1040 ]. Heat treatment is generally effective in breaking dormancy - alternating temperatures between 34°c for 16 hours then 11°c for 8 hours is usually effective, though the time taken varies between species[1040 ]. Surface sow the seed in light shade and do not allow to dry out. Seed should germinate within 7 days at 30°c[1040 ]. Prick out 2 - 3 seedlings into individual pots when large enough to handle and, after a few days, move to a sunny position. Grow on until large enough to plant out. Division.",
