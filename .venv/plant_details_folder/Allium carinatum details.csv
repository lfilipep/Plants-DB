18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Bulb - raw or cooked[22]. The bulb is very small, about 15mm tall and 10mm in diameter[203, 235]. Leaves - raw or cooked. Flowers - raw. Bulbils - raw or cooked. Rather small and fiddly to use, but they have a fairly pleasant onion/garlic flavour[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention of medicinal uses has been seen for this species, members of this genus are in general very healthy additions to the diet. They contain sulphur compounds (which give them their onion flavour) and when added to the diet on a regular basis they help reduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the digestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[K]."
22,Other Uses,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1]. Succeeds in clay soils[203]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Most members of this genus are intolerant of competition from other growing plants[203]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. A good plant for the wild garden[42]. This species can become very invasive by means of its bulbils[203]. The sub-species A. carinatum pulchellum Bonnier.&Layens. is much better behaved and makes a good garden plant[203]. Closely allied to A. oleraceum[1]. Produces new growth in early autumn[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. Very easy, the plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season and the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required. Bulbils are harvested in late summer and can be planted out immediately in situ or stored and planted out in spring."
