See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",C. japonica.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw[1, 2, 105, 177. 179. 183]. The fruit is up to 8mm in diameter[266]. We have no further information, but the fruit is liable to consist of a thin, sweet, though dry and mealy flesh around a large seed[K]. Leaves - cooked[105, 177, 179, 183]. The leaves are used as a tea substitute[177, 183].",Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.MiscellanyThe root bark is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, poor appetite, shortness of breath and swollen feet[218].",Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,None known,,"Succeeds in any reasonably good soil, preferring a good fertile well-drained loamy soil[1, 11, 200]. Succeeds on dry gravels and on sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Trees prefer hotter summers and more sunlight than are normally experienced in Britain, they often do not fully ripen their wood when growing in this country and they are then very subject to die-back in winter[1, 11, 200]. Trees can be very long-lived, perhaps to 1000 years[200]. This species is closely allied to C. bungeana[11]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed is best given 2 - 3 months cold stratification and then sown February/March in a greenhouse[78, 200]. Germination rates are usually good, though the stored seed might take 12 months or more to germinate. The seed can be stored for up to 5 years[113]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. The leaves of seedlings often have a lot of white patches without chlorophyll, this is normal and older plants produce normal green leaves. Grow the seedlings on in a cold frame for their first winter, and plant them out in the following late spring or early summer[K]. Give them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
