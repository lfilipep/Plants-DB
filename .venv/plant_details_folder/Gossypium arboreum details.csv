See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant is not wind tolerant.",Gossypium nanking Meyen. Gossypium obtusifolium Roxb. ex G.Don,,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","ves[301 ]. The seeds contain a large amount of oil, which can be used as a substitute for olive oil[272 , 301 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The juice of the root is used in the treatment of fevers[272].,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.","The floss contained in the seedpods is used for making cloth and for the wicks of oil lamps[272 ]. Cotton fibres have a wide range of used including making clothes; rubber-tyre fabrics; stuffing material for pillows, cushions etc; surgical dressings; making twine and ropes; carpets etc[46 ]. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: fiber.","Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).","Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilTree cotton can be grown in the dry to moist tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,600 metres. For commercial production it requires a climate that has a long, hot growing season with abundant moisture, followed by a drier period for harvesting the seed floss[200 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 26 - 36°c, but can tolerate 18 - 38°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 750 - 1,250mm, but tolerates 500 - 1,500mm[418 ]. Prefers a very sunny position in a light, fertile, well-drained soil[200 ]. Plants can tolerate a range of soils, including moderate levels of salt[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7.2, tolerating 5.3 - 8.5[418 ]. Requires a position sheltered from strong winds[418 ]. There are two main forms of the plant:- var. Neglecta produces very short fibres[46 ]. Var. Sanguinea produces strong, good quality fibre[46 ]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard, coppice. Perennial cotton has longer fibres and is considered superior to annual cottons. Perennial cottons are suited to arid and humid conditions while annual cottons were bred for colder climates and for mechanical harvesting. Perennial cottons are cultivated in the tropics on a smaller scale and include Gossypium arboreum burmanicum, Gossypium arboreum indicum, Gossypium arboreum soudanense, Gossypium barbadense braziliense, Gossypium barbadense darwinii, Gossypium herbaceum acerifolium, Gossypium herbaceum africanum, Gossypium hirsutum marie-galante, Gossypium hirsutum punctatum, Gossypium hirsutum taitense. Currently perennial cottons are harvested by hand. Researching perennial cottons varieties and production methods would help develop them as good carbon farming plants and help to alleviate the terrible problems caused by annual cottons.",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
