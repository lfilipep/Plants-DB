18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Bulb - raw or cooked[46, 61, 62, 177]. It can be used as a vegetable, or as a flavouring in soups and stews, and can also be pickled[2]. The bulb is up to 30mm in diameter, it is crisp, mild and with a pleasant flavour[183]. Used as a leek substitute according to one report[22], it is a garlic substitute according to others[55, 159, K]. Leaves - raw or cooked[55, 62, 177]. A delicious mild flavour, they are available from early spring until the autumn[K]. They make a very acceptable salad and can also be used as a greens or as a flavouring in cooked foods[K]. Flowers - raw. A little bit stronger flavour than the leaves, especially as the seeds begin to form, they can be used as a flavouring and garnish on salads[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiasthmatic  Carminative  Cathartic  Diuretic  Expectorant  StimulantThe plant is antiasthmatic, carminative, cathartic, diuretic, expectorant and stimulant[257]. A tincture is used to prevent worms and colic in children, and also as a remedy for croup[257]. Although no other specific mention of medicinal uses has been seen for this species, members of this genus are in general very healthy additions to the diet. They contain sulphur compounds (which give them their onion flavour) and when added to the diet on a regular basis they help reduce blood cholesterol levels, act as a tonic to the digestive system and also tonify the circulatory system[K].",
22,Other Uses,"Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,The juice of the plant is used as a moth repellent. The whole plant is said to repel insects and moles[20].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a sunny position in a light well-drained soil[1]. A moisture loving plant according to another report[42]. The bulbs should be planted fairly deeply[1]. Bulbs grow to a good size under cultivation[183]. Some forms of this species produce many bulbils and are considered to be a pernicious weed in some areas of America[159], there is some risk that they could spread aggressively in Britain. This subspecies, however, is a form that does not produce bulbils and is much better behaved[200]. Grows well with most plants, especially roses, carrots, beet and chamomile, but it inhibits the growth of legumes[18, 20, 54]. This plant is a bad companion for alfalfa, each species negatively affecting the other[201]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle - if you want to produce clumps more quickly then put three plants in each pot. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in spring once they are growing vigorously and are large enough. Division in spring. Very easy, the plants divide successfully at any time in the growing season and the divisions can be planted straight out into their permanent positions if required.",
