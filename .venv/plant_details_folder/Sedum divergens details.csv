See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Cultivated Beds;,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked[172, 177]. The leaves are very small and round, looking rather like a small green berry[256]. They have a crisp texture and were valued as a food by some North American Indian tribes who would eat them raw[256].","Antihaemorrhoidal: Treats haemorrhoids (piles).

Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species, such as this one, that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].","Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
