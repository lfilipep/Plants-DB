24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained humus-rich sandy loam in a shady protected position[200]. It requires a sunny wall according to another report[182], whilst others say that it succeeds in sun or semi-shade[188, 219]. A very ornamental plant[1], but it is only hardy in the mildest areas of Britain tolerating occasional lows to -10°c[184]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. The fruits are only formed in this country after a long hot summer[166, 219]. Plants climb by means of twining[182], they do not really need pruning[219]. The flowers can be monoecious or dioecious. Male and female flowers are carried on the same plants[188]. The edible fruit is sold in the local markets in Chile and Peru[46]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in early summer and, if possible, give the plants some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm long with a heel, June/July in a frame[78]. The cuttings should be put in individual pots[78]. A good percentage[78]. Stem cuttings in spring and autumn[200]."
