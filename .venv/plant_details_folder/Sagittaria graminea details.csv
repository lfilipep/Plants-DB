Prefers shallow, still or slowly flowing water up to 30 - 60cm deep. The edible roots are commonly found in Chinese markets[183]. There is some confusion over this name. The report that this plant is edible gives the name as S. sinensis and its range as Asia. However, the RHS Dictionary of Gardening says that S. sinensis is a synonym of S. graminea and that its range is Eastern N. America[200], whilst other reports say that it is a synonym of S. sagittifolia or S. trifolia[266]. The Flora of N. America says that S. graminea does not produce corms but has coarse rhizomes[270], which suggests that the report of edibility does not really belong here[K].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a pot standing in about 5cm of water. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and gradually increase the depth of water as the plants grow until it is about 5cm above the top of the pot.
