22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a sunny position in most well-drained soils[200], growing well even in maritime exposure[11]. This species is very closely related to B. greyi, but is somewhat hardier, tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[11, 200]. It does well in the mild areas of Britain but it is not hardy at Kew[11]. A very ornamental plant[1]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Only just cover the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Overwinter in a cold frame and plant out in late spring[78]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 8cm preferably with a heel, October/November in a cold frame. High percentage. Plant out in late spring[78]."
