Another report says that it is shade tolerant[157]. Does not thrive in very cold, dry or exposed positions[154, 200]. This species is only hardy in sheltered maritime gardens, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[184]. It grows very well in the mild maritime areas of the country, there is a tree 16 metres tall in Cornwall[11].","Seed - sow February in a greenhouse. The seed should be stored cool and dry over the winter. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a heel, June/July in individual pots in a frame. Roots in 5 - 6 weeks. A variable percentage succeed[78]. Layering in late summer. Takes 16 months. High percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
