4,Known Hazards,"The leaves and stems, if put in water, can stupefy fish[ 303 ]. This possibly means they contain saponins[ K ]. Although poisonous, saponins are poorly absorbed by the human body and so most pass through without harm. Saponins are quite bitter and can be found in many common foods such as some beans. They can be removed by carefully leaching in running water. Thorough cooking, and perhaps changing the cooking water once, will also normally remove most of them. However, it is not advisable to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[ K ]."
5,Habitats,"Open pine forests and grassy savannahs, sometimes in extensive stands[ 303 ]. Lowland moist or dry thickets and woodland[ 307 ]."

13,Summary,"Golden Spoon, Byrsonima crassifolia, is a large shrub or tree that grows up to 10 m with a bole diameter of 15 to 25 cm. It is slow-growing, drought-tolerant, and deciduous. It is cultivated in Northern South America. The bark is rich in tannins and is used as a treatment for gastrointestinal problems, pulmonary concerns, snakebites, fevers, leucorrhoea, and to promote menstruation. It is also applied externally to wounds, ulcers, and skin infections. The leaves are also used against ulcers and high blood pressure. The orange-yellow round fruit of Golden Spoon is consumed raw/fresh or cooked as dessert. It can be fermented to yield 'chicha', a refreshing drink famous in Panama. Unripe fruits, on the other hand, are used in dyeing. The bark is a source of fibre. The wood is heavy, hard, tough, and moderately durable. It yields a pleasant odour when burned."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Byrsonima crassifolia is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Birds. It is noted for attracting wildlife.

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Trees succeed in tropical and subtropical climates up to elevations of 1,000 metres[ 303 ]. They are tolerant of a wide range of environments, from humid tropical lowlands to semi-desert regions[ 303 ]. The tree is often found on rocky ground. It grows well on sandy and alkaline-sandy soils[ 303 ]. Although it succeeds in poor soils, better yields are achieved when a good supply of organic matter is added. Grows best in a fertile, well-drained soil[ 307 ]. Established plants are highly drought tolerant[ 303 , 307 ]. Plants are very tolerant of salt laden winds[ 307 ]. Very often, when the forest is cleared this tree is left and allowed to grow in a state of semi-wild cultivation[ 303 ]. A fire-resistant tree[ 303 ]. A very variable species with a wide distribution in tropical America[ 307 ]. It has sometimes been recognised as more than one species[ 307 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A germination rate of less than 30% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 25 - 35 days[ 625 ]. The seeds are collected from ripe fruit are the flesh removed by allowing them to partly decompose in a plastic bag. The pulp is removed under running water. Seeds need to be planted fresh. They are best in light shade."
