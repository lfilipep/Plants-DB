19,Edible Uses Description,"Spores - cooked[144]. A source of starch, the spores can be ground into a powder and used like flour[154]. They are astringent and highly indigestible[154]. The spores are contained in a sporocarp[154]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Plants are hardy to about -7°c in Australian gardens[157], though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Spores. The plant produces sporocarps, these need to be lightly abraded and then immersed in water. The sporocarps will then swell and burst to release the spores. The spores germinate immediately, the highly developed prothallus remains inside the large seed-like spores. The gametophyte generation is completed in 24 hours and the first roots and shoots appear in 2 - 3 days. Mature plants bearing sporocarps can develop in as little as 3 months[200]. Spore germination in the family occurs after rupture of the sporocarp wall allows the sporocarp contents to be hydrated. A gelatinous structure emerges from the sporocarp, breaking it into valves and carrying the sori into the water. Spore germination (gametophyte growth) and fertilization occur immediately[270].
