13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Campanula portenschlagiana is an evergreen Perennial growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[K]. The leaves are rather small, but they are produced all year round[K]. They have a mild flavour and make an acceptable ingredient in mixed salads, especially in the winter, but we find that, eaten in quantity, they become a bit unpleasant[K]. Flowers - raw. Very freely produced, they have a pleasant flavour and make a very decorative addition to salads[K].",

22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"A rampantly spreading plant, suitable for ground cover in a sunny position[197, 208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moist but well-drained rich sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil preferring full sun but also succeeding in partial shade[1, 200, 208]. This species prefers a slightly shaded position[221]. Plants can be grown on a dry stone wall[200] and succeed in poor soils[221]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile[221]. A rampant plant, capable of spreading widely when in suitable conditions by means of both underground roots and long stems above ground [188, 271]. It makes a good ground cover but can become a nuisance if it is not sited with care[200]. It is, however, fairly easy to control by simply pulling up any parts of the plant that wander too far[271]. There are several named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, the plant can be divided at almost any time of the year[221].",
