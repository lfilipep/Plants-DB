19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[177]. A very mild flavour with a mucilaginous texture, they make a very acceptable part of a mixed salad, or a good filling for a salad sandwich, though they are somewhat boring on their own[K]. The cooked leaf has a rather slimy texture[K]. Seed - raw. Best used before it is fully mature, the seed has a pleasant nutty taste but it is rather small and fiddly to harvest[K]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, succeeding in ordinary garden soil[1], though it prefers a reasonably well-drained and moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Plants are prone to infestation by rust fungus[200]. This species is closely related to M. sylvestris[50]. Plants growing in an open sunny position in the Order Beds at Cambridge Botanical gardens are very similar to M. sylvestris and, like that species, are clearly perennial even though we have read reports that they are annual[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow early spring in situ. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.
