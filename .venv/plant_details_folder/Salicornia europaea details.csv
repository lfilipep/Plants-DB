0,Salicornia europaea,Glasswort,Chenopodiaceae,Coming soon,None known,"Coastal sands, mudflats and salt marshes, often near the low tide mark[9, 17].","Coasts of western Europe, including Britain.",(3 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalicorniaEuropaea.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalicorniaEuropaea2.jpg",,"Salicornia europaea is a ANNUAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  It is in flower in August, and the seeds ripen in September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",S. herbacea,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Shoots: ","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","ng stems - raw or cooked as a potherb, added to soups etc[5, 13, 52, 62, 183]. The plant is at its best for eating in late summer[264]. The stems are very succulent, but have a thin woody core that is easily removed[264, K]. They are best harvested when about 15cm long, the top 10cm being used leaving the bottom 5cm to produce new shoots[264]. They require little cooking, just adding them to a soup for the last few minutes of cooking is sufficient[9]. The plant has a salty flavour[183] and makes a very pleasant raw nibble[K]. The young shoots can be pickled after first boiling them in their own salted water[183]. Seed[105]. Rich in protein[183]. The seed is rather small and fiddly to utilize[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. A high quality, it is similar to safflower oil (Carthamnus tinctoria)[183].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,"Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Potash: Used for making glass, soap and as a fertilizer.","The ashes obtained from burning this plant are rich in potash and are used in making soap or glass[4, 6, 13, 46, 61]. The ashes can also be used as a soap.",,"Prefers a rich organic soil with ample nitrogen and regular watering[264]. This species is little, if at all, cultivated and its exact requirements are not clearly understood[264]. It is not known if the plant will require periodic inundation by salty water to grow well[264]. Glasswort is difficult to grow in cultivation[52, 264], it can succeed in gardens if sown as soon as the seed is ripe in the autumn in a well-drained soil[52]. A very variable plant both in size and the number of branches produced - a number of subspecies are recognised[264]. The best forms for food production are bushy plants up to 40cm tall with an upright habit that keeps the branches out of the mud[264]. The form sometimes classed as a distinct species (as S. ramosissima Woods.) has this habit and habitat and so is the best form for using in cultivation experiments[264]. When seeking seed for cultivation, try to collect from plants with this habit and also choose plants nearer the high tide mark that therefore receive less inundation[264]. The edible leaves are occasionally sold in local markets[46].",Seed - best sown in situ as soon as ripe in a well-drained outdoor bed[52].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
