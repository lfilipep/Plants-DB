19,Edible Uses Description,"ng stems - raw or cooked as a potherb, added to soups etc[5, 13, 52, 62, 183]. The plant is at its best for eating in late summer[264]. The stems are very succulent, but have a thin woody core that is easily removed[264, K]. They are best harvested when about 15cm long, the top 10cm being used leaving the bottom 5cm to produce new shoots[264]. They require little cooking, just adding them to a soup for the last few minutes of cooking is sufficient[9]. The plant has a salty flavour[183] and makes a very pleasant raw nibble[K]. The young shoots can be pickled after first boiling them in their own salted water[183]. Seed[105]. Rich in protein[183]. The seed is rather small and fiddly to utilize[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. A high quality, it is similar to safflower oil (Carthamnus tinctoria)[183]."

22,Other Uses,"Cleanser: For various materials. Perhaps best included under separate headings.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Potash: Used for making glass, soap and as a fertilizer."
23,Other Uses Description,"The ashes obtained from burning this plant are rich in potash and are used in making soap or glass[4, 6, 13, 46, 61]. The ashes can also be used as a soap."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich organic soil with ample nitrogen and regular watering[264]. This species is little, if at all, cultivated and its exact requirements are not clearly understood[264]. It is not known if the plant will require periodic inundation by salty water to grow well[264]. Glasswort is difficult to grow in cultivation[52, 264], it can succeed in gardens if sown as soon as the seed is ripe in the autumn in a well-drained soil[52]. A very variable plant both in size and the number of branches produced - a number of subspecies are recognised[264]. The best forms for food production are bushy plants up to 40cm tall with an upright habit that keeps the branches out of the mud[264]. The form sometimes classed as a distinct species (as S. ramosissima Woods.) has this habit and habitat and so is the best form for using in cultivation experiments[264]. When seeking seed for cultivation, try to collect from plants with this habit and also choose plants nearer the high tide mark that therefore receive less inundation[264]. The edible leaves are occasionally sold in local markets[46]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - best sown in situ as soon as ripe in a well-drained outdoor bed[52].
