It is closely related to, and possibly no more than part of, R. dahuricus. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any reasonably good soil[11]. The species in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed will require 1 - 2 months cold stratification at about 5° and should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame or outdoor seedbed[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, autumn in a frame.
