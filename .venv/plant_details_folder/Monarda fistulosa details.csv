19,Edible Uses Description,"eaLeaves - raw or cooked. The entire plant above ground level can be used as a potherb[183], though it is rather aromatic. It is also used as a flavouring in salads and cooked foods[46, 105, 183, 213]. The flowers make an attractive edible garnish in salads[183]. The fresh or dried leaves are brewed into a refreshing aromatic tea[183, 257]."

Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Pectoral  StimulantWild bergamot was often employed medicinally by several native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a variety of complaints, but especially those connected with the digestive system[257]. It is still sometimes used in modern herbalism. The leaves and flowering stems are carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic and stimulant[4, 222]. An infusion is used internally in the treatment of colds, catarrh, headaches, gastric disorders, aching kidneys, to reduce low fevers and soothe sore throats[213, 238, 257]. Externally, it is applied as a poultice to skin eruptions, cuts etc and as a wash for sore eyes[238, 257]. The leaves can be harvested before the plant flowers, or they can be harvested with the flowering stems. They can be used fresh or dried[238]. The plant contains the essential oil 'bergamot oil' which can be inhaled to treat bronchial complaints[213]. The leaves also contain 'thymol', an essential oil that can be used to expel gas from the digestive tract[213]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Massing. Easily grown in ordinary garden soil so long as it is not too dry[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Requires a moist soil and a sunny position[1, 200], though it also succeeds in light shade[187]. This species thrives when grown in a dry soil[233, 238, K]. It prefers alkaline soil conditions[238]. Plants are hardy to at least -25°c[187]. A very ornamental plant, there are several named varieties[1, 233]. A good bee plant[200]. Subject to mildew in dry summers[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow mid to late spring in a cold frame. Germination usually takes place within 10 - 40 days at 20°c. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer. The seed can also be sown in situ in late summer in areas where the winters are not too severe and will produce larger plants. Cuttings of soft basal shoots in spring. Harvest the shoots with plenty of underground stem when they are about 8 - 10cm above the ground. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer."
