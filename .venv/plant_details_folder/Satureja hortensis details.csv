The plant has a milder action than the closely related winter savory, S. montana[254]. The whole herb, and especially the flowering shoots, is antiseptic, aromatic, carminative, digestive, expectorant and stomachic[4, 7, 14, 21].

It prefers growing in an alkaline soil[200] but is not too fussy. It is very intolerant of soils that remain damp and dislikes shade[200]. Summer savory is often grown as a culinary herb. It is a good companion plant in the garden, where it helps to repel insect pests and grows especially well with onions and beans[14, 18, 20]. A fast-growing plant, it can be harvested within 2 months of sowing the seed[244]. If cut back as the flower buds appear, it will produce a fresh flush of leaves[1]. Summer savory seeds can prevent the germination of nearby seeds[201]. The leaves have an aromatic fragrance[245]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[7, 14]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",Seed - sow April in situ and only just cover[1]. Germinates in about 2 weeks.
