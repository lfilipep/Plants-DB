It prefers growing in an alkaline soil[200] but is not too fussy. It is very intolerant of soils that remain damp and dislikes shade[200]. Summer savory is often grown as a culinary herb. It is a good companion plant in the garden, where it helps to repel insect pests and grows especially well with onions and beans[14, 18, 20]. A fast-growing plant, it can be harvested within 2 months of sowing the seed[244]. If cut back as the flower buds appear, it will produce a fresh flush of leaves[1]. Summer savory seeds can prevent the germination of nearby seeds[201]. The leaves have an aromatic fragrance[245]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[7, 14]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow April in situ and only just cover[1]. Germinates in about 2 weeks. The plant strongly resents root disturbance so do not transplant it. In areas with mild winters an autumn sowing will provide an earlier supply of leaves[200].,
