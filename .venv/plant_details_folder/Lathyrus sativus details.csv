0,Lathyrus sativus,"Chickling Pea, White pea",Fabaceae or Leguminosae,Coming soon,"The seed contains a toxic amino-acid which, in large quantities, can cause a very serious disease of the nervous system known as 'lathyrism'. The seed is said to be perfectly safe and very nutritious in small quantities, but should not comprise more than 30% of the diet[65, 76].","Found as a weed of cultivated land though this is as a relict of cultivation, the plant is not known in a truly wild state[93].","The original habitat is obscure, possibly S. Europe.",(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LathyrusSativus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LathyrusSativus2.jpg",,"Lathyrus sativus is a ANNUAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft).  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.,Shoots: ",,"The immature seed can be eaten like green peas[2, 27, 183]. The mature seed is eaten cooked[2, 27, 46, 183]. It needs to be soaked and well cooked before being eaten[61]. The seed can also be ground into a powder and mixed with wheat in a ratio of one part vetch to 3 parts of wheat flour to make a protein-enhanced bread[2, 183]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Young seedpods - cooked[105, 142, 183]. Young shoots - cooked[142, 183].",Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CatharticThe oil from the seeds is a powerful and dangerous cathartic[240].,"Green manure: Fast-growing plants that can be used to increase the fertility of the soil.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",The plant has an extensive root system and fixes atmospheric nitrogen through bacteria that live on the roots. It makes a good soil-enriching green manure crop or can be planted for erosion control[200].,,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good garden soil but preferring a position in full sun[200]. The chickling pea is cultivated for its edible seed in India and the Middle East[61], but see notes above on toxicity. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen.","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed, then it can also be sown in situ in mid spring[200]. Division in spring. It may not transplant well so care should be taken[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
