Intolerant of water logging[200], strongly disliking winter wet[1]. Most reports say that this species is not hardy in Britain, requiring greenhouse protection[1, 200], but one report says that a plant outdoors at Boslewick in Cornwall produces fruit[59]. Plants are sometimes cultivated for their edible fruit[183]. All parts of the plant are aromatic. The white flowers have a scent of orange blossom[245]. The leaves are covered in pellucid dots and release a resinous scent when bruised[245]. The fruits are lemon-scented[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a warm greenhouse as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. Otherwise sow the seed in early spring in a warm greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors."
