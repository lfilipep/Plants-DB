22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a deep well-drained sandy soil rich in organic matter in full sun[200]. Plants require a dry period when they become dormant in the summer and they also dislike winter wet[218]. Hardy to at least -15°c[200]. Plants are attractive to slugs and need to be protected from them[200]. Very sensitive to root disturbance, the bulbs can take some years to become well established[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse and should germinate in the spring[200]. Sow the seed thinly so that it does not need to be disturbed for its first year of growth. Give an occasional liquid feed during the growing season to ensure the plants do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs when the plants become dormant, placing 2 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another 2 years in the greenhouse before planting them out when they are dormant. Division of offsets in the dormant season[200].",
