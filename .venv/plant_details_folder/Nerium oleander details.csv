0,Nerium oleander,"Oleander, Rose Bay",Apocynaceae,9-11,"The whole plant is very poisonous[1, 19, 65]. Skin contact with the plant can cause irritation whilst ingestion of only one leaf has led to death in children[200, 274]. Death has been known to follow the use of the wood of this plant as a meat skewer[200].",River banks and river gravels in Europe[50].,S.W. Europe to E.

It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",N. indica.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cancer  Cardiotonic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Emetic  Expectorant  Leprosy  Parasiticide  Resolvent  Skin  SternutatoryThe leaves and the flowers are cardiotonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant and sternutatory[7, 147, 218]. A decoction of the leaves has been applied externally in the treatment of scabies[7], and to reduce swellings[240]. This is a very poisonous plant, containing a powerful cardiac toxin[240], and should only be used with extreme caution[7, 147]. The root is powerfully resolvent. Because of its poisonous nature it is only used externally. It is beaten into a paste with water and applied to chancres and ulcers on the penis[240]. An oil prepared from the root bark is used in the treatment of leprosy and skin diseases of a scaly nature[240]. The whole plant is said to have anticancer properties[218].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.","The plant is used as a rat poison[46], a parasiticide[7] and an insecticide[100]. The pounded leaves and bark are used as an insecticide[272]. A green dye is obtained from the flowers[168]. The plant is commonly used for informal hedging in the Mediterranean[89, 200], though it is too tender for this use in Britain[K]. The leaves contain small amounts of latex that can be used to make rubber[227], though the amount is too small for commercial utilization[K]. The plants have an extensive root system and are often used to stabilize soil in warmer areas[148].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Hedge, Massing, Screen, Standard, Seashore, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a heavy soil[49]. Prefers a light soil according to another report[202]. Requires a position in full sun[49, 184]. Prefers a fertile well-drained soil[200]. Lime tolerant[200, 202]. Plants are very tolerant of heat and also of drought once they are established[166]. Grows well in maritime gardens, tolerating salt-laden winds[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though plants tolerate temperatures down to -5°c and short periods of temperatures down to -10°c[184, 200, 260]. A popular greenhouse pot plant that can be grown outdoors in the summer, it can be grown outdoors all year round in the milder areas such as Cornwall[1, 260]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200, 260]. Plants are shy to flower when grown outdoors[49, 59]. The flowers have a soft sweet perfume[245]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[113]. Do not use seed from pods infected with the bacterial disease 'oleander knot'[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter before planting them out in early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, August/September in a frame. Good percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature leading shoots[1].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
