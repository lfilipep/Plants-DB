See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.,Smilacena borealis.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade;,Leaves: ,,"Young leaves - raw or cooked[61, 105, 177]. Harvested in spring before they fully unfurl[62], they have a slightly sweetish cucumber flavour[55, 183]. Older leaves can be used as a potherb[55].","Cardiac: Used in the treatment of heart problems.,Disinfectant: Used for cleaning wounds.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cardiac  Disinfectant  PoulticeThe leaves are cardiac and disinfectant[257]. A poultice has been applied to open wounds, burns, ulcers, scrofulous sores and infections[257].","Disinfectant: Plants used for disinfecting.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.",The crushed leaves have been rubbed on the face and hands as a protection from mosquitoes[257].,,"Prefers a damp peaty sandy soil in a cool damp shady position[1, 42, 200]. Requires a moist neutral to acid soil[200]. The dormant plant is hardy to at least -25°c, but new growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts[187]. Plants only produce their fruit in warm seasons in Britain[200]. They have creeping underground stems and form dense colonies[187]. This species is closely related to C. andrewsiana[188]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it usually germinates in the spring[200]. Stored seed should be sown in late winter or early spring in a cold frame[164]. It sometimes germinates within 1 - 3 months at 15°c, but may take a year. The seed should be completely separated from the fruit and should only just be covered by soil[164, 200]. If the seed has been sown thinly enough, then it is possible to leave the seedlings in the pot for their first growing season, dividing them after they become dormant. Make sure to give them liquid feeds at intervals through the spring and summer. Otherwise prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in late spring or early summer at the beginning of their second or third years growth. Division in spring as new growth is just commencing[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
