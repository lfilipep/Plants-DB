Caraway is also used as a breath freshener.",,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil as long as it is not too wet in winter[1]. Prefers a moist soil in full sun or partial shade[4, 200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.8 to 7.6. Caraway is a well-known herb that has been cultivated for its culinary and medicinal uses since ancient times[244]. It is frequently cultivated in the modern herb garden and sometimes also commercially[4, 46], there are some named varieties[183]. Plants growing in more northerly latitudes and also in full sun are richer in essential oils and therefore more aromatic[4, 245]. Plants strongly resent root disturbance[200]. They often self-sow freely when in a suitable location[244]. This species is deep rooted[201] and is a good plant for breaking up the sub-soil on heavy, wet land[18, 20]. It dislikes growing near fennel or wormwood[14, 20] but is a good companion for most plants, especially those that are shallow-rooted[201]. The flowers attract parasitic wasps to the garden, these prey on aphids and so help to reduce populations of insect pests[238].","Seed - it is best sown in situ as soon as it is ripe in late summer and early autumn[4, 200]. The seed can also be sown March/April in situ[200], though in areas with cool summers the plants might not produce a crop of ripe seeds[238]. Plants are very sensitive to root disturbance and should not be transplanted.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
