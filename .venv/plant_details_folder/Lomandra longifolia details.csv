The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Beetles.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",,"Flowers - raw. A flavour of fresh peas. Both sexes are used though the male flowers are easier to harvest[144]. White leaf bases - raw[193].

Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","The leaves contain a tough fibre and they are used in basket making and in weaving[154, 193]. This fibre can also be made into a string[156].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. It succeeds in most soils and aspects in Australian gardens, also tolerating occasional flooding[157], and it also withstands temperatures down to at least -7°c in that country[157]. However, this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Other members of this genus are also said to have edible flowers[144, 193]. The flowers are rich in a heavy-smelling nectar and this attracts pollinating beetles[193]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter or early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors.
