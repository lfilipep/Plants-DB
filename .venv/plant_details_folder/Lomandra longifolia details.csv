24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain. It succeeds in most soils and aspects in Australian gardens, also tolerating occasional flooding[157], and it also withstands temperatures down to at least -7°c in that country[157]. However, this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Other members of this genus are also said to have edible flowers[144, 193]. The flowers are rich in a heavy-smelling nectar and this attracts pollinating beetles[193]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in late winter or early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Division might also be possible."
