14,Physical Characteristics,"Aquilegia canadensis is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.6 m (2ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Flowers - raw. Sweet and delightful[172]. Rich in nectar[213], they make a very attractive addition to mixed salads and can also be used as a thirst-quenching munch in the garden[K]. Root[2, 105, 177]. These reports possibly refer to the root being chewed for its medicinal virtues[K]. Caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity[172].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Resolvent: Breaks down tumors. This might be placed under antitumor.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antispasmodic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Parasiticide  Parasiticide  Resolvent  SalveAntispasmodic, diaphoretic, parasiticide, resolvent, salve[172, 222]. The root is astringent and diuretic[222, 257]. It is chewed or made into a weak tea for the treatment of diarrhoea and stomach aches[222]. The tea is used in the treatment of uterine bleeding[222]. The boiled plant was used as a hair wash[213]. The seed is anodyne and febrifuge[257]. An infusion is used in the treatment of headaches and fevers[257].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The seed is rubbed into the scalp to rid the hair of lice[172, 222]. The crushed seed is pleasantly aromatic and is used as a perfume. The fragrance persists for a long time[207].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. An easily grown and very tolerant plant[K], it succeeds in ordinary garden soil, preferring a moist but not wet soil and a sunny position[1]. Intolerant of heavy clay[200]. Does well in semi-shade[111]. Prefers a rather poor slightly acid soil[111]. A very ornamental and cold-hardy plant, it tolerates temperatures down to about -25°c[1,187]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. Plants are pollinated by humming birds in the wild[187]. Most species in this genus are short-lived, dying out after 2 - 3 years, though they usually produce seed prolifically[200]. However, they are very apt to hybridize with other members of the genus and so it becomes difficult to keep a species true to type if more than one is grown in the garden[200].  Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. The seed can be slow to germinate[200]. Stored seed can be sown in late winter in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring[200].",
