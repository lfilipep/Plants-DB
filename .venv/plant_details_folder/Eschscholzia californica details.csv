21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antianxiety  Antidepressant  Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Galactofuge  OdontalgicThe Californian poppy is a bitter sedative herb that acts as a diuretic, relieves pain, relaxes spasms and promotes perspiration[238]. The whole plant is harvested when in flower and dried for use in tinctures and infusions[238]. It is taken internally in the treatment of nervous tension, anxiety, insomnia and incontinence (especially in children)[238]. The watery sap is mildly narcotic and has been used to relieve toothache[238]. It is similar in its effect to the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) but is much milder in its action and does not depress the central nervous system[238]. Another report says that it has a markedly different effect upon the central nervous system, that it is not a narcotic but tends to normalize psychological function[254]. Its gently antispasmodic, sedative and analgesic actions make it a valuable herbal medicine for treating physical and psychological problems in children[254]. It may also prove beneficial in attempts to overcome bedwetting, difficulty in sleeping and nervous tension and anxiety[254]. An extract of the root is used as a wash on the breasts to suppress the flow of milk in lactating females[207, 257].",

25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden. Prefers a poor sandy soil and a sunny position[108, 200] but is easily grown in an ordinary garden soil[1]. Succeeds in a hot dry position. Plants grow well in maritime climates[200]. A very ornamental plant, it is commonly grown in the flower garden and there are many named varieties[200]. This plant is the state flower of California[207]. Although a perennial it is usually quite short-lived and is more often grown as an annual in this country[187, 238]. It can tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c, however, and often survives mild winters[187]. If the dead flowers are removed before they set seed the plant will continue flowering for a longer period[188]. A polymorphic species[71]. Plants resent root disturbance and should be sown in situ[200]. The flowers are very attractive to bees[108]. They close during wet or overcast weather[238]. Plants often self-sow if the soil is disturbed by some means such as hoeing[200]. Special Features: Attractive foliage, North American native, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers, Extended bloom season in Zones 9A and above. Heat Zone: 9-2.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in mid spring or late summer to early autumn in a sunny border outdoors and only just cover the seed[200]. Autumn sown plants may require protection from frosts in cold winters[200]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 3 weeks.,
