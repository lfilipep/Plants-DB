0,Microcycas calocoma,Palma corcho,Cycadaceae,10-12,Roots are poisonous.,Varied habitats ranging from montane forest at 250 meters to lowland limestone or grassland and scrub at 50 meters.,Origin: Cuba.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Full shade,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Microcycas_calocoma1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Microcycas_calocoma2.JPEG",Microcycas calocoma is one of the most ancient cycad species. It is endemic to a small area in western Cuba in Pinar del Río Province. Critically Endangered in the wild. The plants are affected by habitat destruction (moderate) and over collecting of plants from the wild.,"Microcycas calocoma is an evergreen Perennial growing to 10 m (32ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Zamia calocoma Miq.,,None Known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known,,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: starch (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]. Genera to investigate include: Cycas, Dioon, Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Microcycas, and Zamia [1-1]. Nearly all cycads fix low amounts of nitrogen. Ornamental - Landscape Uses: Specimen. An ornamental plant.","Hypothetical Crop: These are perennial plants that could potentially be developed for cultivation. Some, such as cycads (for industrial starch), as simply neglected; others, such as buckwheat and soybeans, are annual crops that could potentially be perennialised by crossing and relatives.,Industrial Crop: Starch: Materials and chemicals include bioplastics, paper, cardboard, solvents, paints, glues etc. Plants are usually pods, starchy fruits, nuts & seeds, starchy trunks.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.","Hypothetical Crop  Industrial Crop: Starch  Management: StandardClimate: tropical. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Populations are scattered in both lowland and montane sites, the latter being in very rough terrain. The plants grow in three types of soils, Jurassic alkaline limestone, more-or-less sandy acidic soils underlaid with slate, and siliceous clays with a pH between 5.4 and 6.9 (slightly acid to slightly alkaline). The habitats vary from grasslands to, more commonly, pine or semi-deciduous forests and conditions range from full sun to deep shade. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: hypothetical. Management: standard (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",Seed,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
