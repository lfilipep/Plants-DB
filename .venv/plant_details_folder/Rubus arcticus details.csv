Very sweet, juicy and palatable with a pineapple-like aroma[1, 101, 172, 183]. Delicious when eaten out of hand, they are also used in making cakes, jams etc[183]. Unfortunately, they are often not produced very prolifically in a garden situation in Britain, probably because they prefer colder winters. Flowers - raw. Sweet and delicious[172].

Rubus arcticus subsp. x stellarcticus G.Larss. is an unresolved nameThis name is unresolved, but some data suggest that it is synonymous with Rubus × stellarcticus (G.Larss.) H.E.Weber , but some data suggest that it is an infraspecific name of Rubus arcticus L..","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
