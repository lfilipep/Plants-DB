Delicious when eaten out of hand, they are also used in making cakes, jams etc[183]. Unfortunately, they are often not produced very prolifically in a garden situation in Britain, probably because they prefer colder winters. Flowers - raw. Sweet and delicious[172]. The fresh or dried leaves are used as a tea substitute[61, 105, 183]."

A very variable species, it is sometimes divided into three species, viz.:- R. arcticus, R. acaulis and R. stellatus[101]. Suitable for growing in containers. Most often in acidic soils rich in organic matter. Rubus arcticus subsp. x stellarcticus G.Larss. is an unresolved nameThis name is unresolved, but some data suggest that it is synonymous with Rubus × stellarcticus (G.Larss.) H.E.Weber , but some data suggest that it is an infraspecific name of Rubus arcticus L.."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
