13,Summary,"Commonly found in East Asia, Oreocnide integrifolia is an evergreen shrub or tree that grows usually about 5 - 20 m in height. It produces one of the strongest fibers in India which are made into ropes, nets, and coarse cloth. It has no known edible and medicinal uses. It can be grown through seeds, cuttings, and root cuttings.",

21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses A brown fibre is obtained from the stems[46 , 387 , 454 ]. Strong, and flexible, it is made into ropes, nets, and coarse cloth[387 ]. This is one of the strongest fibres produced in India[454 ]. The fibre is extracted from shoots less than 12 months old. The outside green skin or bark and a little slimy matter are scraped off, then the ribbons of partly cleaned fibre are stripped from the shoots, the inside of these ribbons is next scraped with a knife so placed in the hand as to allow the edge to rest against the forefinger. The strips are drawn through repeatedly in order to remove the slimy and gummy substances from the inner face. After being cleaned in this way, the ribbons are left to dry in the shade. Wien fully dried they are next steeped in water and wood-ashes for about twenty-four hours, and then boiled in rice water for four hours. The fibre will then be found to be quite free from gum, and may be separated into fine threads[439 ]. An alternative method, which results in a coarser fibre suited to making ropes, nets etc, is to take off the ribbons when the shoots are in a half-dry state without first scraping off the outer bark and gum. The inner face is also left coated with the slimy substance. The fibre is then purified it in a coarse way by washing it in lime and then twisting it into twine, or simply dividing up the ribbons and without any preparation twisting these into twine[439 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An understorey tree of wet evergreen forests, it requires a position in dappled shade[439 ]. Requires a fertile, humus-rich soil[146 ]. The tree grows freely and quickly, and coppices readily[387 ]. It can be coppiced annually to provide a regular supply of stems from which to extract fibre[439 ]. Although this species is in the nettle family (Urticaceae), it does not have stinging hairs on the leaves or stems[266 ]. A dioecious species, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required[266 ].",
