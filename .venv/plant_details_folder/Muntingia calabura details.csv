24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the lowland tropics, where it is found at elevations up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 32°c, but can tolerate 10 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,400 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 1,000 - 2,400mm[418 ]. Probably tolerant of most soil types[K ]. The tree has the reputation of thriving with no care in poor soils and it does well in both acid and alkaline soils and even on old tin tailings[306 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7[303 , 418 ]. Established plants are drought resistant[306 ]. The plant requires a sheltered position, the wide-spread branches tend to break in high winds[418 ]. The tree is often cultivated as an ornamental and shade tree. With its ability to colonise disturbed ground, even on well-trodden land that other trees cannot become established, this tree has spread to many areas of the tropics[303 , 942 ]. It has proved to be invasive in many regions[307 ]. Seedlings flower within two years due to their fast growth[306 , 418 ]. Air-layered plants fruit straight away[306 ]. The plant can establish itself in trodden yards and along shop fronts where no other tree takes root, and it can also withstand the air pollution in city streets[418 ]. Flowering Time: Blooms all year. Bloom Color: White/Near White.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - The seed requires light to germinate[303 ]. Fresh seed germination is enhanced by passage through the digestive tract of bats and birds. The seed is well represented in the seed banks of forest soils and requires high temperature and light conditions for germination[306 ]. The seedlings do not tolerate shade[306 ]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood Air layering. Planters use fresh seeds mixed with the sweet juice of the fruit to sow directly into the field. To prepare seeds for planting, water is added repeatedly to the squeezed-out seeds and juice, and as the seeds sink to the bottom of the container, the water is poured off several times until the seeds are clean enough. They are then dried in the shade.",
