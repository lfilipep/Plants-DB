1,Common Name,"Pillar apple, Crabapple"
2,Family,Rosaceae
3,USDA hardiness,3-8
4,Known Hazards,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."

18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. A gritty texture[1]. A reasonable size, about 2 - 3cm in diameter[200], but the fruit is not freely produced[11, 200]. A tree at Kew is fruiting well, producing fruits about 30mm in diameter and these fruits can hang on the tree all winter[K]. Even when harvested in February the fruits were quite firm, slightly juicy with a strong acid flavour rather like a lemon[K]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Specimen, Street tree. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[1, 200]. This tree is well suited to planting in public-access areas[200]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11]."
