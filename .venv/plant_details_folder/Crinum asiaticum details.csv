See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8.  It is in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,None known,"Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Emetic  PoulticeThe bulb contains alkaloids, notably lycorine and crinamine[283]. A poultice made from the heated, pounded, fresh bulb is used to relieve osteodynia and rheumatism[283]. The juice of the fresh bulb is used as an emetic, whilst it is also instilled in the ear to treat otis[283]. A poultice of the heated, pounded, fresh leaves is used to treat contusions, sprains, fractures, luxations etc[283]. A decoction of the dried leaves is used as a wash in the treatment of haemorrhoids[283].",,None known,,"Prefers a deep, well-drained but moisture-retentive fertile soil that is rich in organic matter[200]. The bulbs must have sufficient moisture during the growing season[200]. Plants are not very cold hardy, tolerating occasional lows down to about -5°c[200]. In regions at the limits of their cold hardiness, they are best given the protection of a south or southwest facing wall. Plant the bulbs shallowly, with the neck of the bulb at soil level, and give a protective mulch of bracken or compost in the winter[200]. A robust and very variable species[270]. Bulbs are sensitive to transplanting and can take several years to become established. After this, they will usually reproduce rapidly from offsets to produce the overcrowded conditions that stimulate them to flower freely[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, placing 2 - 3 seeds in individual pots in a greenhouse. Do not cover the seed. Sow stored seed April/May in a warm greenhouse. Once they have germinated, you can thin each pot to just one plant if required, though we have not found this to be necessary. Give an occasional liquid feed to ensure that the plants do not suffer nutritional deficiencies. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first 2 years, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. Division of offsets in April/May or in September. When divided in the spring, the bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, if done in September, however, they should be potted up and overwintered in the greenhouse.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
