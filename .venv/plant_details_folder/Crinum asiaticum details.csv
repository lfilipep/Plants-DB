22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep, well-drained but moisture-retentive fertile soil that is rich in organic matter[200]. The bulbs must have sufficient moisture during the growing season[200]. Plants are not very cold hardy, tolerating occasional lows down to about -5°c[200]. In regions at the limits of their cold hardiness, they are best given the protection of a south or southwest facing wall. Plant the bulbs shallowly, with the neck of the bulb at soil level, and give a protective mulch of bracken or compost in the winter[200]. A robust and very variable species[270]. Bulbs are sensitive to transplanting and can take several years to become established. After this, they will usually reproduce rapidly from offsets to produce the overcrowded conditions that stimulate them to flower freely[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe, placing 2 - 3 seeds in individual pots in a greenhouse. Do not cover the seed. Sow stored seed April/May in a warm greenhouse. Once they have germinated, you can thin each pot to just one plant if required, though we have not found this to be necessary. Give an occasional liquid feed to ensure that the plants do not suffer nutritional deficiencies. Grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first 2 years, planting them out into their permanent positions in the spring. Division of offsets in April/May or in September. When divided in the spring, the bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, if done in September, however, they should be potted up and overwintered in the greenhouse.",
