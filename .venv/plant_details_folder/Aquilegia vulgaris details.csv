Thrives in partial shade[1, 111]. Intolerant of heavy clay[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -25°c[187]. Whilst the blue-flowered forms of this species have no scent, white flowered forms have a soft clove scent in order to attract pollinating insects[245]. Most species are short-lived, dying out after 2 - 3 years, though they usually produce seed prolifically[200]. This species usually self-sows freely in the garden, it is very apt to hybridize with other members of the genus and usually becomes the dominant partner in any hybridization[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54, 201]. It also attracts red spider mites to the garden, these can then move on to other crops such as apples, pears and strawberries[201]. It grows well with rhubarb[201].  Special Features:Attracts birds, Not North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Suitable for cut flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. The seed can be slow to germinate[200]. Stored seed can be sown in late winter in a cold frame. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Division in spring[200]."
