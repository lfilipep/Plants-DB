13,Summary,"A nitrogen fixing perennial herb.  As a carbon farming plant it can be used for nitrogen, as an understory legume and for fodder (bank, pasture)."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Desmodium paniculatum is an evergreen Perennial growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Contour hedgerow: Alley cropping systems on the contour of slopes.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None Known
22,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
23,Other Uses Description,"Carbon Farming Solutions - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, understory legume. : bank, pasture (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland). Attracts bees and attracts birds."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Wild Crop: Some wild plants have strong historical or contemporary use. Although they are not cultivated crops, they may be wild-managed."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Bank  Fodder: Pasture  Management: Fodder  Wild CropClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: semi-arid to humid. Prefers partial sun, mesic to dry-mesic conditions, and sandy or rocky soil. Light preferences: part-sun, part-shade. Low to medium water usage with a dry to moist soil. Soil type: acid and neutral and an average to poor loam, clay, or sand. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: wild. Management: fodder (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed germinates quickly (3-4 days) without scarification.
