0,Hemerocallis middendorffii esculenta,,Hemerocallidaceae,4-8,"Large quantities of the leaves are said to be hallucinogenic. Blanching the leaves removes this hallucinatory component[205]. (This report does not make clear what it means by blanching, it could be excluding light from the growing shoots or immersing in boiling water[K].)","Meadows in high mountains, N. and C.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",H. esculenta.

They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[105, 127, 177, 183]. The flowers are crisp and succulent with a delicious sweet flavour and no aftertaste[K]. The flowers can be dried and used as a thickener in soups etc. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205].","Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Vitamin CThe juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205].,"Weaving: Items such as grass and palm leaves that are woven together for making mats, baskets etc. See also Basket making and Fibre.","The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205]. Plants form a spreading clump and are suitable for ground cover when spaced about 45cm apart each way[208]. The dead leaves should be left on the ground in the winter to ensure effective cover[208]. (This report was for a plant labelled H. middendorfiana, which I have assumed is a mis-spelling of this species[K])",,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil and a sunny position[111] but tolerating partial shade[88]. Plants flower less freely in a shady position though the flowers can last longer in such a position[205]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Individual flowers only live for one day[205]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved but then form large clumps[200, 187]. The roots are fibrous without any obvious swellings[205]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200].","Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
