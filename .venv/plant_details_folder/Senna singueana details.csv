21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Anthelmintic  Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antipyretic  Antispasmodic  Antitussive  Antiviral  Astringent  Epilepsy  Galactogogue  Laxative  Leprosy  Malaria  Ophthalmic  Purgative  Skin  StomachicThe plant has many medicinal uses throughout Africa[299 ]. Modern research has shown the presence of a range of medically active compounds. The roots contain 4 tetrahydroanthracene derivatives, singueanol-I and -II, torosachrysone and germichrysone, as well as the pentacyclic triterpene lupeol and steroids (campesterol, ß-sitosterol and stigmasterol). The anthracene derivatives have shown significant activity against several gram-positive bacteria in vitro and also antispasmodic activity[299 ]. Extracts of the root bark have shown significant analgesic, antipyretic, anthelmintic and antiplasmodial activity[299 ]. The leaves have been shown to have anthelmintic and antiviral properties, but no significant antibacterial activity[299 ]. The stem bark and leaves contain tannins and are astringent[299 ]. The leaves, stem and the root bark are all used as anthelmintics and to treat bilharzia[299 ]. An infusion of the leaves is used as a remedy for venereal disease, malaria, convulsions, epilepsy, coughs, intestinal worms, constipation, heartburn and stomach-ache[398 ]. A hot water infusion of the leaves is drunk and the warm leaves are applied as a compress to treat fever. The leaves, either as a decoction or infusion, or as a dried powder, are applied to wounds caused by leprosy and syphilis[299 ]. An infusion of the leaves is applied as eye drops to cure conjunctivitis[299 ]. A decoction of the roots is used to treat wounds and as a remedy for diarrhoea, convulsions, dementia and STDs[398 ]. The roots are used to treat venereal diseases, stomach complaints and as a purgative. The roots are also used to cure impotence caused by diabetes. The ash of burnt roots is eaten mixed with porridge to cure abdominal pain[299 ]. Extracts of the stem bark are taken to cure stomach complaints. Like the leaves, the stem bark is used to treat skin disorders and malaria[299 ]. An infusion of the flowers is used as an eye lotion[299 ]. The fruit pulp soaked in water and cooked with a staple food is eaten by lactating women as it is considered a galactagogue[299 ]."
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Fruit ripening: Substances that promote the premature or rapid ripening of fruits.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used for soil improvement[398 ]. A nitrogen fixer. A suitable candidate for agroforestry in dry areas[398 ]. Other Uses: The stem bark is used as a dye for textile in Ethiopia and Zambia and for tanning hides in large parts of East Africa[299 ]. The fruits are used in Sudan for tanning skins[299 ]. The leaves contain the flavonoid leucopelargonidin, which has dyeing properties[299 ]. Bananas are wrapped in the leaves to speed ripening[299 ]. The root fibres are used in hairpieces[299 ]. The wood is pale brown in colour with a distinct grain[299 , 303 ]. It is used for hut building, small furniture, tool handles, spoons and carvings[299 , 364 , 398 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[299 , 364 , 398 ]. : Pod."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Fodder: Pod  Management: Standard  Regional CropA plant of low to moderate elevations in the drier tropics, where it can be found from sea level to over 2,000 metres. It is found mainly in areas where the mean annual temperature is from 25 - 30°c, and the mean annual rainfall is within the range 500 - 1,000mm[299 , 303 ]. A fast-growing plant[299 ]. The plant responds well to coppicing[299 , 303 ]. The plant is fairly susceptible to fire, though its thick bark does give it some protection[299 ]. Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[755 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - pre-soak in warm water for 12 hours prior to sowing. The seed usually sprouts within 9 days of sowing, with around 78% germinating[299 ]."
