13,Summary,Filbert is similar to the common Hazel with a nut more fully enclosed by the husk. It too is ideal for coppicing. The nuts are ready to harvest in autumn when the husks have yellowed.Filbert is a Carbon Farming Solution plant with similar properties to hazelnut.
14,Physical Characteristics,"Corylus heterophylla is a deciduous Tree growing to 7 m (23ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Oil: Oil,Oil: "
19,Edible Uses Description,"d - raw or cooked[46, 61, 105, 177]. The seed, which has a hard shell, is of relatively good flavour[183]. Rich in oil. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Digestive: Aids digestion."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  DigestiveThe seed is digestive and appetizer[218].
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses."
23,Other Uses Description,None known
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Other Systems: Strip intercrop  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilAn easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, but is in general more productive of seeds when grown on soils of moderate fertility[11, 200]. It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. This species is cultivated in Asia for its edible seed[61] but it is of little value as a nut bearer in Britain[1]. Closely related to C. avellana[1]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200]. Division of suckers in early spring. Very easy, they can be planted out straight into their permanent positions."
