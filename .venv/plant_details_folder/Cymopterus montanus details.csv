24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,We have almost no information on the needs of this species and do not know if it is hardy in Britain. We suggest growing it in a sunny position in a well-drained light or medium soil[K].
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a greenhouse. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn might be possible."
