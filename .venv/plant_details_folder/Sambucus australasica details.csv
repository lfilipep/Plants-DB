0,Sambucus australasica,Yellow Elderberry,Caprifoliaceae,9-10,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the leaves and stems of some members of this genus are poisonous[9, 76]. The fruit of many species (although no records have been seen for this species) has been known to cause stomach upsets to some people. Any toxin the fruit might contain is liable to be of very low toxicity and is destroyed when the fruit is cooked[65, 76].","Light rainforest and wet eucalyptus forests, up to the montane zone.","Australia - New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria.",(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SambucusAustralasica.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Sambucus australasica is a deciduous Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft 8in). The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. A sweetish taste[154, 193]. The fruit is juicy with a mild pleasant flavour[144]. Some forms are bitter[193]. The fruit is quite small but is borne in large clusters and is easy to harvest. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Flowers - raw or cooked.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"Wood - pale, soft, light[154].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it is only likely to be hardy outdoors in the mildest areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Tolerates most soils, including chalk[200], but prefers a moist loamy soil[1, 200]. Tolerates some shade but is best in a sunny position[1]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution and coastal situations[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame, when it should germinate in early spring. Stored seed can be sown in the spring in a cold frame but will probably germinate better if it is given 2 months warm followed by 2 months cold stratification first[78, 98, 113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If good growth is made, the young plants can be placed in their permanent positions during the early summer. Otherwise, either put them in a sheltered nursery bed, or keep them in their pots in a sheltered position and plant them out in spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth 15 - 20cm with a heel, late autumn in a frame or a sheltered outdoor bed[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
