0,Malus coronaria,"Garland Crab, Sweet crab apple",Rosaceae,4-8,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Bottoms, wooded slopes, thickets and clearings[43] in most soil types and moisture levels[159].","Eastern N. America - New York to South Carolina, west to Kansas.",(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MalusCoronaria.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MalusCoronaria2.jpg",,"Malus coronaria is a deciduous Tree growing to 7 m (23ft) by 7 m (23ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Bog Garden;,Fruit: ,Pectin: a substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,"Fruit - raw or cooked[159, 161]. Fairly large, it is up to 5cm in diameter[200]. Harsh and acid[11], it is mainly used for jellies[183] but can be eaten raw when it is fully ripe[101]. The fruits can be buried in the ground overwinter and will have lost much of their acidity by the spring[183]. The fruit can also be dried and stored for later use[257]. Rich in pectin, so it can be added to pectin-low fruits when making jams or jellies[226]. Pectin is also said to protect the body against radiation[201].","Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A cold infusion of the bark has been used as a wash for black eyes, sore eyes and snow blindness[257]. A decoction of the root has been used to treat suppressed menses and so can cause an abortion, especially early in the pregnancy[257].","Pectin: A substance that is used to thicken jams etc and as a culture medium in laboratories.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The plant can be used as a rootstock for cultivated apples, conferring a greater hardiness[226].  - heavy, close-grained, not strong[46, 82, 229]. It weighs 43lb per cubic foot[235]. Used for making levers, the handles of tools, small domestic items and fuel[46, 82, 229].",,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade, though it fruits less well in such a situation[200]. A slow-growing and short-lived tree in the wild[229]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. This species is closely related to M. ionensis[1]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of mature wood, November in a frame[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
