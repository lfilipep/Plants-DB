When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
