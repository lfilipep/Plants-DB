24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fairly good loamy soil in a sunny sheltered position[11, 164, 200. Succeeds in light shade[200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c and succeeds outdoors from Sussex and westwards[200]. There is some confusion over the name of this species, some botanists unite this species with the S. American C. ruscifolia whilst others maintain that they are distinct[11, 200]. The roots of plants in this genus bear nitrogen-fixing nodules[218]. Whilst much of the nitrogen will be utilized by the growing plant, some of it will become available for other plants growing nearby[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow February/March in a greenhouse[78]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Fair percentage[78].",
