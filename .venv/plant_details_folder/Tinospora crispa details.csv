Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antirheumatic  Cancer  Carminative  Cholera  Febrifuge  Hypotensive  Malaria  Parasiticide  Skin  Tonic  Vermifuge  VulneraryConsidered to be a universal medicine by local people in the Philippines who give it the name 'makabuhai', which means 'to give life'[582 ]. The plant is commonly prescribed as a decoction or in powder form in the treatment of fevers, stomach trouble, indigestion, and diarrhoea. It is the basis of a popular preparation, which is used as a cordial, a tonic, or an ingredient in cocktails[582 ]. A preparation made with coconut oil is an effective cure for rheumatism and is also used in the treatment of flatulence in children[582 ]. This preparation is made by chopping the stem into pieces 2 - 5cm long and placing them in a jar with coconut oil,. This jar is then left out in a sunny position to 'cook' and is then stored for 12 months until it is ready to use[582 ]. The stem is antimalarial, parasiticide, tonic and vulnerary[582 ]. It is taken internally in the treatment of fevers[582 ]. Taken externally, a decoction of the stem is considered an effective cure if used as a wash for tropical ulcers, external parasites, and is also an excellent vulnerary for itches, ordinary and cancerous wounds[582 ]. An infusion of the stem is drunk in Malaysia and Indonesia as a vermifuge and of the whole plant to treat cholera; it is also used to treat diabetes mellitus[310 ]. Externally it is applied against scabies and to heal wounds. In Brunei, the plant is used in the treatment of high blood pressure, diabetes and to relieve abdominal pains. In Indo-China, an infusion of the stem is drunk to treat fever (also when caused by malaria) and jaundice. Powdered stems are used to fatten horses and cattle by stimulating their appetite.
