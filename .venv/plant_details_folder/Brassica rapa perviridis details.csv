24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a moisture-retentive well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200, 206]. Prefers a cool moist reasonably fertile soil[52]. The plant is somewhat deeper rooted than many of the oriental brassicas and is more tolerant of drought, though it grows best if it is not short of water[206]. Mustard spinach is widely cultivated in the Orient for its edible leaves, there are many named varieties[206]. It takes 55 - 80 days for plants to reach maturity from sowing[206]. This is a very hardy plant, although knocked back, it has withstood temperatures down to about -14°c and can be cropped for most of the year[206]. It is much less likely to bolt from a spring sowing and is fairly resistant to summer heat[206].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ April to September[206]. Some varieties can also be sown in a cold greenhouse in late autumn, winter or early spring to provide leaves overwinter and in late spring.",
