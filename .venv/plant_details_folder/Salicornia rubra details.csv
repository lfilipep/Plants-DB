This species is little, if at all, cultivated and its exact requirements are not clearly understood[264]. It is not known if the plant will require periodic inundation by salty water to grow well[264]. We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. This species might be no more than a synonym for S. europaea[235], some botanists seeing it as being part of that aggregate species[264]. This species is closely related to S. prostrata[270]. The plants native habitat will give some idea of its cultivation needs.","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in situ as soon as it is ripe if this is possible, otherwise sow in spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
