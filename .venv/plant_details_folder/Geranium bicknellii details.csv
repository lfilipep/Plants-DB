24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any moderately fertile retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates a range of soil types[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or autumn in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer."
