0,Citrus latifolia,Citrus Tahitian Lime,Rutaceae,9-11,Excessive exposure to the essential oil in the peel of the fruit may cause dermatitis [336 ]. Rolling the fruit between the hands before squeezing to extract more of the juice will coat the hands with oil and transfer this to whatever parts of the body are touched before washing the hands [336 ]. Subsequent exposure to sunlight often results in brown or red areas that itch intensely and sometimes severe blistering [336 ]. The tree sap and scratches by the thorns may cause a rash in sensitive individuals [336 ].,Not known in the wild,A species of garden origin.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Tender,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Citrus_latifolia1.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Citrus_latifolia2.JPEG",,"Citrus latifolia is an evergreen Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.","C. x latifolia. C. x aurantiifolia var. latifolia Yu.Tanaka.

The seedless, juicy, thin-skinned fruit has a great flavour and an endless range of uses in the kitchen. The flesh is a translucent pale green, tender and juicy with an authentic acid lime flavour. The fruit is about 6 cm (2.4 in) in diameter, often with slightly nippled ends, and is usually sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. The fruits are used for making drinks [317 ]. The pulp is succulent, firm, very acidic and sugarless [317 ]. The juice is a substitute for vinegar [317 ]. It is also widely available dried, as it is often used this way in Persian cuisine. It is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than Key Lime (Citrus aurantifolia). The advantages of the Tahitian Lime in commercial agriculture compared to the Key Lime are the larger size, absence of seeds, hardiness, lack of thorns on the bushes, and longer fruit shelf life. They are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness of their unique flavour.","Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Aromatherapy: Plants whose essential oils are used in Aromatherapy.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Antiinflammatory  Aromatherapy  Skin  Vitamin CThe juice of the fruit is utilized medicinally [317 ]. Lime juice, given quickly, is an effective antidote for the painful oral irritation and inflammation that result from biting into aroids such as Dieffenbachia spp., Xanthosoma spp., Philodendron spp., and their allies [336 ]. Lime juice is also applied to relieve the effects of stinging corals [336 ]. Citrus species contain a wide range of active ingredients, and research is still underway in finding uses for them. They are rich in vitamin C, flavonoids, acids and volatile oils. They also contain coumarins such as bergapten which sensitizes the skin to sunlight. Bergapten is sometimes added to tanning preparations since it promotes pigmentation in the skin, though it can cause dermatitis or allergic responses in some people [238 ]. Some of the plants more recent applications are as sources of anti-oxidants and chemical exfoliants in specialized cosmetics [238 ].","Cleanser: For various materials.

A citrus fruit species of hybrid origin; a triploid cross between Key Lime (Citrus _ aurantiifolia) and Lemon (Citrus limon). Three main climates are suitable for commercial citrus production - tropical climates, subtropical with winter rain in the Mediterranean and semitropical with summer rainfall as found in Florida and southern Brazil [200 ]. The optimal temperatures for citrus cultivation range between 25 - 30°c, with the coldest month having an average minimum of at least 15°c [200 ]. Growth generally ceases below 13°c and above 38°c [200 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 1,500mm, but tolerates 750 - 2,300mm [418 ]. If there are dry periods of more than three months, then irrigation will be necessary [200 ]. Limes prefer deep, well-drained but moisture-retentive loamy soil in full sun [200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 5 - 7.5 [200 , 418 ]. The plant flowers and fruits all year round but with a distinct fruiting peak towards the end of summer [336 ]. Yields of 41 kilos of fruit have been obtained from trees two metres tall [336 ]. Tahiti lime flowers have no viable pollen [336 ]. When grown on their own, they produce a usually seedless fruit; rarely, the fruit may contain one or a few seeds, especially if planted among several other Citrus species [336 ]. The tree is nearly thornless. Cultivars include Bearss lime, Page lime, Persian lime, Pond's lime, and Tahiti lime. Tolerate light frost. Trees are self-pollinated and suit backyards and orchards. They can be pruned to 2 metres high for use as a large container plant. A wide range of tree sizes is available depending on the rootstock, including dwarf varieties. The time to Fruit/Flower/Harvest is typically 4-5 Years. Pick the fruit green as it can suffer from rot if left to ripen on the tree. Espalier.",Seed.
