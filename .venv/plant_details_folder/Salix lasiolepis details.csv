13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix lasiolepis is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft 4in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Uses Description,None known,
18,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antipruritic: Treats itching of the skin.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.",
19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antipruritic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  FebrifugeThe bark is antipruritic, astringent, diaphoretic and febrifuge[257]. An infusion of the bark has been used in the treatment of colds, chills, fevers, measles and various diseases where sweating can be beneficial[257]. A decoction of the bark has been used as a wash for itchy skin[257]. An infusion of the leaves has been used in the treatment of colds and diarrhoea[257]. A decoction of the catkins has been used in the treatment of colds[257]. The fresh bark contains salicin, which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[213].",
20,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.",
21,Other Uses Description,"The stems have been used in basket making[229, 257]. The stems have been split for making coiled baskets or as for the weft in twined baskets, whilst they are used unsplit as the warp in twined baskets[257]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The tough inner bark, harvested in the spring, has been used to make rope and clothing[257]. The wood is close-grained, light, soft and weak, but has been used for fuel and to make charcoal[82, 229]. Dynamic accumulator.",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A fast-growing but short-lived species[229], it is shrub-like and from 1 - 6 metres tall in the north of its range, becoming more tree-like in California[60]. This species is closely related to S. irrorata[11]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. They form a valuable early food for bumble bees[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
