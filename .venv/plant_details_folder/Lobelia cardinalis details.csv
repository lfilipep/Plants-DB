22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Requires a deep rich soil and plenty of moisture[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in standing water though is not then so long lived[200]. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[200]. Requires protection from the wind[200]. Dormant plants are hardy to at least -25°c[187], though they can be excited into premature growth in mild winter areas and are then more susceptible to frost damage[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus.  Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 8 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring[200]. Basal cuttings in spring[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Layering in moist sand, it forms roots at the nodes[200].",
