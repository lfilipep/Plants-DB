24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Standard, Seashore, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils, including chalk, but dislikes acid soils[11]. Prefers a deep stiff well-drained loam in a warm sunny position[11, 200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it does tend to sucker quite freely though[200]. There are many named varieties, developed for their ornamental value[182]. The flowers attract butterflies and moths[30]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow March in a north facing cold frame. Pre-treating the seed with 4 weeks warm then 3 weeks cold stratification improves germination. It is probable that sowing the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame would be a more reliable method[K]. Prick the seedlings out into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. Plant them out in the summer if sufficient growth has been made, otherwise grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of young shoots, 7cm with a heel, June in a frame[200]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[200]. Layering in spring before new growth begins. Takes 12 months[78]. Division of suckers in late winter. They can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",
