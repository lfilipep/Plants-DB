4,Known Hazards,"The essential oil in the seed and flowering plant is highly toxic. In excess it can cause dizziness, vomiting, convulsions and even death[222, 238]. The plant can also cause dermatitis or other allergic reactions[222]. The leaves and seeds of all members of this genus are more or less edible. However, many of the species in this genus contain saponins, though usually in quantities too small to do any harm. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]. The plants also contain some oxalic acid, which in large quantities can lock up some of the nutrients in the food. However, even considering this, they are very nutritious vegetables in reasonable quantities. Cooking the plant will reduce its content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Chenopodium ambrosioides anthelminticum is a ANNUAL/PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 0.7 m (2ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to October, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."
15,Synonyms,C. anthelminticum.
16,Plant Habitats,Cultivated Beds;
17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - cooked[2]. The tender leaves are sometimes used as a potherb[183]. Used as a condiment in soups etc[46, 61, 105], it is said to reduce flatulence if eaten with beans[183]. The leaves have a rank taste due to the presence of resinous dots and sticky hairs[85]. The raw leaves should only be eaten in small quantities, see the notes above on toxicity. Seed - cooked[105, 161]. The seed is small and fiddly, it should be soaked in water overnight and thoroughly rinsed before it is used in order to remove any saponins. An infusion of the leaves is a tea substitute[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antiasthmatic: Treats asthma.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiasthmatic  Antifungal  Carminative  Dysentery  Stomachic  VermifugeWormseed is a Central American herb that has been used for centuries to expel parasitic worms from the body[254]. The whole plant is analgesic, antiasthmatic, carminative, stomachic and vermifuge[1, 4, 21, 57, 145, 147, 171]. An infusion can be used as a digestive remedy, being taken to settle a wide range of problems such colic and stomach pains[254]. Externally, it has been used as a wash for haemorrhoids, as a poultice to detoxify snake bites and other poisons and is thought to have wound-healing properties[254]. Use with caution and preferably under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[21, 238]. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Until fairly recently, this was one of the most commonly used vermifuges, though it has now been largely replaced by synthetic drugs[222]. The seed, or an essential oil expressed from the seed, was used[213]. It is very effective against most parasites, including the amoeba that causes dysentery, but is less effective against tapeworm[213, 238]. Fasting should not precede its use and there have occasionally been cases of poisoning caused by this treatment[213]. The oil is used externally to treat athlete's foot and insect bites[238]. One report says that it is an essential oil that is utilised[240]. This is obtained from the seed or the flowering stems, it is at its highest concentration in the flowering stems before seed is set, these contain around 0.7% essential oil of which almost 50% is the active vermifuge ascaridol[240]. The essential oil is of similar quality from plants cultivated in warm climates and those in cool climates[240]. The leaves are added in small quantities as a flavouring for various cooked bean dishes because their carminative activity can reduce flatulence[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Insecticide: Kills insects."
23,Other Uses Description,The plant is used as a fumigant against mosquitoes and is also added to fertilizers to inhibit insect larvae[238]. Gold/green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils but disliking shade[1, 200]. It prefers a moderately fertile soil[200]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 8.3. Plants are annuals or short-lived perennials[238]. They are not very hardy when grown outdoors in Britain and so are best grown as an annual[238]. Plants have often self-sown freely in our Cornish trial grounds, but the seed germinates in the autumn and does not manage to survive the winter[238]. Wormseed is sometimes grown as a medicinal and culinary plant, especially in its native Mexico. This sub-species is more active medicinally than the type species and is the form most often cultivated for its vermicidal activity[4, 46, 50, 238]. It is one of the safest and best vermifuges available[4]. The bruised leaves emit an unpleasant foetid odour[245]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - whilst it can be sown in situ in mid to late spring, we have had better results by sowing the seed in a cold frame in early spring. Put a few seeds in each pot and thin to the best plant if necessary. Germination rates are usually very good and the seedlings should appear within a few days of sowing the seed. Plant out in late spring, after the last expected frosts."
