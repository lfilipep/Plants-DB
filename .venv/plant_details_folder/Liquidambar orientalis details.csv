0,Liquidambar orientalis,Oriental Sweet Gum,Hamamelidaceae,7-10,None known,"Flood plains, marshy places and valley sides near streams to elevations of 1800 metres in Turkey[93].",W. Asia.,(2 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LiquidambarOrientalis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Liquidambar orientalis is a deciduous Tree growing to 10 m (32ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",L. imberbe.,Woodland Garden Secondary;,,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,A chewing gum and a stabilizer for cakes etc are obtained from the resin[177]. This resin is also used to flavour baked foods etc[183].,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidote  Antiinflammatory  Parasiticide  Pectoral  Salve  Stimulant  VulneraryA resin obtained from the wood and inner bark acts both as an irritant and an expectorant within the respiratory tract. It is one of the ingredients of 'Friar's Balsam', an expectorant mixture that is inhaled to stimulate a productive cough[254]. Externally it is applied to the skin to treat a range of diseases[254]. The resin is also mixed with Hamamelis virginiana and Rose water to make an astringent face lotion[254]. The resin is antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, expectorant, pectoral, salve and stimulant[46, 57, 61, 176, 218, 238]. It is taken internally in the treatment of strokes, infantile convulsions, coma, heart disease and pruritis[238]. It is also used in the treatment of cancer[218]. Externally it is mixed with oil and used to treat scabies, wounds, ulcers etc[238, 254]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and the resin extracted from the bark[254]. The leaves, fruits and roots are used in similar ways to the resin[238] and are also considered to be antidote, parasiticide and vulnerary[218].","Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The aromatic resin 'Storax' is obtained from the trunk of this tree[57, 64]. It forms in cavities of the bark and also exudes naturally. It is harvested in autumn. Production can be stimulated by beating the trunk in the spring[171, 238]. The resin has a wide range of uses including medicinal, incense, perfumery, soaps etc. It is also used as a parasiticide[46, 61]. Liquid storax gives greater permanence to the odours of flowers extracted by maceration[245]. It is also used in the imitation of other scents as an alternative to vanilla, ambergris and benzoin, or to complement them[245]. The aromatic bark is burnt as an incense[245].",,"Prefers a moist but not swampy loam in a sheltered position[1, 200]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil[130]. Grows poorly on shallow soils overlying chalk[188]. Plants can be grown in full sun so long as the soil is not dry hungry and shallow[130]. Young plants are susceptible to damage from late frosts[11, 130, 200]. Mature plants are fully hardy but prefer a hotter climate if they are to do well[11]. Plants rarely, if ever, flower in Britain[11]. They rarely flower in climatic zones colder than zone 7[200]. An aromatic gum exudes from the trunk. The fragrance is also present to some extent in the leaves, especially if they are bruised[245]. This species resents root disturbance, young plants should be pot-grown and be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. A slow growing plant[1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Harvest the seed capsules at the end of October or November, dry in a warm place and extract the seed by shaking the capsule. Stored seed requires 1 - 3 months stratification and sometimes takes 2 years to germinate. Sow it as early in the year as possible. Germination rates are often poor. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first winter. Since they resent root disturbance, it is best to plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their second year and give them some protection from cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Suckers in early spring. Layering in October/November. Takes 12 months.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
