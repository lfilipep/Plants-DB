22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a very well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c if it is given perfect drainage[200]. Plants dislike root disturbance[200] and should be put into their final positions as soon as possible. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest pre-soaking the seed for 12 - 24 hours (by which time it should have swollen up) in warm water and sowing it in a greenhouse in early spring. Pot up the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in late spring or early summer in their permanent positions. Cuttings of half ripe wood, July/August in a frame. It is probably best to put each cutting in its own pot."
