Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest pre-soaking the seed for 12 - 24 hours (by which time it should have swollen up) in warm water and sowing it in a greenhouse in early spring. Pot up the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in late spring or early summer in their permanent positions.
