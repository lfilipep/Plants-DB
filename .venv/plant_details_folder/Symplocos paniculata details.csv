One report says that plants are hardy to about -10°c, though it is also said that they can survive quite harsh winters outdoors in Britain but that they need a warm, sunny protected position and a hot summer if they are to fruit well[11, 200]. The fruits are sometimes spoiled by frosts[200]. The flowers are sweetly fragrant[200, 245]. Self-sterile, it needs cross-pollination with a different plant in the same species if seed and fruit are to be produced[11, 182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed requires stratification and is best sown in a cold frame in late winter, it can take 12 months to germinate[11]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a cold frame[78, 200]. Roots are formed in about 4 weeks.
