18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - cooked[177]. Used in jams, jellies and sauce[183]. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Ophthalmic  TonicThe bark is astringent, cooling and tonic[240]. It is useful in the treatment of menorrhagia, bowel complaints, eye diseases and ulcers[240]. It is also used as a gargle for giving firmness to spongy and bleeding gums[240]. The juice of the bark is applied externally to sprains and muscular swellings[272]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Mordant: Used for making a dye more permanent, it also affects the colour of the dye.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow or red dye is obtained from the leaves and bark[51, 146, 158, 272]. We have no specific information for this species but many species in this genus contain alum and can be used as mordants when dyeing[168].  - white, soft to moderately hard. close grained, liable to twist and split when seasoning. Of possible use in turnery[146, 158]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires an acid soil and a sunny position. Succeeds in a sunny position in any well-drained fertile neutral to acid soil[182, 200]. One report says that plants are hardy to about -10°c, though it is also said that they can survive quite harsh winters outdoors in Britain but that they need a warm, sunny protected position and a hot summer if they are to fruit well[11, 200]. The fruits are sometimes spoiled by frosts[200]. The flowers are sweetly fragrant[200, 245]. Self-sterile, it needs cross-pollination with a different plant in the same species if seed and fruit are to be produced[11, 182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed requires stratification and is best sown in a cold frame in late winter, it can take 12 months to germinate[11]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a cold frame[78, 200]. Roots are formed in about 4 weeks. Good percentage[78]."
