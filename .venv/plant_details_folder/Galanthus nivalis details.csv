23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Alpine garden, Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Woodland garden. Prefers a moist heavy loam[108], growing well in grass or amongst shrubs[1]. Prefers a shady position[28, 31]. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -5°c[214]. A very ornamental plant[1], it grows well on the woodland edge[24]. The bulbs should be planted about 5 - 7cm deep as early in the spring as possible[1]. A good bee plant, providing an early source of pollen and nectar[108].  Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Fragrant flowers.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1]. Sow the seed thinly so that there is no need to thin them. The seed usually germinates in the spring[1]. Grow them on in the same pot in a cold frame for the first two years, giving an occasional liquid feed to ensure the plants do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs whilst they are still in leaf in early summer of their second year's growth, putting about 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on in the cold frame for a further year before planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring whilst they are still in growth. The plants take about 4 years to flower from seed[200]. Division of offsets[1, 200]. This is best done immediately after the plants have finished flowering (and still have green leaves) though it can also be done in late summer and early autumn when the plants are dormant[200].
