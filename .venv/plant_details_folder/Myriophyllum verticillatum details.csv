25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sandy medium, rich in decaying organic matter, in full sun[200]. Hardy to about -15°c[200], the plants overwinter as resting buds at the bottom of the pond[1, 56]. A good water oxygenator[200], it is also ideal in providing a repository for fish spawn[188].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but the seed is quite probably of limited germination, especially if it becomes dry, and so is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame if this is possible. Otherwise store the seed in a cool place in a jar of water and sow in the spring. Keep the pots in trays of water. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the spring. Cuttings can be inserted directly into the soil of the pond at any time in the growing season[56]. Division.",
