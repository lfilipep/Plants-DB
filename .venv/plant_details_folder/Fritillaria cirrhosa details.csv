24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained loamy soil[42]. Prefers peat bed conditions, the plant should not be allowed to dry out[134]. In cultivation at Kew[42] and thriving in a sunny stony bed at Keillour Castle in Perthshire[90], this species does not, however, do well in all gardens[1]. It is much valued as a herbal remedy in China[163]. This species is closely related to F. meleagris[42].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as ripe in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[1]. Protect from frost[134]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible and can take a year or more to germinate[134]. Sow the seed quite thinly to avoid the need to prick out the seedlings. Once they have germinated, give them an occasional liquid feed to ensure that they do not suffer mineral deficiency. Once they die down at the end of their second growing season, divide up the small bulbs, planting 2 - 3 to an 8cm deep pot. Grow them on for at least another year in light shade in the greenhouse before planting them out whilst dormant. Division of offsets in August[1]. The larger bulbs can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up the smaller bulbs and grow them on in a cold frame for a year before planting them out in the autumn. Bulb scales[163].",
