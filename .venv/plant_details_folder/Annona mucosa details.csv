Plants are becoming threatened in the wild due to deforestation[ 307 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed of many species in this genus has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ]. Sow the seed in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A germination rate in excess of 50% can be expected from treated seeds[ 420 ]. When the seedlings are 6 - 8cm tall, pot them up into individual containers[ 420 ]. Layering. Grafting."
