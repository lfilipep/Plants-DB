24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun or light shade[200]. Cultivated for its edible fruit in the Ukraine[50]. There are some named varieties[183, 200]. 'Purple de Milpa' has small purple-tinged fruits with a sharp flavour, they keep well[200]. Closely related to P. ixocarpa, this is probably the wild species that P. ixocarpa was derived from in cultivation[170]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow March/April in a greenhouse only just covering the seed. Germination usually takes place quickly and freely. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of fairly rich soil when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection such as a cloche until they are growing away well. Diurnal temperature fluctuations assist germination[170].
