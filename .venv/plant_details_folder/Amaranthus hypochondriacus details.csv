0,Amaranthus hypochondriacus,"Prince's Feather, Prince-of-wales feather",Amaranthaceae,3-10,"No members of this genus are known to be poisonous, but when grown on nitrogen-rich soils they are known to concentrate nitrates in the leaves. This is especially noticeable on land where chemical fertilizers are used. Nitrates are implicated in stomach cancers, blue babies and some other health problems. It is inadvisable, therefore, to eat this plant if it is grown inorganically.",A weed of wasteland and agricultural land.,Southern N. America.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusHypochondriacus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusHypochondriacus2.jpg",,"Amaranthus hypochondriacus is a ANNUAL/PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is frost tender. It is in leaf from April to October, in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. hybridus hypochondriachus. (L.)Thell.,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",Colouring: edible dyes,"Young leaves - cooked as a spinach[183, 238]. Rich in vitamins and minerals, they have a mild flavour[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. They can be used as a cereal substitute. They can also be popped in much the same way as popcorn[183]. The seed can be soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then allowed to sprout for about 11 days[244]. They can then be added to salads[183]. Very small but the seed is easy to harvest and very nutritious. The seed can be cooked whole, and becomes very gelatinous like this, but it is rather difficult to crush all of the small seeds in the mouth and thus some of the seed will pass right through the digestive system without being assimilated[K]. A red pigment obtained from the plant is used as a food colouring[238].","Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  AstringentThe whole plant contains tannin and is astringent[238, 254]. It is used internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and excessive menstruation[238, 254]. It can be used as a gargle to soothe inflammation of the pharynx and to hasten the healing of ulcerated mouths[254], whilst it can also be applied externally to treat vaginal discharges, nosebleeds and wounds[238]. The plant can be used fresh or it can also be harvested when coming into flower and dried for later use[238].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Yellow and green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168]. A red dye obtained from the plant (the report does not specify which part of the plant) is used as a colouring in foods and medicines[238].,,"Prefers a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Requires a hot sheltered position if it is to do well[K]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5.2 to 7.5. Plants should not be given inorganic fertilizers, see notes above on toxicity. Often cultivated, especially in tropical areas, for its edible leaves and seeds, there are many named varieties[183]. This is the most robust and highest yielding of the grain amaranths, though it is late maturing and therefore less suitable for northern areas[183]. Most if not all members of this genus photosynthesize by a more efficient method than most plants. Called the 'C4 carbon-fixation pathway', this process is particularly efficient at high temperatures, in bright sunlight and under dry conditions[196]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].",Seed - sow late spring in situ. An earlier sowing can be made in a greenhouse and the plants put out after the last expected frosts. Germination is usually rapid and good if the soil is warm[133]. A drop in temperature overnight aids germination[133]. Cuttings of growing plants root easily[206].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
