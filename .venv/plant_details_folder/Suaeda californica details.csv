It dislikes shade, see the plants native range for other ideas on its cultivation needs.","Seed - we have no information on this species but it would probably succeed from an outdoor sowing in mid spring in situ. Only just cover the seed. If you only have a small quantity of seed then it would be safer to sow this in a cold frame in the winter. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
