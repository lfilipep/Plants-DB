See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",A. rufa parvifolia. Dunn.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; South Wall. By. West Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[126, 183]. The globose fruit is hairless when fully ripe and up to 45mm long[183, 198, 266]. It contains a number of small seeds, but these are easily eaten with the fruit[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Succeeds in semi-shade but full sun is best for fruit production[200]. Prefers a sheltered position[200]. One report says that plants are not fully hardy in the colder parts of the country[219]. Young spring growth is susceptible to frost damage[160]. Fruits are formed on second year wood and also on fruit spurs on older wood[126], any pruning is best carried out in the winter[219]. The flowers have a soft, aromatic perfume[245]. This is a climbing plant, supporting itself by twining around branches etc[200]. At least one named variety has been developed for its edible fruit[183]. Plants have been seen in fruit at Kew[11]. This species is a good pollinator for A. arguta cordifolia[183]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Another report says that both sexes are on one plant[182].","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[133]. It is probably best if the seed is given 3 months stratification[113], either sow it in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in November or as soon as it is received. Fresh seed germinates in 2 - 3 months at 10°c, stored seed can take longer[133]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. When the plants are 30cm or more tall, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[K]. Most seedlings are male[126]. The seedlings are subject to damping off, they must be kept well ventilated[113]. Cuttings of softwood as soon as ready in spring in a frame[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of ripe wood, October/November in a frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
