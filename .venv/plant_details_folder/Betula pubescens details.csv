17,Edible Parts,"Flowers: ,Leaves: "
18,Edible Uses,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Sap: usually of trees and usually but not always used as a drink.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"cooked or dried, ground into a powder then used with cereals for making bread etc[2, 15, 46]. Inner bark is generally only seen as a famine food, used when other forms of starch are not available or are in short supply[177, K]. Sap - raw or cooked. A sweet flavour[2, 15, 177]. Harvested in early spring, before the leaves unfurl, by tapping the trunk. The flow is best on sunny days following a heavy frost. The sap is often concentrated into a sugar by boiling off the water. Between 4 and 7 litres can be drawn off a mature tree in a day and this will not kill the tree so long as the tap hole is filled up afterwards[115]. However, prolonged or heavy tapping will kill the tree. A beer can be fermented from the sap. An old English recipe for the beer is as follows:- ""To every Gallon of Birch-water put a quart of Honey, well stirr'd together; then boil it almost an hour with a few Cloves, and a little Limon-peel, keeping it well scumm'd. When it is sufficiently boil'd, and become cold, add to it three or four Spoonfuls of good Ale to make it work...and when the Test begins to settle, bottle it up . . . it is gentle, and very harmless in operation within the body, and exceedingly sharpens the Appetite, being drunk ante pastum.""[269]. Young leaves - raw or cooked[15, 177]. Young catkins[15]. No more details are given. A tea is made from the leaves[15] and another tea is made from the essential oil in the inner bark[21]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseborrheic: Used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI)."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antirheumatic  Antiseborrheic  Astringent  Bitter  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Lithontripic  Miscellany  Skin  UrinaryAnti-inflammatory, cholagogue, diaphoretic[21, 165, 201]. The bark is diuretic and laxative[7]. The inner bark is bitter and astringent, it is used in treating intermittent fevers[4]. An oil obtained from the inner bark is astringent and is used in the treatment of various skin afflictions, especially eczema and psoriasis[4, 238]. The bark is usually obtained from trees that have been felled for timber and can be distilled at any time of the year[238]. The buds are balsamic[7]. The young shoots and leaves secrete a resinous substance which has acid properties, when combined with alkalis it is a tonic laxative[4]. The leaves are anticholesterolemic and diuretic[7]. They also contain phytosides, which are effective germicides[7]. An infusion of the leaves is used in the treatment of gout, dropsy and rheumatism, and is recommended as a reliable solvent of kidney stones[4]. The young leaves and leaf buds are harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238]. A decoction of the leaves and bark is used for bathing skin eruptions[4]. The vernal sap is diuretic[4]. The boiled and powdered wood has been applied to chafed skin[257]. Moxa is made from the yellow fungous excrescences of the wood, which sometimes swell out of the fissures[4]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Betula species for infections of the urinary tract, kidney and bladder stones, rheumatism  (see [302] for critics of commission E)."
22,Other Uses,"Adhesive: Glues.,Besom: A type of broom.,Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Compost: Plants used for activating compost heaps, providing biomass for composting, using as instant compost etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Fungicide: Arrests the growth of, or kills, fungi.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Polish: Plants used to give a shine to metals, wood etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.,Waterproofing: Does what it says. See also Pitch and Oil.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The bark is used to make drinking vessels, canoe skins, roofing tiles etc. It is waterproof, durable, tough and resinous[11, 61]. Only the outer bark is removed, this does not kill the tree. It is most easily removed in late spring to early summer. The bark was pressed flat and stored until the following spring. When required for making canoes it would be heated over a fire to make it pliable for shaping to the canoe frame[257]. A pioneer species, it readily invades old fields, cleared or burnt-over land and creates conditions suitable for other woodland trees to become established. Since it is relatively short-lived and intolerant of shade, it is eventually out-competed by these trees[11, 186]. A tar-oil is obtained from the white bark in spring. It has fungicidal properties and is also used as an insect repellent[4, 14, 61, 100]. It makes a good shoe polish[61]. Another report says that an essential oil is obtained from the bark and this, called 'Russian Leather' has been used as a perfume[245]. A glue is made from the sap. Cordage can be made from the fibres of the inner bark. This inner bark can also be separated into thin layers and used as a substitute for oiled paper[4]. A decoction of the inner bark is used to preserve cordage, it is rich in tannin. The bark contains up to 16% tannin[223]. A brown dye is obtained from the inner bark. An oil similar to Wintergreen oil (obtained from Gaultheria procumbens) is obtained from the inner bark[21, 61]. It is used medicinally and also makes a refreshing tea[21]. The young branches are very flexible and are used to make whisks, besoms etc[6]. They are also used in thatching and to make wattles[4]. The leaves are a good addition to the compost heap, improving fermentation[20]. A black paint is obtained from the soot of the plant[61]. A high quality charcoal is obtained from the bark. It is used by artists, painters etc.  - soft, light, durable. It is used for a wide range of purposes including furniture, tool handles, carving, toys etc[100, 238]. It is a source of charcoal that is used by artists and is also pulped and used for making paper[238]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in a well-drained light loamy soil in a sunny position[11, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates a wet position[11, 24], succeeding in poorly drained soils[186]. Fairly wind tolerant[200]. Prefers an acid soil. A very ornamental tree and fast growing, capable of growing 1 metre a year but it is short-lived[186]. It is one of the first trees to colonize open land and it creates a suitable environment for other woodland trees to follow[11]. These trees eventually shade out the birch trees[186]. Trees take about 15 years from seed to produce their own seed[98]. Although closely related, it does not usually hybridize with B. pendula[11]. It hybridizes freely with B. pendula according to another report[186]. A superb tree for encouraging wildlife, it has over 200 associated insect species[24, 30]. A good plant to grow near the compost heap, aiding the fermentation process[14, 20]. It is also a good companion plant, its root activity working to improve the soil[14]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a light position in a cold frame[78, 80, 113, 134]. Only just cover the seed and place the pot in a sunny position[78, 80, 134]. Spring sown seed should be surface sown in a sunny position in a cold frame[113, 134]. If the germination is poor, raising the temperature by covering the seed with glass can help[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. If you have sufficient seed, it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed, either as soon as it is ripe or in the early spring - do not cover the spring sown seed. Grow the plants on in the seedbed for 2 years before planting them out into their permanent positions in the winter[78, 80, 113, 134]."
