19,Edible Uses Description,"ves - raw or cooked [46 , 301 ]. Adds a pungent flavour to salads that stimulates the salivary glands whilst having a numbing effect on the tongue and lips [301 , 348 ]. Eating the leaves is a memorable experience. They have a smell similar to any green leafy vegetable. The taste, however, is somewhat reminiscent of Echinacea, but lacking the bitter and sometimes nauseating element of that plant. First, a strong, spicy warmth spreads outward across one's tongue, turning into a prickling sensation. With this the salivary glands leap into action, pumping out quantities of saliva. As the prickling spreads, it mellows into an acidic (slightly metallic) sharpness accompanied by tingling, and then numbness. The numbness fades after a time (two to twenty minutes, depending on the person and amount eaten), and the pungent aftertaste may linger for an hour or more [372 ]. A very popular ingredient in Amazonian soup dishes, and has become the favourite vegetable for Europeans living in Madagascar [301 ]. A concentrated extract of the plant, sometimes called jambu oil or jambu extract, is used as a flavoring agent in foods, chewing gum, and chewing tobacco. It is described as having a citrus, herbal, tropical or musty odor, and its taste can be described as pungent, cooling, tingling, numbing, or effervescent.",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Sialagogue: Stimulates the secretion of saliva.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Anthelmintic  Antibacterial  Antifungal  Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Dysentery  Malaria  Sialagogue  TonicThe most common and widespread medicinal use is to treat toothache and throat and gum infections [299 ]. Worldwide the flower heads are used either fresh or dried and powdered, but the use of roots and leaves has been recommended as well [299 ]. The plant is further recommended as a cure for dysentery and rheumatism, and to enhance the immune system. It is used against blood parasites, especially against malaria, both prophylactic and curative [299 ]. The leaves are sialagogue [348 ]. The leaves and flower heads are analgesic, anthelmintic, antibacterial and antifungal [372 ]. Some of the medicinal compounds are destroyed by desiccation or freezing [372 ]. In-vitro studies have shown strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Staphylococcus. Also Candida albicans is inhibited [299 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Containers: Plants, such as gourds, that can be used as containers. Does not include baskets or containers made from wood.,Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Cut flowers: Cut flowers are flowers or flower buds (often with some stem and leaf) for decorative use.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Use as an natural insecticide has proved effective against yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and corn earworm moth (Helicoverpa zea) larvae. [299]. Used widely as an ornamental because of the attractive colourful heads[299]. Attracts fireflies when in bloom. Jambu extract can also be used in cosmetics and shampoos. Flowers are good for cutting, drying and preserving. This plant is attractive to bees, butterflies and/or birds. Suitable for growing in containers.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers moist, well-drained, black (high organic content) soil. Prefers a sunny position[200]. Tolerates part sun to full sun. It grows in regions with an average temperature of 26°C.  The rainfall is 2,700 mm per year.  The relative humidity is 85%.  It is damaged by frost. Soil pH requirements: 6.1 (mildly acidic) to 7.5 (neutral). Plants have escaped from cultivation in New Caledonia, where the species is classified as 'Invasive'[305]. There is a wild form with much stronger flavoured leaves that is occasionally used in salads but is more commonly used medicinally, especially to treat toothache[301, K]. A cultivated form 'Oleracea' has milder flavoured leaves and has become very popular in Brazil both as a salad and an addition to soups[301].[1-4].  In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length. Bloom Time: Mid Summer to Early Fall. Blooms repeatedly.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - requires a temperature of 21°c to germinate[299]. Germination takes place in about 2 weeks[423]. Cuttings when the plant is not in flower[299].,
