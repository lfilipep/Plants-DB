13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Elaeagnus macrophylla is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3 m (9ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[105, 177]. A very acceptable rich flavour when fully ripe, though it is somewhat astringent before then[K]. A potentially very valuable crop, ripening as it does in April and May[K]. We are not sure how reliable a crop it is though, some plants bear very heavy crops whilst others rarely bear fruit[K]. The fruit is up to 30mm long and contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. A mild flavour, that has a hint of peanut, it can be eaten in quantity[K]. It can be eaten together with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous[K].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerThe fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].",
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as a hedge in exposed positions, they are very tolerant of maritime exposure[75, 200]. Reasonably fast-growing and providing a dense cover, it gives a very good protection from the wind[K]. Plants are very tolerant of regular trimming, they can also be cut back almost to the ground and will resprout from the base[K].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils that are well-drained[11, 200]. Prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in poor soils and in dry soils[11, 200]. Succeeds in sun or shade[11, 200]. Plants are very tolerant of maritime exposure[75]. This species is hardy to about -15°c[184], succeeding in the warmer counties of Britain. This is a plant with a very big potential as a commercial fruit crop. The fruit ripens outdoors in Britain in April, a season where traditionally there is no fresh fruit available. The fruit is of a reasonable size, has a very nice flavour when fully ripe and also has a fairly large edible seed[K]. Some research needs to be carried out in order to find the conditions that are necessary to ensure good crops - some plants fruit very heavily whilst others have very light or no crops[K]. This is the second of the evergreen Elaeagnus species to ripen in the spring, about a week or 10 days later than E. cordifolia[K]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. Plants can succumb to wind-rock in very wet seasons[75]. Plants are sometimes damaged by voles[75]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%. Allied to E. pungens and E. glabra[11]. The flowers are very aromatic[184], their aroma pervading the garden on calm days[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate freely within 4 weeks, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage[78]. It is best to take the cuttings in June[202]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November in a frame. Leave for 12 months. Fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",
