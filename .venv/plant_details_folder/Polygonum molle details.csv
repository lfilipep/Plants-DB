4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been made for this species, there have been reports that some members of this genus can cause photosensitivity in susceptible people. Many species also contain oxalic acid (the distinctive lemony flavour of sorrel) - whilst not toxic this substance can bind up other minerals making them unavailable to the body and leading to mineral deficiency. Having said that, a number of common foods such as sorrel and rhubarb contain oxalic acid and the leaves of most members of this genus are nutritious and beneficial to eat in moderate quantities. Cooking the leaves will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",
5,Habitats,"Forest, scrub and damp ground, often gregarious, 900 - 4250 metres[51, 187]. Slopes, forests, grassy places and thickets in valleys at elevations of 1300 - 3500 metres[266].",

22,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,Plants are very fast growing and are used to reclothe and stabilize land slips[146]. They are best spaced about 1.2 metres apart each way[208].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Succeeds in an ordinary garden soil[1] but prefers a moisture retentive not too fertile soil in sun or part shade[200]. Repays generous treatment[1]. A very fast growing plant[146]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233].,
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. Germination is usually free and easy. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer if they have reached sufficient size. If not, overwinter them in a cold frame and plant them out the following spring after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",
