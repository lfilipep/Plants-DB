Plants like growing with their roots in the shade but their stems reaching up into the light[245]. This species is not fully hardy in Britain, plants tolerate temperatures down to about -10°c when sheltered from cold drying winds[200]. They grow best along the west coast of the country, especially in Scotland and N. Ireland[11]. The sub-species D. spinosa hookeri.(Dun.)Reiche. is usually employed for its medicinal virtues[238]. There is at least one named variety selected for its ornamental value[200]. The flowers are softly honey-scented[245]. A slow-growing plant[202]. Any pruning to retain shape is best done in the spring[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in a greenhouse. Do not allow the compost to become dry. Grow on the seedlings in a bright filtered light[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Requires humid conditions and bottom heat at 16°c[200]. Overwinter in a cold frame and grow on for another year before planting out[200]. Division of suckers in the dormant season[202].",
