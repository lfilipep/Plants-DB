Grows well in heavy clay soils. Thrives in full sun so long as the soil does not dry out[200], otherwise it is best grown in partial shade[187]. This species tolerates slightly drier conditions than M. guttatus, it prefers a rich soil in light woodland[200]. Hardy to at least -20°c[187]. Another report says that plants are only hardy in the milder parts of Britain[233]. There is some confusion over the naming of this plant, the entry on edibility may refer to M. luteus, which is closely related to this species.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only lightly cover the seed[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If you have sufficient seed it can also be sown in situ in late spring after the last expected frosts[200]. Division in spring[200]. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of softwood, 5cm long in spring or summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
