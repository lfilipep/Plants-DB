Mitsuba is commonly cultivated as a vegetable in Japan, there are some named varieties[183]. It is usually grown as an annual[206]. It is closely allied to C. canadensis, and is considered to be no more than a synonym of that species by some botanists[200]. This plant is adored by slugs and snails and must be protected when small or when new growth is emerging in the spring[K]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - sow April in a greenhouse. Germination is usually rapid, prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. The ideal temperature for sowing is about 25°c, though seed does germinate at higher and lower temperatures[206]. Seed can also be sown in early autumn[206].
