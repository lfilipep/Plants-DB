23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen. Easily grown in a well-drained sandy soil in full sun[90, 200]. Prefers a moderately rich soil[1]. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -5°c[214]. A very ornamental plant[1], there are many named varieties[200]. When grown outdoors in Britain the bulb often gradually deteriorates each year due to a lack of summer heat that is required to fully ripen the bulb[1]. Eventually they look more like a bluebell than a hyacinth[K]. Bulbs should be planted out 7cm deep in October[1]. The flowers have a strong sweet fragrance that can fill the air for a considerable distance[245]. Special Features:All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Suitable for cut flowers, Fragrant flowers."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in a light sandy soil[1]. If sown thinly, the seedlings can be left in their pots for the first year, though give them regular liquid feeds to make sure that they get sufficient nutrient. Prick out the seedlings about 3 to a pot and grow on for 1 - 2 more years before planting out into their permanent positions when they are dormant[K]. Division in the autumn. Plant the small offsets 5cm deep[1]. Larger bulbs can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, but it is best to pot up smaller bulbs and grow them on for a year in a cold frame before planting them out when dormant in late summer. Scooping and scoring."
