1,Common Name,"Whitebeam, Chess-apple"
2,Family,Rosaceae
3,USDA hardiness,4-8
4,Known Hazards,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Woods and scrub, usually on chalk or limestone[3, 9, 13, 17]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Sorbus aria is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 8 m (26ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution."

17,Edible Parts,Fruit: 
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked and used in preserves etc. The fruit is usually bletted if it is going to be eaten raw[2, 3, 5, 105, 115, 183]. This involves storing the fruit in a cool dry place until it is almost but not quite going rotten. At this stage the fruit has a delicious taste, somewhat like a luscious tropical fruit[K]. Fruit from some trees has a pleasant mild flavour and a mealy texture, we like eating small quantities of it. The fruit can also be dried and ground into a powder and mixed with cereals such as wheat[2, 46, 66]. The fruit is about 10 - 12mm across[200]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diuretic  Emmenagogue  LaxativeBoth the flowers and the fruit are mildly diuretic, laxative and emmenagogue[9]. An infusion is used in the treatment of painful menstruation, constipation and kidney disorders[9]."
22,Other Uses,"Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Very tolerant of exposed maritime conditions, it makes a good windbreak tree near the coast[75, 200]. A useful pioneer species, especially on chalky soils and in windy situations[186, K].  - hard, heavy, close grained. Used for beams etc[11, 115]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most reasonably good soils in an open sunny position[11]. Tolerates acid sands and thin chalky soils[98, 200]. Does well on heavy clays[200]. Tolerates light shade[188], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. Very tolerant of atmospheric pollution and of exposed maritime positions[186]. The whitebeam is one of the first colonizers of chalk scrub[186]. As well as being a good pioneer species for this situation, it will often survive through the development to woodland[186]. There are several named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188]. Trees cast a fairly dense shade when mature[186]. Regenerating well after cutting, it is suitable for coppicing[186]. The fruit is very attractive to birds[11]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring."
