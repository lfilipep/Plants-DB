13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Castanea pumila ashei is a deciduous Shrub growing to 5 m (16ft 5in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - raw or cooked[2, 61, 105]. Sweet with a nice nutty flavour[46, 82, 183], it is very acceptable raw[142, 161, K]. When baked it becomes even sweeter and develops a floury texture, it makes an excellent potato or cereal substitute[K]. The seed is quite small, about half the size of C. dentata[183]. Sold in local markets in America[82].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Astringent  TonicThe leaves contain tannin and are antiperiodic, astringent and tonic[46, 61, 213]. An infusion of the leaves has been used as an external wash for the feverish condition common to colds[213, 257].",
22,Other Uses,"Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The bark, leaves, wood and seed husks all contain tannin.  - hard, strong, light. Used for fence posts etc[46, 61].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good well-drained slightly acid loam but succeeds in dry soils[1, 11, 200]. Once established, it is very drought tolerant[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of highly acid, infertile dry sands[200]. Averse to calcareous soils but succeeds on harder limestones[11, 200]. Although it is winter-hardy in most areas of Britain, this species only really thrives in areas with hot summers[200]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. Produces suckers, eventually forming a thicket[182]. An excellent soil-enriching understorey in pine forests[200]. Flowers are produced on wood of the current year's growth[229]. Plants are fairly self-sterile[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Fruits are produced within 2 - 3 years from seed[117]. One report dealing with the type species states that it never fruits in Britain[11]. However, a bush at Wisley fruits well in most years[K]. Therefore it is hoped that this sub-species will also fruit in Britain[K]. There are a few plants at Hilliers Arboretum, but we have never seen them produce fertilized fruits[K]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - where possible sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in a seed bed outdoors[78]. The seed must be protected from mice and squirrels. The seed has a short viability and must not be allowed to become dry. It can be stored in a cool place, such as the salad compartment of a fridge, for a few months if it is kept moist, but check regularly for signs of germination. The seed should germinate in late winter or early spring. If sown in an outdoor seedbed, the plants can be left in situ for 1 - 2 years before planting them out in their permanent positions. If grown in pots, the plants can be put out into their permanent positions in the summer or autumn, making sure to give them some protection from the cold in their first winter[K]. Division of suckers in winter[200]. They can be planted straight out into their permanent positions.",
