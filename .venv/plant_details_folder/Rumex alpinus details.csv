0,Rumex alpinus,"Alpine Dock, Munk's rhubarb",Polygonaceae,4-8,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].","Along the banks of streams and by the sides of roads, it is also found near human habitations, in hilly areas[9].",C. and S. Europe to W. Asia. Naturalized in Britain[17].,(4 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexAlpinus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RumexAlpinus2.jpg",,"Rumex alpinus is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.2 m (4ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in July, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Cultivated Beds;,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked[1, 2, 5, 21, 22, 46, 183]. They can also be dried for later use[12]. A strong flavour, the leaves can be used in salads in late autumn to the spring, but are better cooked like spinach[K]. The fresh leaves can be available for most months of the year, only dying down for a short period in severe winters[K]. The leaves often become bitter in the summer[K]. In taste trials, this has proved to be a very popular autumn and spring cooked leaf, making an excellent spinach[K].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  LaxativeThe root is astringent and laxative[4, 9]. It has a regulatory effect on the digestive system, similar to but weaker than rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum)[4]. It can act either as a laxative or a cure for diarrhoea according to dosage[4]. The root is harvested in early spring and dried for later use[4].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"Dark green to brown and dark grey dyes can be obtained from the roots, they do not need a mordant[168].",,"A very easily grown and tolerant plant[K], it succeeds in most soils, preferring a moist moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. Alpine dock was at one time cultivated for its edible leaves, though it has now fallen out of favour to be replaced by less strong-tasting plants[2, 200, K]. This is a pity because it is a very productive and useful vegetable and can produce its leaves all through the winter if the weather is not too severe[K]. A very important plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterflies[30].","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. The seed can also be sown as soon as it is ripe when it will germinate rapidly and will provide edible leaves from early spring the following year. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring. Division is easy at almost any time of the year, though the plants establish more rapidly in the spring[K]. Use a sharp spade or knife to divide the rootstock, ensuring that there is at least one growth bud on each section of root. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
