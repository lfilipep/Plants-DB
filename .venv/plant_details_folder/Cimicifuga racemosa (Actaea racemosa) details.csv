Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Black cohosh is a traditional remedy of the North American Indians where it was used mainly to treat women's problems, especially painful periods and problems associated with the menopause[254]. A popular and widely used herbal remedy, it is effective in the treatment of a range of diseases[4]. The root is alterative, antidote, antirheumatic, antispasmodic, astringent, cardiotonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, hypnotic, sedative, tonic and vasodilator[4, 7, 21, 46, 57, 165, 192, 222]. It is harvested in the autumn as the leaves die down, then cut into pieces and dried[4]. The root is toxic in overdose, it should be used with caution and be completely avoided by pregnant women[222]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The medically active ingredients are not soluble in water so a tincture of the root is normally used[222]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism, as a sedative and an emmenagogue[213]. It is traditionally important in the treatment of women's complaints, acting specifically on the uterus it eases uterine cramps and has been used to help in childbirth[222, 268]. Research has shown that the root has oestrogenic activity and is thought to reduce levels of pituitary luteinizing hormone, thereby decreasing the ovaries production of progesterone[222, 254]. The root is also hypoglycaemic, sedative and anti-inflammatory[222]. Used in conjunction with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) it is 78% effective in treating hot flushes and other menopausal problems[254]. An extract of the root has been shown to strengthen the male reproductive organ in rats[222]. The root contains salicylic acid, which makes it of value in the treatment of various rheumatic problems - it is particularly effective in the acute stage of rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica and chorea[268]. Its sedative action makes it useful for treating a range of other complaints including tinnitus and high blood pressure[254]. The roots are used to make a homeopathic remedy[232]. This is used mainly for women, especially during pregnancy[232]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Cimicifuga racemosa (Actaea racemosa) for climacteric (menopause) complaints, Premenstrual syndrome. (see [302] for critics of commission E).",

24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1]. Only just cover the seed. It germinates in 1 - 12 months or even longer at 15°c[164]. The seed does not store well and soon loses its viability[200], stored seed may germinate better if given 6 - 8 weeks warm stratification at 15°c and then 8 weeks cold stratification[164]. Prick out the young seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Division in spring or autumn[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",
