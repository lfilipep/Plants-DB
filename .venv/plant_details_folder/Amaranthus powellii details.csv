0,Amaranthus powellii,Powell's Amaranth,Amaranthaceae,6-11,"No members of this genus are known to be poisonous, but when grown on nitrogen-rich soils they are known to concentrate nitrates in the leaves. This is especially noticeable on land where chemical fertilizers are used. Nitrates are implicated in stomach cancers, blue babies and some other health problems. It is inadvisable, therefore, to eat this plant if it is grown inorganically.",Waste places[43].,Eastern N. America,(2 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusPowellii.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/AmaranthusPowellii2.jpg","The leaves, stems and seeds of Powell's Amaranth are edible and highly nutritious. The leaves are cooked as a spinach. The seed is also cooked and then used with cereal flours in porridge and breads. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico and has been introduced to other continents, including Australia and Europe. Common names: Powell's amaranth and green amaranth.","Amaranthus powellii is a ANNUAL growing to 1.8 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is frost tender. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Leaves - cooked as a spinach[257]. Seed - cooked[257]. Used as a flour[161, 177]. Very small but easy to harvest and very nutritious. The seed can be cooked whole, and becomes very gelatinous like this, but it is rather difficult to crush all of the small seeds in the mouth and thus some of the seed will pass right through the digestive system without being assimilated[K].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Yellow and green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168].,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know how well it will grow in Britain, though it should succeed as a spring-sown annual. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a well-drained fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Requires a hot sheltered position if it is to do well[K]. Plants should not be given inorganic fertilizers, see notes above on toxicity. Most if not all members of this genus photosynthesize by a more efficient method than most plants. Called the 'C4 carbon-fixation pathway', this process is particularly efficient at high temperatures, in bright sunlight and under dry conditions[196].",Seed - sow late spring in situ. An earlier sowing can be made in a greenhouse and the plants put out after the last expected frosts. Germination is usually rapid and good if the soil is warm[133]. A drop in temperature overnight aids germination[133]. Cuttings of growing plants root easily[206].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
