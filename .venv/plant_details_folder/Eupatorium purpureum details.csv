Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Diuretic  Nervine  Tonic  UrinaryGravel root was used by the native N. American Indians as a diaphoretic to induce perspiration and break a fever. The plant was quickly adopted by the white settlers and still finds a use in modern herbalism[268]. The whole plant, but especially the root, is astringent, diuretic, nervine and tonic[4, 21, 165]. It works particularly on the genito-urinary system and the uterus[238]. Especially valuable as a diuretic and stimulant, as well as an astringent tonic[4], a tea made from the roots and leaves has been used to eliminate stones from the urinary tract, to treat urinary incontinence in children, cystitis, urethritis, impotence etc[222, 254, 268]. It is also said to be helpful in treating rheumatism and gout by increasing the removal of waste from the kidneys[254, 257]. The leaves and flowering stems are harvested in the summer before the buds open and are dried for later use. The roots are harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Massing, Specimen, Woodland garden. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil that is well-drained but moisture retentive in sun or part shade[200]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[187]. The bruised leaves have a vanilla-like odour[213]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Butterflies are attracted to this plant[187].  Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage, Naturalizing, Wetlands plant, Attracts butterflies, Suitable for cut flowers. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Very easy, the clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions.",
