They take about two years to form an effective cover[197].",,"Succeeds in a sunny position in most well-drained soils[182, 200]. Established plants are fairly drought resistant[190], they tolerate maritime exposure[182]. This species grows well in the milder areas of Britain where it tolerates temperatures down to about -15°c[184]. This name covers a range of hybrids of garden origin involving B. compacta, B. greyi. and B. laxifolia[200]. There are a number of named forms selected for their ornamental value. 'Sunshine' makes a good wind resistant hedge in maritime areas[11, 200]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and soon regrow after being cut right back into old wood[190].","Seed - probably best sown on the surface of a freely draining compost in the greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed can be surface sown in the greenhouse in early spring. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. This plant is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed.
