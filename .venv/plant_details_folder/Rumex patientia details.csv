0,Rumex patientia,Herb Patience,Polygonaceae,5-10,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",Waste land in Britain[17].,Europe.

Rumex patientia x tianschanicus. Staple Crop: balanced carb and Industrial Crop: biomass.,"Rumex patientia is a PERENNIAL growing to 1.5 m (5ft) by 0.5 m (1ft 8in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen in August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,,Leaves: ,,"Leaves - raw or cooked[1, 2, 5, 37, 177]. Eaten like spinach or made into a delicious puree, they are often mixed with a quarter part of sorrel in order to add flavour to them[183]. A fairly mild flavour[183], they make an excellent vegetable[K]. The leaves are produced very early in the year[27].

Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar.
