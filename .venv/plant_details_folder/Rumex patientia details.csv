4,Known Hazards,"Plants can contain quite high levels of oxalic acid, which is what gives the leaves of many members of this genus an acid-lemon flavour. Perfectly alright in small quantities, the leaves should not be eaten in large amounts since the oxalic acid can lock-up other nutrients in the food, especially calcium, thus causing mineral deficiencies. The oxalic acid content will be reduced if the plant is cooked. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238]."

A fairly mild flavour[183], they make an excellent vegetable[K]. The leaves are produced very early in the year[27]. Carbon Farming - The hybrid Rumex patientia x tianschanicus is a good staple crop: balanced carb."

24,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, preferring a moist moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Formerly cultivated for its edible leaves[1, 2, 37, 50], these can be available in early February if the winter is mild[K]. An important food plant for the caterpillars of many species of butterfly[30].The hybrid Rumex patientia x tianschanicus (Hybrid sorrel) is a good Carbon Farming plant. Rumex patientia x tianschanicus cultivation: new crop. Management: standard, coppice. Staple Crop: balanced carb. Industrial Crop: biomass."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division in spring."
