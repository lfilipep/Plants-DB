0,Chrysothamnus nauseosus,Rubber Rabbitbrush,Asteraceae or Compositae,Coming soon,None known,"Dry sandy, gravelly, or heavy clayey and alkali soils in open places in sagebrush, juniper-pinyon and ponderosa-pine zones at low elevations and occasionally found at higher elevations[60, 269].",Western N. America - Canada to California.,(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ChrysothamnusNauseosus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ChrysothamnusNauseosus2.jpg",,"Chrysothamnus nauseosus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft 7in). It is in leaf all year, in flower from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.,"A gum obtained from the root is used for chewing[46, 61, 95, 257].","Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Miscellany  Odontalgic  Pectoral  Skin  TBA decoction of the twigs has been used in the treatment of toothaches, coughs and chest pains[257]. An infusion of the flowering stems has been used in the treatment of colds and TB[257]. An infusion of the leaves and stems has been used to treat colds, diarrhoea, stomach cramps etc[257]. It has also been used externally as a wash for sores and skin eruptions, especially smallpox[257]. The plant shows slight bactericidal activity[269]. In small doses, the extracts lowered the blood pressure briefly in rabbits. In large doses, the fall in blood pressure was pronounced, accompanied by circulatory and respiratory failure[269].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Stuffing: Used in making soft toys, mattresses, pillows etc.","The plant is a source of latex, used in making rubber[46, 61, 95]. There is no commercially viable method of extracting it as yet[212]. This species has been identified as one of the more promising species from western N. America for the production of biocrude (hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon-like chemical fraction of plants which may be extracted by organic solvents and upgraded to liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks). Finding the cyclohexane extract to be 15.1%, the ethanol extract 20.8%, McLaughlin and Hoffmann (1982) calculated 13.2 kBTU/lb. in the extractables, a biomass yield of ca 4.5 MT/ha or 12.5 bbls, at a per barrel cost of $50.00 or $13.10/million BTU[269]. The leaves have been used as a sanitary towel, especially after childbirth[257]. A green dye is obtained from the bark[168]. A yellow-gold dye is obtained from the flowers[95, 168]. The growing plant repels insects[99]. The cottony fruiting heads are used as a stuffing material for pillows etc[99].",,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. This species thrives on poor soils and so is an indication that the land is poor, has been allowed to erode, has been overgrazed or in other ways neglected[212]. It is also reported to tolerate alkaline conditions, drought, heavy clays and poor soils[269]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sunny position and prefers a well-drained sandy soil[1, 11]. Plants do not require a rich soil[11]. They tolerate alkaline soils[200]. The sub-species C. nauseosus ssp.. consimilis, is characteristic of sites with highly saline soils[269].","Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in spring in a greenhouse and only just covering the seed. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
