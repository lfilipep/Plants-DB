It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Cardamindum majus. Tropaeolum elatum. Tropaeolum hortense. Trophaeum majus.,Cultivated Beds;,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.","Oil: Oil,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Oil: ","eaves - raw[2, 7, 14, 15, 27, 37]. A hot watercress flavour[183]. Very nice on its own or as a flavouring in mixed salads[K]. Rich in vitamin C[201]. The leaves are available from early summer until the first frosts of the autumn[K]. Flowers - raw[2, 7, 14, 27, 37, 183]. A very ornamental and tasty addition to the salad bowl, the flowers have a hot watercress flavour and are available all through the summer[7, K]. The flowers contain about 130mg vitamin C per 100g[218]. Young seed pods - raw[2, 14, 15, 27, 37]. These are even hotter than the flowers or leaves[K]. They can also be harvested whilst immature and pickled for use as a caper substitute[183, 238]. Seed - raw or cooked[105]. Very hot[K]. The mature seed can be ground into a powder and used as a pepper substitute[183]. The seed contains 26% protein and 10% oil[218].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antibiotic  Antifungal  Antiseptic  Aperient  Depurative  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Laxative  Stimulant  Urinary  Vitamin CNasturtium has long been used in Andean herbal medicine as a disinfectant and wound-healing herb, and as an expectorant to relieve chest conditions[254]. All parts of the plant appear to be antibiotic and an infusion of the leaves can be used to increase resistance to bacterial infections and to clear nasal and bronchial catarrh[254]. The remedy seems to both reduce catarrh formation and stimulate the clearing and coughing up of phlegm[254]. The leaves are antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, aperient, depurative, diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, laxative and stimulant[7, 21, 238]. A glycoside found in the plant reacts with water to produce an antibiotic[238]. The plant has antibiotic properties towards aerobic spore forming bacteria[61]. Extracts from the plant have anticancer activity[218]. The plant is taken internally in the treatment of genito-urinary diseases, respiratory infections, scurvy and poor skin and hair conditions[238]. Externally it makes an effective antiseptic wash and is used in the treatment of baldness, minor injuries and skin eruptions[238]. Any part of the plant can be used, it is harvested during the growing season and used fresh[238]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Tropaeolum majus Nasturtium for urinary tract infections, cough, bronchitis (see [302] for critics of commission E).","Insecticide: Kills insects.,Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The seeds yield a high percentage of a drying oil that can be used in making paints, varnish etc[7]. The growing plant attracts aphids away from other plants. Research indicates that aphids flying over plants with orange or yellow flowers do not stop, nor do they prey on plants growing next to or above the flowers[201]. An insecticide can be made from an infusion of leaves and soap flakes[201].",,"Landscape Uses:Container, Ground cover, Specimen, Woodland garden. Tolerates most soils[202], though it prefers a rich light well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade[14, 15, 37]. More and lusher leaves are produced when the plant is growing in a rich soil, though less flowers are produced[238]. When grown in a soil of low fertility the leaves are smaller and less lush, though more flowers are produced[200, K] The plant will also succeed in very poor soils[202]. It dislikes drought[37]. This species is not frost hardy in Britain but it is often grown in the flower garden as an annual when it will frequently self-sow[37]. In cold springs, however, the seed will often not germinate until mid or even late summer, which is too late to produce a reasonable crop[K]. A very ornamental and free-flowering species, it is often in bloom from early summer until cut down by the autumn frosts[K]. A climbing plant, it supports itself by twisting its leaf stalks around other plants etc[219]. There are many named varieties, some of which are low-growing forms that do not climb[183, 202, K]. The flowers have a very pleasing mild scent[245]. The Gleam Hybrid cultivars are more strongly scented[245]. A good companion plant in the garden, growing well with radishes, cabbages and fruit trees, improving their growth and flavour[14, 20]. A good companion for many plants, keeping many harmful insects at bay and also improving the growth and flavour of neighbouring crops[201]. Aphids on nasturtiums indicate a lime deficiency in the soil[20]. Slugs and snails love eating this plant, so it can be grown to attract them away from other plants[201]. The caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly can be a nuisance and often cause considerable damage to the leaves[219].
