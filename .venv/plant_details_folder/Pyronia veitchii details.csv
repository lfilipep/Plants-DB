The fruit is usually seedless.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,Prefers a good well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. This plant is a bi-generic hybrid between a quince and a pear[200]. The main flowering time is in the spring but plants often also produce flowers in the autumn[200].,"Seed - the fruit is usually seedless and, since it is a bi-generic hybrid, even if seed is produced it is not going to breed true. If you do come across seed then it is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Sow stored seed in late winter in a cold frame. The seed may take 12 months or more to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June/July in a frame, or of mature wood, November in a frame, can be tried but are unlikely to bring much success. The most productive means of propagation are budding or grafting.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
