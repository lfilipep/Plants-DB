18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[52]. A delicious aniseed flavour[183], the young leaves are best since older ones soon become tough. They are often used as a garnish on raw or cooked dishes or added to salads[183]. The leaves are difficult to store dried[200]. Leaf stalks and flower heads - raw or cooked[14, 37, 52, 183]. An aniseed flavour[K]. The aromatic seeds are used as a flavouring in cakes, bread, stuffings etc[2, 4, 5, 21, 27, 183]. The sprouted seeds can be added to salads[183]. An essential oil from the seed is used as a food flavouring in similar ways to the whole seed[1, 46, 183]. Root - cooked[53]. The flavour is somewhat parsnip-like. The leaves or the seeds can be used to make a herb tea[16, 183]."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Analgesic  Antiinflammatory  Antispasmodic  Aromatic  Carminative  Diuretic  Emmenagogue  Expectorant  Galactogogue  Hallucinogenic  Stimulant  Stomachic  UrinaryFennel is a commonly used household remedy, being useful in the treatment of a variety of complaints, especially those of the digestive system. The seeds, leaves and roots can be used, but the seeds are most active medicinally and are the part normally used[4]. An essential oil is often extracted from the seed for medicinal use, though it should not be given to pregnant women[4, 238]. The plant is analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, aromatic, carminative, diuretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, galactogogue, hallucinogenic, laxative, stimulant and stomachic[4, 7, 9, 21, 147, 165, 176, 192, 238]. Fennel is often added to purgatives in order to allay their tendency to cause gripe, and also to improve the flavour[4]. An infusion of the root is used to treat urinary disorders[238]. An essential oil obtained from the seed is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Normalising'[210]. The essential oil is bactericidal, carminative and stimulant[218]. Some caution is advised, see notes above on toxicity[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The seed yields up to 5% of an essential oil[1, 4, 46]. This is used medicinally, as a food flavouring, in toothpastes, soaps, perfumery, air fresheners etc[1, 46, 238]. The flavour of fennel oil depends upon its two main constituents. 'Fenchone' is a bitter tasting element whilst 'anethole' has a sweet anise-like flavour[238]. The proportions of these two ingredients varies according to strain and region. Plants growing in the Mediterranean and southern Europe usually have a sweet oil whilst plants growing in central and northern Europe usually produce a more bitter oil[238]. The quality of the oil also depends upon how well the seed has been dried - the oil from fully ripened and dried seeds being much sweeter and more fragrant[245]. The dried plant is an insect repellent[14, 53], the crushed leaves are effective for keeping dogs free of fleas[201]. The plant was formerly used as a strewing herb[201]. Yellow and brown dyes are obtained from the flowers and leaves combined[168]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1] but prefers a sunny dry position[200]. A cultivar of F. vulgare, this is not the genuine Florence fennel since it does not have swollen leaf stems[200]. It is used in much the same way as fennel. See F. vulgare azoricum for the genuine Florence fennel[K]. The flowers attract bees and hoverflies[24]. Fennel is a poor companion plant in the garden, it inhibits the growth of nearby plants, especially beans, tomatoes and kohl rabi[14, 18]. It is itself inhibited by wormwood and coriander[14, 18]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in early spring in situ[1]. Division in March as the new growth appears[16, 200]."
