The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils.

21,Other Uses Description,"A good ground cover plant[182, 208], succeeding in the heavy shade of trees and in dry shade[190, 200]. Very vigorous, it can swamp out small plants. For the densest cover plants should be cut to ground level each April[197]. A yellow-orange dye is obtained from the flowers.",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Cascades, Erosion control, Ground cover, Specimen. Easily grown in any reasonably good well-drained but moisture retentive soil.[1] Succeeds in dry soils[200] and in chalky soils[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in sun or shade but flowers better in a sunny position[11]. Grows well even in the shade of tall trees[1, 20, 31]. Tolerates poor soils and also drought when it is established[184]. A very cold-hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[184]. A very ornamental but very invasive plant, spreading by means of stolons[1, 182]. Seldom sets seed in Britain, probably due to our wet autumns[182]. Plants are often afflicted with rust disease[182, 200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 10°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood 10 - 12 cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Plant out in the following spring[200]. Cuttings of mature wood, 12 - 17cm with a heel, October/November in a sheltered position outdoors. Plants root by the spring. Good percentage[78]. Division in spring as new growth commences[78]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
