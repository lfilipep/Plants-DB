4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention of toxicity has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where many members have poisonous leaves. The pollen of many if not all species of rhododendrons is also probably toxic, being said to cause intoxication when eaten in large quantities[183]."

13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rhododendron periclymenoides is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. The flowers are pollinated by Birds, Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."

16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Uses Description,"An irregular growth on the twigs is eaten as a thirst quencher.  It can be sliced and mixed with tossed salads.  It is also pickled in spiced vinegar [1-4].  Rhododendron periclymenoides is highly toxic and all parts of the plant are poisonous and could be fatal if ingested. Honey which is made by bees who collect pollen from genus Rhododendron spp. is referred to as “mad honey”. Humans who ingest this honey begin exhibiting symptoms including salivation abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, paralysis and coma. as well as hypotension and other irregularities of cardiac rhythm."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A Perennial shrub. Sun Requirements: Full Sun to Full Shade. Water Preferences: Mesic/moist. It is relatively tolerant of dry sites. Soils in which R. periclymenoides grows best are typically acidic, rich in hummus and retain moisture but should still have some drainage. Soil pH Preferences: Very strongly acid (4.5 – 5.0) to Slightly acid (6.1 – 6.5). Fruiting Time: Late summer or early fall. Fruit: Edible to birds. Flowers: Showy. Fragrant. Flower Color: Pink, White. Flower Time: Spring. Suitable Locations: Bog gardening. Uses: Windbreak or Hedge. Cut Flower. Will Naturalize. Wildlife Attractant: Bees, Birds, Butterflies. Many animals and birds utilize shrubs like R. periclymenoides for cover on the forest floor. The roots also provide erosion control and protection for watersheds. Since lack of proper drainage can lead to root rot, North Carolina State University advises the use of raised beds if the plant is going to be grown in soil that contains a lot of clay. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn and given artificial light. Alternatively sow the seed in a lightly shaded part of the warm greenhouse in late winter or in a cold greenhouse in April. Surface-sow the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry[200]. Pot up the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a greenhouse for at least the first winter. Layering in late July. Takes 15 - 24 months[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, August in a frame. Difficult[78]."
