Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

A green dye is obtained from the seed pods[168]. Plants are heavily armed with thorns and make a good screen or hedge in warm temperate areas[200].,,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a well-drained sandy loam and a very sunny position[1]. Succeeds in dry soils and is drought tolerant. Succeeds in any good garden soil that is not excessively limey[11]. Most species become chlorotic on limey soils[200]. This species is probably very tender in Britain, but it has been grown outdoors in the mildest parts of Cornwall[11]. Closely related to A. pravissima[11]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sunny position in a warm greenhouse[1]. Stored seed should be scarified, pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then sown in a warm greenhouse in March. The seed germinates in 3 - 4 weeks at 25°c[133]. As soon as the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a sunny position in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame[78]. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in their permanent positions in late spring or early summer.
