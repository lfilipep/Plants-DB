Usually grows in patches, frequently in heavy clay and saline soils[212].","N. America - Saskatchewan to British Columbia, south to California and Mexico.",(4 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/GlycyrrhizaLepidota.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/GlycyrrhizaLepidota2.gif",,"Glycyrrhiza lepidota is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from July to August, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Shoots: ",,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 46, 61, 203]. Long, sweet and fleshy[105], when slow roasted they are said to taste like sweet potatoes[183, 207]. They can be used as a flavouring in other foods and can also be chewed raw as a masticatory[177, 183, 212], making an excellent tooth cleaner and also very good for teething children. The root contains 6% glycyrrhizin, a substance that is 50 times sweeter than sugar[183]. The tender young shoots can be eaten raw in the spring[183, 257].","Birthing aid: Used in facilitating birth, but not just to cause uterine contrctions.,Foot care: Plants that are used in various ways to treat foot problems.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Birthing aid  Foot care  Odontalgic  Poultice  TonicAmerican liquorice was widely employed medicinally by a number of native North American Indian tribes who used it in the treatment of a range of diseases[257]. All parts of the body are medicinal, but the roots are the most active part. This species has properties similar to other liquorices which are widely used medicinally, though this species is rather neglected in modern literature. An infusion of the root is used to speed the delivery of the placenta after childbirth, it is also used to treat coughs, diarrhoea, chest pains, fevers in children, stomach aches etc[207, 257]. It is also used as a wash or poultice on swellings[257]. The chewed root is retained in the mouth as a treatment for toothache and sore throats[207, 257]. The mashed leaves are used as a poultice on sores[207, 257]. The leaves have been placed in the shoes to absorb moisture[257].",,Nitrogen fixer. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch.,,"Requires a deep well cultivated fertile moisture-retentive soil for good root production[200]. Prefers a sandy soil with abundant moisture[238]. Slightly alkaline conditions produce the best plants[238]. A very deep-rooted plant, it can be difficult to eradicate once it is established[238]. Unless seed is required, the plant is usually prevented from flowering so that it puts more energy into producing good quality roots[238]. Plants are growing very well at Kew[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [1-2].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow spring or autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on for their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in late spring or early summer when in active growth. Plants are rather slow to grow from seed[238]. Division of the root in spring or autumn. Each division must have at least one growth bud. Autumn divisions can either be replanted immediately or stored in clamps until the spring and then be planted out[200]. It is best to pt up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a cold frame until they are established before planting them out in the spring or summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
