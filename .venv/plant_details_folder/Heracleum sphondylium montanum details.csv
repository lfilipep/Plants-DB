0,Heracleum sphondylium montanum,Cow Parsnip,Apiaceae or Umbelliferae,4-8,"Many members of this genus, including this species[65], contain furanocoumarins. These have carcinogenic, mutagenic and phototoxic properties. The fresh foliage can cause dermatitis[21]. If the juice and hairs of the outer skin are left on the face and mouth, they can cause blisters[212]. This effect is especially prevalent for people with fair complexions[256].","Rich damp soils of prairies and mountains, especially along streams and in open woods in Western N. America[212].",N.

Tastes like a swede[155, 183]. Used like potatoes, though it is considered to be poisonous by some writers[213]. The peeled stem can be eaten raw but is best cooked[2, 61, 183]. The unpeeled stem can be used when young, or just the inner tissue of older stems can be used, before the plants flower[85, 94]. For people not used to the flavour, they are best cooked in two changes of water when they make a tasty celery-like vegetable[213]. Another report says that, despite the strong odour of the leaves and outer skin, the peeled young stems are mild and sweet, resembling celery in flavour[256]. The stems cannot be eaten raw in large quantities because they give a burning sensation in the mouth[257]. The stems are highly nutritious, containing up to 18% protein[213]. Leaves and young shoots - raw or cooked[55, 85, 94, 118]. Cooked as greens or added to salads[183]. Young flowers[46, 61, 105]. No further details.

It is little used in modern herbalism, though perhaps it merits further investigation. All parts of the plant are antirheumatic, antispasmodic, carminative, febrifuge, odontalgic and stimulant[21, 94, 155, 172, 257]. The leaves are tonic[257]. They have been used in the treatment of colds[257]. A soothing drink made from the leaves is used to treat sore throats[257]. A poultice of the heated leaves has been applied to minor cuts, sore muscles etc[257]. An infusion of the fresh young stems has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257].

The root can be crushed, mixed with water and used as an antidandruff hair wash[257]. The root contains psoralen, which is being investigated for its use in the treatment of psoriasis, leukaemia and AIDS[222].
