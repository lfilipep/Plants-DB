The fresh foliage can cause dermatitis[21]. If the juice and hairs of the outer skin are left on the face and mouth, they can cause blisters[212]. This effect is especially prevalent for people with fair complexions[256].",

19,Edible Uses Description,"ltRoot - cooked[2, 46, 85, 94]. Tastes like a swede[155, 183]. Used like potatoes, though it is considered to be poisonous by some writers[213]. The peeled stem can be eaten raw but is best cooked[2, 61, 183]. The unpeeled stem can be used when young, or just the inner tissue of older stems can be used, before the plants flower[85, 94]. For people not used to the flavour, they are best cooked in two changes of water when they make a tasty celery-like vegetable[213]. Another report says that, despite the strong odour of the leaves and outer skin, the peeled young stems are mild and sweet, resembling celery in flavour[256]. The stems cannot be eaten raw in large quantities because they give a burning sensation in the mouth[257]. The stems are highly nutritious, containing up to 18% protein[213]. Leaves and young shoots - raw or cooked[55, 85, 94, 118]. Cooked as greens or added to salads[183]. Young flowers[46, 61, 105]. No further details. The dried seeds are used as a flavouring for soups, stews and potato salads[85, 183]. The dried base of the plant and ashes from the burnt leaves are used as a salt substitute[183].",
