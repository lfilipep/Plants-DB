The large leaves can be cooked as greens whilst the straight slender stems can be dried and used as walking sticks[200]. A good companion for celery and other aromatic plants since these seem to reduce insect predations[18, 20]. Grows badly with potatoes, beet and onions[20]. Grows well with potatoes, beet and onions according to another report[201].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April. Plant out in summer as space allows. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported.",
