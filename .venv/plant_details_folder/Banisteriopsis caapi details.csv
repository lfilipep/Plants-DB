Commonly used in the Amazonian rainforest, it is used shamanically as a tool to contact the spirits and bring healing, and is also used recreationally[ 254 , 317 , 434 ]. The shoots, roots and leaves, sometimes as an admixture with other species, are used by Indians for the preparation of a hallucinogenic beverage, used for special ceremonies or the roots and stems are chewed for this purpose[ 317 ]. The dried leaves are also smoked[ 317 ]. In addition to its use as an hallucinogenic, the plant is also emetic and purgative[ 254 ]. At low doses it is used as a mild detoxifier[ 254 ]. The plant contains an alkaloid, known variously as 'telepathin', yagein' or 'banisterine', which has a strongly stimulatory action on the nervous system[ 434 ]. The bark contains beta-carboline alkaloids, including harmine, harmaline and delta-tetrahycroharmine[ 254 ].
