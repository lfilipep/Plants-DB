It is very strong[1] and is particularly used in making high quality paper[171]. The leaves and stems are harvested in the summer, cut into usable pieces and soaked in clear water for 24 hours[189]. They are then cooked in lye for 2 hours and beaten in a bell mill. The plant is a source of a vegetable wax[57].

Currently, most commercial wax is made from paraffin - a fossil fuel.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Industrial Crop: Wax  Management: Hay  Regional CropEasily grown in an ordinary well-drained garden soil in full sun[1, 200].

The leaves of wild plants are often harvested and exported for their use in paper making[46].","Seed - sow March in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks, but make sure that the compost does not dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. The seed can also be sown outdoors in April. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
