See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil.",Parapyrola trichocarpa.,Woodland Garden Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit[58, 105, 177]. No more details are given. The fruit is about 10mm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,"A ground cover plant for a shady position[188], forming a carpet of growth[208]. Plants should be spaced about 25cm apart each way[208]. This species is probably not very worthwhile for ground cover in Britain because of its difficulty to cultivate[208].",,"Requires an open lime-free humus-rich soil and shade from direct sunlight[11, 200], succeeding also in deep shade[182]. Grows well in the shade of rhododendrons and other calcifuge shrubs[245]. A difficult plant to grow in cultivation[200], though it is easier than E. repens[182]. The flower buds require a period of chilling to about 2°c before they will open[200]. The flowers are sweetly scented[245]. They are produced in terminal racemes on the previous year's shoots[275].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a shady position in a cold frame[200]. Another report says that the seed requires no pre-treatment and can be sown in late winter in a cold frame[113]. Surface sow and place the pot in light shade, do not allow it to dry out[113]. The seed usually germinates in 3 - 5 weeks[113]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, pot up the seedlings into individual pots. Be very careful since they strongly resent root disturbance. Grow them on in light shade in the greenhouse and plant them out in their permanent positions in the late spring of their second years growth. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200].Take the cutting with a part of the previous year's growth[113]. (This report is unclear as to whether it means a heel of older wood or just a small section of older wood[K]) Plants self-layer and can be divided in the spring but this must be done with great care since they deeply resent root disturbance[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
