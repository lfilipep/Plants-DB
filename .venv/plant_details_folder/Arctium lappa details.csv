18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - raw or cooked[2, 7, 9, 14, 179]. Very young roots can be eaten raw, but older roots are normally cooked[206]. They can be up to 120cm long and 2.5cm wide at the top, but are best harvested when no more than 60cm long[206]. Old and very long roots are apt to become woody at the core[206]. Although it does not have much flavour the root can absorb other flavours[116]. Young roots have a mild flavour, but this becomes stronger as the root gets older[206]. The root is white but discolours rapidly when exposed to the air[206]. Roots can be dried for later use[213]. They contain about 2.5% protein, 0.14% fat, 14.5% carbohydrate, 1.17% ash[179]. The root contains about 45% inulin[240]. Inulin is a starch that cannot be digested by the human body, and thus passes straight through the digestive system. In some people this starch will cause fermentation in the gut, resulting in wind[K]. Inulin can be converted into a sweetener that is suitable for diabetics to eat[K]. Young leaves - raw or cooked[9, 12, 14, 62]. A mucilaginous texture[179]. The leaves contain about 3.5% protein, 1.8% fat, 19.4% carbohydrate, 8.8% ash[179]. Young stalks and branches - raw or cooked[2, 9, 52, 55, 62]. Used like asparagus or spinach[12, 183]. They taste best if the rind is removed[85, 117]. The leaf stalks can be parboiled and used as a substitute for cardoons[183]. The pith of the flowering stem can be eaten raw in salads, boiled or made into confections[4, 183]. A delicate vegetable, somewhat like asparagus in flavour[4]. The seeds can be sprouted and used like bean-sprouts[12, 52, 183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Alterative: Causes a gradual beneficial change in the body, usually through improved nutrition and elimination, without having any marked specific action.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Antiphlogistic: Reduces inflammation.,Antipsoriatic: Used to treat psoriasis (an autoimmune disease that affects the skin).,Aperient: A mild laxative.,Blood purifier: Purifies the blood.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholagogue: Increases the flow of bile and its discharge from the body.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Hypoglycaemic: Reduces the levels of sugar in the blood.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antibacterial  Antifungal  Antiphlogistic  Antipsoriatic  Aperient  Blood purifier  Carminative  Cholagogue  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Eczema  Hypoglycaemic  StomachicBurdock is one of the foremost detoxifying herbs in both Chinese and Western herbal medicine[254]. The dried root of one year old plants is the official herb, but the leaves and fruits can also be used[4]. It is used to treat conditions caused by an 'overload' of toxins, such as throat and other infections, boils, rashes and other skin problems[254]. The root is thought to be particularly good at helping to eliminate heavy metals from the body[254]. The plant is also part of a North American formula called essiac which is a popular treatment for cancer. Its effectiveness has never been reliably proven or disproven since controlled studies have not been carried out. The other herbs included in the formula are Rumex acetosella, Ulmus rubra and Rheum palmatum[254]. The plant is antibacterial, antifungal, carminative[9, 21, 147, 165, 176]. It has soothing, mucilaginous properties and is said to be one of the most certain cures for many types of skin diseases, burns, bruises etc[4, 244]. It is used in the treatment of herpes, eczema, acne, impetigo, ringworm, boils, bites etc[244]. The plant can be taken internally as an infusion, or used externally as a wash[244]. Use with caution[165]. The roots of one-year old plants are harvested in mid-summer and dried. They are alterative, aperient, blood purifier, cholagogue, depurative, diaphoretic, diuretic and stomachic[218, 222]. The seed is alterative, antiphlogistic, depurative, diaphoretic and diuretic[218]. Recent research has shown that seed extracts lower blood sugar levels[238]. The seed is harvested in the summer and dried for later use[254]. The crushed seed is poulticed onto bruises[222]. The leaves are poulticed onto burns, ulcers and sores[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc."
23,Other Uses Description,"The juice of the plant, when used as a friction, is said to have a stimulating action against baldness[7]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils when grown in partial shade[200]. Prefers a moist neutral to alkaline soil[238] and a sunny position in a heavy soil[22]. Plants are best grown in a light well-drained soil if the roots are required for culinary use[200, 206]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.6 to 7.8. The top growth dies back at temperatures a little above freezing, but the roots tolerate much lower temperatures[206] and can be left in the ground all winter to be harvested as required. Burdock is cultivated for its edible root in Japan, there are some named varieties[183]. Spring-sown seed produces edible roots in late summer and autumn, whilst autumn sown crops mature in the following spring or early summer[206]. Although the plants are quite large, it is best to grow them fairly close together (about 15cm apart, or in rows 30cm apart with the plants 5 - 8cm apart in the rows) since this encourages the development of long straight roots[206]. The seed head has little hooked prickles and these attach themselves to the hairs or clothing of passing creatures and can thus be carried for some considerable distance from the parent plant[4]. The plants usually self-sow freely[238]. The flowers are very attractive to bees and butterflies[206]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is fleshy. Thick or swollen - fibrous or tap root [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in situ in the autumn[200]. The seed can also be sown in spring[206]. Germination can be erratic, it is best to sow the seed in trays and plant out the young plants before the tap-root develops[206]. Seed requires a minimum temperature of 10°c, but a temperature of 20 - 25°c is optimum[206]. Germination rates can be improved by pre-soaking the seed for 12 hours or by scarification[206]. They germinate best in the light[206]. The autumn sowing should be made as late as possible because any plants with roots more than 3mm in diameter in the spring will quickly run to seed if cold temperatures are followed by daylengths longer than 12½ hours[206]."
