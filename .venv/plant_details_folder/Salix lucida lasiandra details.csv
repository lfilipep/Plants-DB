13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix lucida lasiandra is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil."

17,Edible Parts,Shoots: 
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Inner bark - raw or cooked. It can be dried, ground into a powder and then added to cereal flour for use in making bread etc. A very bitter flavour, it is a famine food that is only used when all else fails[172]. Young shoots - raw or cooked. They are not very palatable[172]."
20,Medicinal Uses,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The inner bark is haemostatic[257]. It has been applied externally to bleeding cuts[257]. A decoction of the branch tips has been used for soaking the feet and legs in the treatment of cramps[257]. A decoction of the leaves has been used to treat colds and sore throats[257]. A cold infusion of the charred, pulverized stems has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"The stems are very flexible and can be used in basket making[257]. The twigs have been used to make the withes for the three-rod foundation coils of baskets. The branches have been used as the warp in twined baskets and foundation in coiled baskets[257]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The inner bark can be twisted and made into two-ply strings[118, 226, 257]. The bark has been used as a thread in basket making[257]. The wood was formerly used to make charcoal, but is not utilised at the present time[229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. A fast-growing but short-lived tree[229]. Closely related to S. pentandra[200]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy."
