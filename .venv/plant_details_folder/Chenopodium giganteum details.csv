4,Known Hazards,"The leaves and seeds of all members of this genus are more or less edible. However, many of the species in this genus contain saponins, though usually in quantities too small to do any harm. Although toxic, saponins are poorly absorbed by the body and most pass straight through without any problem. They are also broken down to a large extent in the cooking process. Saponins are found in many foods, such as some beans. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]. The plants also contain some oxalic acid, which in large quantities can lock up some of the nutrients in the food. However, even considering this, they are very nutritious vegetables in reasonable quantities. Cooking the plants will reduce their content of oxalic acid. People with a tendency to rheumatism, arthritis, gout, kidney stones or hyperacidity should take especial caution if including this plant in their diet since it can aggravate their condition[238].",

17,Edible Parts,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - cooked[46, 61, 105, 177]. Of excellent quality, they are a spinach substitute[74]. The raw leaves should only be eaten in small quantities, see the notes above on toxicity. Seed - cooked. Ground into a powder and used with wheat or other cereals in making bread etc. The seed is small and fiddly, about 1.5mm in diameter[266], it should be soaked in water overnight and thoroughly rinsed before it is used in order to remove any saponins.",

23,Other Uses Description,Gold/green dyes can be obtained from the whole plant[168]. The stout stems have been used for making walking sticks[266].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in most soils but disliking shade[1, 200]. It prefers a moderately fertile soil[200]. This species is closely related to C. album[50], and was probably derived from it through cultivation[266]. The tree spinach is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves[74], there are some named varieties[183]. 'Magentaspreen' is a vigorous plant growing 1.5 metres tall. It has large leaves, the new growth is a brilliant magenta colour. Tastiest when young, the leaves are eaten raw or cooked like spinach[183]. A warm climate is required in order to ripen the seed[74].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in situ. Most of the seed usually germinates within a few days of sowing.,
