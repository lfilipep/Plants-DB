13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Yellow. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Oval.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Populus tremula is a deciduous Tree growing to 18 m (59ft) by 10 m (32ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower from February to March, and the seeds ripen from May to June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,
19,Edible Uses Description,"- dried, ground into a powder then added to flour and used for making bread etc[2, 115]. A famine food, it is only used when all else fails[177].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Bach: Plants used in the Bach flower remedies.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Bach  Diuretic  Expectorant  Febrifuge  StimulantThe bark and the leaves are mildly diuretic, expectorant and stimulant[9, 165]. The plant is seldom used medicinally, but is sometimes included in propriety medicines for chronic prostate and bladder disorders[9]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, the bark of most, if not all members of the genus contain salicin, a glycoside that probably decomposes into salicylic acid (aspirin) in the body[213, 238]. The bark is therefore anodyne, anti-inflammatory and febrifuge. It is used especially in treating rheumatism and fevers, and also to relieve the pain of menstrual cramps[238]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'Vague fears of unknown origin', 'Anxiety' and 'Apprehension'[209].",
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil conditioner: Plants grown to improve the structure of the soil. See also Green manures.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A very fast growing and wind resistant tree, it can be planted to provide a shelterbelt[11, 24]. Trees can also be planted to improve heavy clay soils in neglected woodlands[200].  - very soft, elastic, easily split, rather woolly in texture, without smell or taste, of low flammability, not durable, very resistant to abrasion. It makes a high quality paper and is also used to make a very good charcoal11, 21, 46, 100, 115].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, it does well in a heavy cold damp soil[1], preferring a neutral to acid soil, and avoiding calcareous soils[11, 24]. The sub-species P. tremula davidiana. (Dode.)Schneid. is tolerant of extremely alkaline soils[200]. The species generally prefers a deep rich well-drained circumneutral soil, growing best in the south and east of Britain[11, 200]. Growth is much less on wet soils, on poor acid soils and on thin dry soils[11]. This species grows well on poor soils, probably because of its intolerance of competition[186]. Plants are very tolerant of exposure[24], doing well in cold exposed sites so long as sufficient moisture is present. Plants dislike shade[186], and are intolerant of root or branch competition[200]. A fast growing tree but it is short-lived[186]. Trees produce suckers freely and can form dense thickets[186]. The aspen is a very good wildlife plant, it has over 90 associated insect species[24] and is a food plant for the green hairstreak butterfly[186]. Poplars have very extensive and aggressive root systems that can invade and damage drainage systems. Especially when grown on clay soils, they should not be planted within 12 metres of buildings since the root system can damage the building's foundations by drying out the soil[11]. Can be planted to improve heavy clay soils in neglected woodlands[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Wetlands plant, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be sown as soon as it is ripe in spring[113]. Poplar seed has an extremely short period of viability and needs to be sown within a few days of ripening[200]. Surface sow or just lightly cover the seed in trays in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the old frame. If sufficient growth is made, it might be possible to plant them out in late summer into their permanent positions, otherwise keep them in the cold frame until the following late spring and then plant them out. Most poplar species hybridize freely with each other, so the seed may not come true unless it is collected from the wild in areas with no other poplar species growing[11]. Cuttings of mature wood in November/December in a sheltered outdoor bed. This species is rather difficult from cuttings[11, 113]. Suckers in early spring[78]. Root cuttings in the winter[200].",
