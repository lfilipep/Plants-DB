24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in a well-drained ordinary good soil[260, K]. Requires a light well-drained neutral to alkaline soil in a sunny position[188, 200]. Plants are tolerant of some shade[238]. Plants are not very cold-hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260]. They generally require greenhouse protection but might succeed outdoors when grown in a very sheltered warm spot in the mildest parts of the country[1]. They can also be grown in containers that are placed outdoors in the summer and then brought into the greenhouse or conservatory for the winter[238]. The plants need to be kept fairly dry in the winter[200]. When grown in pots, the plants require regular repotting in order to stay vigorous[260]. Very tolerant of pruning, they can be cut right down to the base in the autumn when bringing them back indoors, or in the spring to encourage lots of fresh growth[238]. The bruised leaves release a smell of ripe apples[245]. The plant is cultivated for its essential oil[171].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse. Stored seed should be sown in early spring in a greenhouse. The seed germinates best with a minimum temperature of 13°c, germination usually taking place within 2 weeks though it sometimes takes some months[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. If trying them outdoors, plant them out in early summer and consider giving them extra protection during the winter. Cuttings succeed at almost any time in the growing season but early summer is the best time in order for the new plant to become established before winter.",
