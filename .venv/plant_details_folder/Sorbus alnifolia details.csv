3,USDA hardiness,4-7
4,Known Hazards,"The seeds probably contain hydrogen cyanide. This is the ingredient that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. Unless the seed is very bitter it should be perfectly safe in reasonable quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death."
5,Habitats,"Slopes of shady mountain forests of stone pine and deciduous trees on stony and humus rich soils[74]. Slopes, gullies, mixed forests and shrubby thickets at elevations of 500 - 2400 metres[266]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Succeeds in most reasonably good soils in an open sunny position[11]. Dislikes dry soils[188]. Tolerates light shade[188], though it fruits better in a sunny position[K]. Plants are susceptible to fireblight[188].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attractive flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 80]. If you have sufficient seed it can be sown in an outdoor seedbed[78, 80]. Stored seed germinates better if given 2 weeks warm then 14 - 16 weeks cold stratification[98], so sow it as early in the year as possible. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Seedlings are very slow to put on top-growth for their first year or two[11], but they are busy building up a good root system. It is best to keep them in pots in a cold frame for their first winter and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring."
