It has a powerful, incense-like fragrance[245] and is used for making shingles, lathes, fencing, pencils, construction etc[46, 61, 81, 171]. Mature trees are often infected by dry rot, so they are not considered to be a major timber species[229].",,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Succeeds in full sun in a moist well-drained soil that is neutral to acid, though it will also survive on dry alkaline soils[200]. Plants are shade tolerant when young[200]. It grows best in a position that is sheltered from strong winds[245]. Trees are slow growing but long-lived in the wild, with specimens up to 1000 years old recorded[229]. They grow slowly in Britain, but they are perfectly hardy[11]. Young trees can grow 60cm in a year but they seldom average more than 30cm[185]. Growth virtually stops once the tree reaches 25 metres tall[185]. All parts of the plant are strongly aromatic[188, 245]. This species is strongly resistant to honey fungus[81, 188]. The tree exhibits very different crown habits dependant upon the area in which it is being grown[185, 200]. At one time these different habits were considered to be different sub-species, but it is recognised now that it is only climatic forces that cause the differences.

When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors.
