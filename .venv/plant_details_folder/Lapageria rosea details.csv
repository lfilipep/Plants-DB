24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a lime-free humus-rich soil[49, 182, 200]. Requires a cool shady position in a warm moist atmosphere[182]. Succeeds in dry shade according to another report[188]. Requires a deep open-textured soil in a warm position[11, 133, 200] with shade[49, 120]. Requires a well-drained soil[1, 133, 200]. Dislikes cold winds[163]. The Chilean bellflower is best grown on a partially shady and sheltered wall where it will withstand temperatures down to about -5°c[200]. Plants on sunny walls tend to succumb in cold winters whilst those on shady walls are much more likely to survive[120]. Plants can be cut back to the ground in cold winters but will often regrow in the spring[120]. A climbing plant that supports itself by twining around other plants and other supports[219]. It does not really require pruning[219]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is the national flower of Chile[183]. It is not very cold-tolerant, but is commonly cultivated in greenhouses in Britain. It is, however, hardy outdoors in the milder areas of the country[1, 182]. The fruits are only occasionally formed in Britain[219]. When growing this plant from seed, it pays to be very selective and only grow on the strongest seedlings since a weak plant tends to remain weak[1]. Slugs are very fond of the young plants and will soon destroy them if given an opportunity[1]. Plants are also subject to attacks by aphis in the spring[1]. Seedlings require a very free-draining soil and it is best to cover them in a plastic bag for a few days after transplanting[133]. Plants are slow to establish, but are very long-lived[260].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - it is best to sow 2 - 3 seeds per pot as soon as the seed is ripe, in a humus-rich sandy soil in a warm greenhouse[1, 133, 163]. It usually germinates within 6 weeks at 20°c[163]. The flesh of the fruit might contain germination inhibitors and should be completely removed before the seed is sown[163]. The stored seed will require stratification. Pre-soak for 3 days in warm water, changing the water 3 - 5 times a day, then stratify for 1 - 3 months at 4°c[133]. Stored seed germinates within 1 - 3 months at 22°c[133]. Thin the seedlings to the strongest plant in each pot and grow on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse before planting out in early summer. Give the plants some protection for their first winter outdoors. Layering in spring before new growth begins[78] or in autumn[200]. It is best done in individual pots because the roots are very brittle. It takes about 12 months[78]. Leaf bud cuttings[163].",
