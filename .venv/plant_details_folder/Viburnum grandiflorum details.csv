13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Viburnum grandiflorum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft) by 2 m (6ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7.  It is in flower from January to March. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils but is ill-adapted for poor soils and for dry situations[1]. It prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. Requires shelter from north and east winds[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], the deliciously scented flowers are produced in the winter and the flowers are said to withstand temperatures down to -12°c without damage[11, 200]. However fruit is not often produced in this country[K]. This may be due to the plant being self-incompatible and so growing 2 or more different cultivars together may improve fruit set[11, 200]. Hand pollination may also be beneficial as well as siting the plants so that they get the maximum of protection from severe winter weather[K]. A position against an east-facing wall, or on the edge of a woodland, would be ideal for this[K]. Closely allied to V. farreri. The very closely related species V. foetens, which is often included as part of this genus, has a more westerly range, shorter stems and white flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78]."
