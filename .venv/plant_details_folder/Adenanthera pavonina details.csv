21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antiinflammatory  Dysentery  LeprosyThe plant is antibacterial and haemaglutinin[311 ]. A decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of rheumatism and gout[46 , 307 ]. The bark is used to treat leprosy[311 ]. A decoction of the bark and leaves is used to treat dysentery, diarrhoea and tonsillitis[303 ]. The wood is used as a tonic[46 ]. The pulverized wood, mixed with water, is taken orally for treating migraines and headaches[303 ]. In vitro studies suggest Adenanthera pavonina leaf extract has antibacterial activity against the intestinal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Also, high doses of seed extract have an anti-inflammatory effect in studies in rats and mice."

23,Other Uses Description,"Planted as a shade and ornamental tree. Agroforestry Uses: The tree is a natural pioneer. With its fast rate of growth and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, it can be used for land reclamation and to re-establish woodland[ 307 , 418 , K ]. The spreading crown of light, feathery foliage offers attractive shade and the tree is often planted for shade in coffee, clove and rubber plantations[ 303 ]. It is also planted along field borders as part of a windbreak[ 303 , 418 ]. The small leaves break down easily, making the species a good green manure303]. It is compatible with most tropical field and tree crops, making it suitable to use in integrated production systems. It is inter-planted among field and tree crops such as spices, coffee and coconuts[ 303 ]. It is often grown as a shade tree for coffee and nutmeg[ 200 ]. Other Uses The bark is rich in saponins and can be used as a soap for washing clothes etc[ 46 , 200 , 307 ]. Also used as a hair shampoo[ 46 ]. The plant is a source of dyestuffs[ 200 ]. A red dye is obtained from the shredded bark[ 307 ]. The dye has been used for dyeing clothes, and is used by the Hindus of India for the sacred mark placed on the forehead[ 303 , 459 ]. The red, glossy seeds are used as toys and for beads in necklaces and other ornaments[ 46 , 200 , 303 ]. They were formerly used to weigh gold, silver and diamonds, because they have a narrow range in weight[ 303 ]. Goldsmiths use the seeds in soldering[ 46 ]. The heartwood is bright yellow when fresh, turning red upon exposure to the air; it is sharply demarcated from the light grey sapwood, which can be up to 5 cm wide[ 303 ]. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and durable[ 46 , 307 ]. It can be easy or somewhat difficult to work, easy to plane and it takes a high finish[ 303 ]. The heartwood is resistant to dry wood termites[ 303 ]. A valued timber in many countries, being used for cabinet making, construction, flooring, paving blocks, vehicle bodies and fine art[ 307 , 418 ]. Esteemed in the Pacific Islands for fuel wood, the wood burns readily, producing significant heat, and is used in both above- and below-ground ovens[ 303 ]. The wood yields very good charcoal[ 303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop: Integrates annual crops with rows of perennials.,Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Beans Toxic Raw: Beans Toxic when Raw.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Alley crop  Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Beans Toxic Raw  Fodder: Pod  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilA plant of the humid, lowland tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 400 metres[303 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 22 - 28°c, but can tolerate 12 - 36°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 3,000 - 5,000mm, but tolerates 2,000 - 6,000mm[418 ]. Prefers a sunny position, tolerating light shade[418 ]. Succeeds in any moderately fertile, moisture-retentive soil[200 ]. It is found in the wild on a variety of soils, from deep, well-drained to shallow and rocky[418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 7, tolerating 4.5 - 7.5[418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[307 ]. Requires a position sheltered from high winds[303 ]. Plants can become invasive in lowland regions[307 ]. Growth is initially slow but increases rapidly after the first year, during which average annual growth rates of 23 - 26mm in diameter and 200 - 230cm in height can be attained[303 ]. Trees planted 1 x 2 metres apart for windbreaks and at 2 x 2 metres in plantations can be thinned in 3 - 5 years to provide fuel wood and construction materials[303 ]. For shade trees, spacing varies from 5 to 10 metres, depending on the companion crop and site[303 ]. Trees resprout easily, allowing for coppice management with good survival[303 ]. The tree is susceptible to breakage in high winds, with most of the damage occurring in the crown[303 , 418 ]. The seeds are fairly uniform and were traditionally used as weights by apothecaries and goldsmiths - each seed weighing nearly 4grains (0.25g)[307 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - the seedcoat is extremely hard and requires scarification, otherwise germination may take 12 months or more[303 ]. This is easiest to carry out by pre-soaking the seed for 12- 24 hours in warm water[K ]. Treated seed can give 100% germination in as little as 1 - 4 days, though 10 days is more usual[303 ]. The seed can be sown in situ, in nursery beds or in containers[200 , 303 ]. Young seedlings attain a height of 8 - 30 cm in approximately 3 months. Nodal cuttings in sand in a closed case[200 ]. The seed can be stored for several years in sealed containers at room temperature[303 ]. Propagation from large cuttings is reported to be successful in India[303 ]."
