Germination usually takes place in 2 - 3 weeks at 15°c[134].

Division in spring or after flowering[111]. Fairly easy, large divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions whilst it is probably best to pot up smaller divisions and to grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are rooting well.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
