The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. There is a potential confusion over the name of this species. There is a R. hirsutus with a different author (Wirte.) listed in [150] as growing in woods in Britain. Clearly, one of these two species is wrongly named. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn.
