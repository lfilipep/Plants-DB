19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The presence of secondary compounds such as apterin may contribute to the potential medicinal value of Zizia species. Zizia aurea roots have been used by Native Americans as a tea to cure fevers, and the plant has been referred to as a vulnerary (wound-healing) agent [318-1]."
20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. The flowers attract butterflies and seed heads attract birds. Various kinds of insects visit the flowers primarily for nectar, especially small bees (Halictid, Andrenid, Nomadine) and flies (Chloropid, Tachinid, Muscid, Syrphid, etc.), as well as occasional beetles and plant bugs. The bees collect pollen as well, while some flies and beetles may feed on pollen. The caterpillars of Papilio polyxenes asterias (Black Swallowtail butterfly) feed on the foliage of this and other members of the Carrot family [1-6]. Suitable for the wild garden and other informal plantings as well as collections of native wild flowers[200]. Cut Flower. Water Purifier: Used in raingarden plantings [318-1]."
22,Cultivation Details,

Plants tolerate clay loam, rocky or gravelly soil, alkaline pH and controlled burns. Drought Tolerant. Bloom Time: May to July. Bloom Description: Showy, Yellow. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but it is probably best sown in spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
