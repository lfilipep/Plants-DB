22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, it prefers a humus-rich soil[79, 200], succeeding in a moist border or by water[42, 79]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Plants are very cold tolerant, but they can be damaged when dormant if the soil is too moist[79]. A very ornamental plant, there are some named varieties[200]. Plant the bulbs out very shallowly[79]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed should be sown as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first year. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division, best done in August/September after flowering but can also be done in April. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
