0,Equisetum sylvaticum,"Wood Horsetail, Woodland horsetail",Equisetaceae,Coming soon,"Large quantities of the plant can be toxic. This is because it contains the enzyme thiaminase[172], a substance that can rob the body of the vitamin B complex[65]. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]. The plant also contains equisetic acid - see the notes on medicinal uses for more information[213].","Damp woods on acid soils, moors etc[17].","Temperate regions of Europe, including Britain, N.

They are rich in silica, contain several alkaloids (including nicotine) and various minerals[238]. The plant is astringent, diuretic and styptic[4]. The barren stems are used, they are most active when fresh but can also be dried and sometimes the ashes of the pant are used[4].

Plants are hardy to about -30°c[200]. Plants have a deep and penetrating root system and can be invasive. If grown in the garden they are best kept in bounds by planting them in a large container which can be sunk into the ground[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available.
