13,Summary,"Pericopsis angolensis is a deciduous shrub or tree growing about 10-20 m in height. It has a rounded crown and an often curved bole that can be branchless for up to 7.5 m and up to 100 cm in diameter. It is commonly found in tropical Africa. There is no known edible part of this plant but the bark, roots, and leaves are used in traditional medicine for improving blood circulation and treatment of conditions like diarrhea, nausea, eye problems, pain, edema, sore throat, toothache, and headaches. The wood is heavy, highly durable and hard, and resistant to attacks of fungi, termites, and wood borers. It is considered as the most durable native wood in Malawi and used for flooring, panelling, heavy construction, musical instruments, and poles among others. It is also used as fuel and charcoal.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Pericopsis angolensis is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

Also see Astringent.,Aphrodisiac: Increases the sexual appetite.,Odontalgic: Treats toothache (temporary measure only) and other problems of the teeth and gums.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Anthelmintic  Antibilious  Antidiarrhoeal  Aphrodisiac  Odontalgic  Ophthalmic  Stimulant  TonicThe roots, bark and leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine in Africa[299 ]. The roots are abortifacient, aphrodisiac and tonic. A decoctions is used to stimulate the blood circulation, and to treat conditions such as diarrhoea, bronchial and chest complaints, nausea, and eye problems[299 ]. The dried and powdered root is applied externally to relieve pain, and to treat oedema and tumours[299 ]. A decoction or maceration of the bark is taken to treat diarrhoea, sore throat and toothache, and as an eye bath[299 ]. The leaf sap is drunk as an anthelmintic[299 ]. A lef decoction is inhaled as a vapour bath as a treatment for headaches[299 ]. The dried and powdered leaves are applied externally as a treatment for headaches[299 ].",

21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: It has been reported that the occurrence of Pericopsis angolensis trees in Malawi is an indication of fairly fertile soil[299 ]. Other Uses The heartwood is greenish brown, turning dark brown to almost black upon drying; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 25mm wide band of whitish to yellowish grey sapwood. The grain is interlocked; texture moderately fine; the wood is strikingly banded or shows a whorled figure; it is oily to the touch. The wood is heavy, very hard, very durable and resistant to fungi, termites and all wood borers including marine borers. It is also highly resistant to abrasive action and chemicals. It air dries very slowly but with little degrade, except slight surface checking. The rates of shrinkage are low; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood is difficult to saw and work because of its high density; it is rather difficult to plane and a cutting angle of 20% is recommended, but it has a smooth finish; it holds nails and screws well, but pre-boring is necessary; gluing, staining and polishing do not cause problems. The wood turns well; bending properties are moderate. In Malawi, where the wood is considered the most durable native wood, remains of hoes have been found that were at least 90 years old. Traditionally, the extremely durable wood is highly esteemed for making hoes and pestles, and for the rims and hubs of wagon wheels. Commercially, the wood is used for flooring and panelling, and it is also suitable for heavy construction, railway sleepers, mine props, ship building, vehicle bodies, fence poles, vats, interior trim, joinery, furniture, cabinet work, handles, ladders, agricultural implements, sporting goods, musical instruments, toys, novelties, precision equipment, carvings and turnery. In Zimbabwe it is one of the most important trees for poles used in local house construction[299 ]. The wood is used as a fuel - it is difficult to light, but produces great heat and little ash. It also makes excellent charcoal[299 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Trees are sensitive to frost[299 ]. Plants respond well to coppicing, although they often produce a large number of small shoots[299 ]. For firewood production, a coppice rotation of 5 years is possible, but for poles and certainly for larger sizes of timber much longer rotation cycles are needed[299 ]. The trees are fire resistant[299 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ]",
