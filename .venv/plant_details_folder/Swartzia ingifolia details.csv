Unlike other species in the Swartzia genus, this species has no symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Further, this species is not edible and has no medicinal value. The wood is very heavy, very hard, very strong and highly durable. In addition, it is highly resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. Such characteristics made it ideal for high quality woodwork, furniture, cabinet, musical instruments, etc.","Swartzia ingifolia is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate.

The texture is medium; the grain straight or slightly interlocked. The wood is very heavy; very hard; very strong; very elastic; very durable, being very resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking but only a slight risk of distortion; once dry it is poorly to moderately stable in service. It is a very hard wood and has a fairly high blunting effect - stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is poor. A high quality, very strong, durable and attractive timber, its use is limited mainly by the small size of heartwood obtained from the logs. It is used for purposes such as high class furniture, cabinet making, musical instruments of various types, turnery, sculpture, flooring, panelling, wooded goods, items such as arches that require forming; veneer etc[848 ].",,"Although many species within the family Fabaceae have a symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria, this species is said to be devoid of such a relationship and therefore does not fix atmospheric nitrogen[755 ].",Seed -,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
