13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Salix purpurea is a deciduous Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil.",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antiinflammatory  Antiperiodic  Antiseptic  Astringent  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Hypnotic  Sedative  TonicThe bark is anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antiperiodic, antiseptic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic, febrifuge, hypnotic, sedative and tonic[4, 9, 21]. It is a very rich source of salicin, which is used in making aspirin[199]. The bark of this species is used interchangeably with S. alba. It is taken internally in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, gout, inflammatory stages of auto-immune diseases, diarrhoea, dysentery, feverish illnesses, neuralgia and headache[238]. The bark is removed during the summer and dried for later use[238]. The leaves are used internally in the treatment of minor feverish illnesses and colic[238], cancerous sores and chronic dysentery[218]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238]. The twigs are used in the treatment of cancer, dysentery and ulcers[218]. The bark of the stem and roots is anodyne and styptic[218]. It is used in the treatment of rheumatism[218]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Salix / Willow for diseases accompanied by fever, rheumatic ailments, headaches (see [302] for critics of commission E).",
22,Other Uses,"Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The stems are very tough and flexible and are used in basket making[11, 13, 23, 115]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The bark is much disliked by rabbits, so a closely woven fence of this plant can be used as a protective barrier[115]. The bark contains about 10% tannin[223]. Plants can be grown as a hedge[29], the var. 'Gracilis' is suitable for a small hedge on damp sites[182, 200]. It can be kept dense by annual clipping[11]. The plant has an extensive root system and is used in soil reclamation and stabilization projects along estuaries[199]. Dynamic accumulator.",
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Fodder: Bank: Fodder banks are plantings of high-quality fodder species. Their goal is to maintain healthy productive animals. They can be utilized all year, but are designed to bridge the forage scarcity of annual dry seasons. Fodder bank plants are usually trees or shrubs, and often legumes. The relatively deep roots of these woody perennials allow them to reach soil nutrients and moisture not available to grasses and herbaceous plants.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Other Systems: SRC: Short-rotation coppice.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",

Plants prefer an alkaline or neutral soil, rarely doing well in acid conditions[186]. Said to prefer a sandy soil[23, 199], plants are tolerant of dryish soils[11]. Plants are tolerant of salt water[199]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is cultivated for its branches which are used in basket making[11], there are some named varieties[131]. Plants are coppiced annually for this purpose[186] A very important food plant for the caterpillars of many butterfly species[30] and a good bee plant, providing an early source of nectar and pollen[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Plants should be put into their permanent positions as soon as possible[11]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame. Very easy.",
