0,Rhododendron luteum,Honeysuckle Azalea,Ericaceae,4-8,"Although no specific mention of toxicity has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where many members have poisonous leaves. The pollen of many if not all species of rhododendrons is also probably toxic, being said to cause intoxication when eaten in large quantities[183].","Mountain meadows, sometimes on limestone, beech and open coniferous forests, to 2200 metres[184]. Grows from sea-level to the sub-alpine zone[11].",Europe - Austria and Poland to Turkey. Occasionally naturalized in Britain[17].,(0 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RhododendronLuteum.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RhododendronLuteum2.jpg",,Rhododendron luteum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 2.5 m (8ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.,R. flavum.

Commonly used as a rootstock for many of the ornamental cultivars of azaleas[11].",,"Succeeds in a most humus-rich lime-free soils except those of a dry arid nature or those that are heavy or clayey[1]. Prefers a peaty or well-drained sandy loam[1]. Succeeds in sun or shade, the warmer the climate the more shade a plant requires[200]. A pH between 4.5 and 5.5 is ideal[1]. Hardy to about -30°c[184]. A very ornamental plant[1], the flowers are sweetly scented[184] with a honey-like fragrance[245]. Plants self-sow freely when in a suitable position[11]. Succeeds in a woodland though, because of its surface-rooting habit[200], it does not compete well with surface-rooting trees[1]. Plants need to be kept well weeded, they dislike other plants growing over or into their root system, in particular they grow badly with ground cover plants, herbaceous plants and heathers[200]. Plants form a root ball and are very tolerant of being transplanted, even when quite large, so long as the root ball is kept intact[200]. Plants are tolerant of drought when they are grown under trees[184]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn and given artificial light. Alternatively sow the seed in a lightly shaded part of the warm greenhouse in late winter or in a cold greenhouse in April. Surface-sow the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry[200]. Pot up the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a greenhouse for at least the first winter. Layering in late July. Takes 15 - 24 months[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, August in a frame. Difficult[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
