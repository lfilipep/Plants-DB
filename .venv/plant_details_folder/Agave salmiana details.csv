16,Plant Habitats,,
17,Edible Parts,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,
18,Edible Uses,"Manna: this is a sweet substance that exudes naturally from certain plants, usually from the stems.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"ap is fermented to make the alcoholic drink 'pulque'[317 ]. As soon as the inflorescence bud appears (at an age of about 7 years), it is excised. The sweet juice which then exudes for the next 3 - 4 months is collected and fermented[317 ]. Sometimes a brandy is produced by means of distillation of pulque which contains 4 - 8% ethanol. It is also possible to produce sugar or vinegar from the sugar-containing juice[317 ]. The flowering stems are cut into sections and then chewed like sugar cane[301 ]. The cuticle of the young leaves of the central spike is used as a translucent wrapping for the Mexican dish 'mixiote', which is prepared for festive occasions[301 ].",

24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Basic Starch: The Carbon Farming Solution. Eric Toensmeier.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Basic StarchA plant of drier areas in the subtropics and tropics, where it can be found at elevations up to 2,400 metres. Requires a sunny position[423 ]. Requires a well-drained soil[423 ]. Succeeds in poor soils[423 ]. Established plants are very drought resistant[423 ]. A monocarpic species - the plant lives for a number of years without flowering but dies once it does flower. However, it normally produces plenty of suckers during its life and these continue growing, taking about 10 - 15 years in a warm climate, considerably longer in colder ones, before flowering[11 ]. Cultivation is easy in a well-drained sandy soil with sunny exposure. For a pot culture, it requires a container of very large size to remain in an harmonious appearance. It can be used to fix a slope.",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - surface sow in a container in a light position. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 20c[133 ]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots of well-drained soil when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a sunny position until they are at least 20cm tall. It is multiplied more easily by planting shoots than by seedlings.,
