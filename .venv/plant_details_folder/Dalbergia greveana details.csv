19,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  MiscellanyPieces of branches are rubbed on stones with water to produce a paste which is applied to the face as a medicine against various ailments[ 299 ]. Dichloromethane and methanolic extracts of Dalbergia greveana bark showed activity against gram-positive bacteria[ 299 ].,
20,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The heartwood is purplish brown, often with darker stripes; it is distinctly demarcated from the lighter coloured sapwood. The grain is generally straight, texture fine to moderately fine and even. The wood is heavy; very hard; once dry, it is very stable in service; it is durable, being resistant to termite and Lyctus attacks, but only moderately resistant to marine borers. It works well, both with hand tools and machine tools, but it blunts sawteeth rapidly; for nailing and screwing pre-boring is needed; painting and varnishing give moderate results because of the oily surface of the wood; gluing properties are moderate; it is suitable for sliced veneer. A very high quality rosewood, it is much in demand for cabinet making, furniture, marquetry and parquet flooring. It is one of the favoured woods for musical instruments, not only because of its beautiful colour and venation, but also because of its clearness of tone. It is also suitable for interior trim, joinery, ship and boat building, vehicle bodies, poles and piles, precision equipment, carvings, toys and novelties, sporting goods, handles, ladders, turnery, pattern making, veneer and plywood[ 299 ]. The wood is used for fuel[ 299 ].",
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"The tree is believed to grow slowly[ 299 ]. Natural regeneration of this species appears to be poor in comparison to other Dalbergia spp that come from western Madagascar, although in Morondava region the trees were found to be prolific seed bearers with abundant natural regeneration[ 299 ].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",
