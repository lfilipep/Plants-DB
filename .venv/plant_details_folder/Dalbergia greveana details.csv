The grain is generally straight, texture fine to moderately fine and even. The wood is heavy; very hard; once dry, it is very stable in service; it is durable, being resistant to termite and Lyctus attacks, but only moderately resistant to marine borers. It works well, both with hand tools and machine tools, but it blunts sawteeth rapidly; for nailing and screwing pre-boring is needed; painting and varnishing give moderate results because of the oily surface of the wood; gluing properties are moderate; it is suitable for sliced veneer.

Natural regeneration of this species appears to be poor in comparison to other Dalbergia spp that come from western Madagascar, although in Morondava region the trees were found to be prolific seed bearers with abundant natural regeneration[ 299 ].","Like many species within the family Fabaceae, once they have been dried for storage the seeds of this species may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
