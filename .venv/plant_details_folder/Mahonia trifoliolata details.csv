Slopes and flats in grassland, shrubland, and sometimes open woodland at elevations of 0 - 2000 metres[270].","South-western N. America - Texas, Arizona, Mexico.",(3 of 5),(4 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaTrifoliolata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaTrifoliolata2.jpg",,"Mahonia trifoliolata is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2 m (6ft 7in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7 and is not frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Berberis ilicifolia. B. roemeriana. B. trifoliata. B. trifoliolata.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Hedge;,Fruit: ,Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 3, 85]. An acid flavour but nice, especially when added to porridges or muesli[K]. A subtle tart flavour, it is pleasant to eat raw[183]. Unfortunately there is relatively little flesh and a lot of seeds[K]. The fruit is also used to make preserves[149, 183]. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute[149].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Dysentery  TonicBerberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[181, 213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Ink: Plants that can be used as an ink.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.","A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark of the stem and roots[46, 61, 149, 181]. It is green according to another report[168]. An ink is made from the wood[46, 61]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. Makes a good hedge[149]. The wood is a source of tannin[46].",,"Unlike most members of the genus, this species requires a dry, perfectly drained position in full sun, a gritty slightly acid soil is best[200]. It does well in a hot, dry position[167]. Succeeds in a good garden soil[11]. The form in general cultivation in Britain (M. trifoliolata glauca. I.M.Johnst.) comes from the southern part of its range[67], it is only hardy on a sunny wall in this country or as a free-standing shrub in the very mildest areas[3, 11]. The young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. A good bee plant[149]. Resistant to honey fungus[88].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their next winter. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
