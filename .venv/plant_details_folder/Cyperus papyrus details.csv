Rhizomes and lowermost parts of the stems - raw or cooked[269 ]. They can also be chewed, sucked, and spat out, much as sugar cane is done[269 ].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Papyrus had a number of medicinal applications in the past, though it is little, if at all, used nowadays[269 ]. The pith was recommended for widening and drying of fistula[269 ]. The main use seems to have been confined to burnt papyrus sheets, the ash of which was reputed to have the action of pulverised charcoal and was used in the treatment of certain eye diseases[269 ]. The ash was also said to check malignant ulcers from spreading in the mouth or elsewhere[269 ]. It was also said that, if macerated in vinegar and then burnt, the ash would heal wounds[269 ].",,"The fibrous pith of the stems has been utilized for making paper[302 ]. For making paper, the fibrous covering is stripped off the stem and the inner pith is split into wafer-like strips. These strips are then laid side by side, with others placed crosswise on top; the strips are dampened then pressed so that their glue-like sap cements them together. They are then dried into a sheet[269 ].. The plant was also traditionally used to make formal bouquets funeral garlands, boats, cordage, fans, sandals, matting, corkage, boxes, and paper[269 ]. Papyrus stems can be used for caulking seams in wooden ships[269 ]. Papyrus mats are used for making fences and huts[269 ]. The rhizomes are cut into sections and used as beads[520 ].","Historic Crop: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.","Historic Crop  Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Regional CropA plant of the subtropics to the tropics. It can tolerate a mean annual precipitation in the range 100 - 4,200mm, and a mean annual temperatures of 20 - 30?c[269 ]. Succeeds in full sun and in partial shade[200 , 302 , 352 ]. Prefers a fertile, wet soil, or shallow water up to 30cm deep[200 , 302 ]. The plant can tolerate a pH in the range 6.0 - 8.5[269 ]. Plants can spread rapidly by means of their rhizomes[302 ]. Many African swamps are dominated by papyrus thickets, which totally block navigation. It is estimated that the swamp areas of the White Nile, and the 'Papyrus Swamps' around Lake Kioga and Victoria are responsible for the loss of 50% of that river's water through evaporation and plant transpiration[269 ]. Plants can flower throughout the year[269 ].",Seed - Division.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
