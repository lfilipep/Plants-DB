Researchers have reported that Tramadol (an opioid pain medication) was found in relatively high concentrations (1%+) in the roots of the Nauclea latifolia. This is now reported to be the result of Tramadol being administered to cattle by farmers. Radiocarbon analysis has confirmed that tramadol could not be plant-derived and was of synthetic origin (wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol)."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Plants grow in hot tropical climates, where they are found at elevations from sea level to around 200 metres[303 , 335 ]. They grow best in areas where the mean annual temperature is around 27°c[303 ]. They succeed in a range of moisture conditions from fairly dry savannah to moist forest[335 ], preferring a mean annual rainfall around 2,700mm[303 ]. Plants are tolerant of a range of soils, preferring a position in full sun[307 ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[307 ]. Seedlings commence fruiting when about 5 - 6 years old[335 ]. The flowers are extremely fragrant[307 ]. Plants respond well to coppicing[303 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - usually sown in situ[303 ]. The seed is said to germinate more quickly and reliably if it first passes through the gut of a baboon[303 , 307 ]. Cuttings of greenwood. Layering."
