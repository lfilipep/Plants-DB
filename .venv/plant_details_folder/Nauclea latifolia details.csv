It has small branches that are thick and drooping. The bark is dark gray, fibrous, and cracked. The leaves are shiny green, oval, and rounded at the base but pointed at the tip. The flowers are white-yellow and occur in a single rounded heads. It can be cooked and consumed as vegetable. The fruit is a compound fruit, red or pinkish, and round consisting of very small seeds. Its pulp is deep red, watery, and has a sweet flavor. African Peach is used against various medical conditions such as diabetes, fever, indigestion, and cough. It can also be used as windbreak and/or planted for soil conservation. Leaves can be used as mulch and small twigs as chewing sticks. Roots yield yellow dye. Wood is termite-resistant and used for inlay work and fuel. Nauclea latifolia Sm. is now known to be a synonym of Sarcocephalus latifolius (Sm.)

It is used in the treatment of fevers, indigestion[46 ]. The fruit is eaten as a cure for coughs[303 ]. The alkaloid strictosamine is obtained from the roots, leaves and stem bark[303 ]. Researchers have reported that Tramadol (an opioid pain medication) was found in relatively high concentrations (1%+) in the roots of the Nauclea latifolia. This is now reported to be the result of Tramadol being administered to cattle by farmers. Radiocarbon analysis has confirmed that tramadol could not be plant-derived and was of synthetic origin (wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramadol).","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Mulch: Used for covering the ground to conserve the nutrients in the soil.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Agroforestry Uses: A suitable species for planting schemes for conservation and soil stabilization[303 ].
