24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a light lime-free soil in sun or semi-shade[11, 200]. If planted out when young into a planting hole that has been filled with a light lime-free soil the plants will successfully grow into the surrounding soil[11]. Prefers a warm sheltered position with protection from the morning sun[11]. Dislikes wet soils. Established plants are drought tolerant, they grow better in Britain when the summer is dry. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain. Dormant plants tolerate temperatures down to about -5°c[200] but the young growth is liable to be damaged by late frosts[11]. Succeeds in the milder parts of the country[1]. Plants were growing and fruiting well on a west-facing wall at Kew in 1992[K]. Plants do not flower freely unless in a warm sunny spot or on a south facing wall[182]. The flowers are very fragrant[219]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[11]. Stored seed requires 3 months warm then 3 months cold stratification[113]. Germination is usually good, prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle. Overwinter in a greenhouse for the first winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[113]. Layering in autumn."
