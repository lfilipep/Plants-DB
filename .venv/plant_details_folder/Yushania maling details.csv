See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Arundinaria maling. Fargesia maling.

When growing vigorously, the canes can be used for weaving baskets or making fencing, more usually though the growth is smaller and is used for making brushes and straws[220].",,"Prefers an open loam of fair quality[200] and a position sheltered from cold drying winds[11]. Succeeds on peaty soils. Requires abundant moisture and plenty of organic matter in the soil[1, 11]. Grows well in light woodland[122]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to about -5°c and is probably best grown under protection[200]. A plant is growing well at Trebah gardens in Cornwall, where it was 5 metres tall with new canes 30mm in diameter in 195[K]. The rhizome is running and can be invasive[11, 122]. It is fairly easy to control, however, because the new shoots are brittle and easily broken off of the plant. New shoots are produced from late May. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until the seedlings are large enough to plant out, which could take a few years. Seed is rarely available. Division in late spring[25]. Best done as the new shoots first appear above ground[25]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].
