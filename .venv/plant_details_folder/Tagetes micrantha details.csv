Secretions from the roots of growing plants have an insecticidal effect on the soil, effective against nematodes and to some extent against keeled slugs. These secretions are produced about 3 - 4 months after sowing[200]. These root secretions also have a herbicidal effect, inhibiting the growth of certain plants growing nearby. It has been found effective against perennial weeds such as Ranunculus ficaria (Celandine), Aegopodium podagraria Ground elder), Glechoma hederacea (Ground ivy), Agropyron repens (Couch grass) and Convolvulus arvensis (Field bindweed)[200, 238].

Dried plants can be hung indoors as an insect repellent[238]. Dynamic accumulator.",,"Requires a well-drained moderately fertile soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants are not very resistant to frosts and need to be grown as half hardy annuals. Removing dead flowers before the seed is formed will extend the flowering season[188].
