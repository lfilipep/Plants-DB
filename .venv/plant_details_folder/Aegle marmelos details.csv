Marmelosin derived from the pulp is given as a laxative and diuretic[ 303 ]. In large doses, it lowers the rate of respiration, depresses heart action and causes sleepiness[ 303 ]. For medicinal use, the young fruits, while still tender, are commonly sliced horizontally and sun-dried and sold in local markets[ 303 ]. They are much exported to Malaysia and Europe. Because of the astringency, especially of the wild fruits, the unripe bael is most prized as a means of halting diarrhoea and dysentery, which are prevalent in India in the summer months[ 303 ]. The leaves are astringent and are used in the treatment of peptic ulcers[ 254 ]. The dried root is used in the treatment of earache[ 254 ].

It is fine-grained, hard, but not durable; takes a fine polish. Generally available in smaller dimensions, it is often utilized for carving and making small objects such as small-scale turnery, tool and knife handles, pestles and combs. When larger sizes are available it has been used for carts and construction, though it is inclined to warp and crack during curing[ 303 , 307 , 404 ]. The wood can be used for fuel[ 404 ].",,"The plant is a hardy, deciduous tree that can be grown in tropical and sub-tropic areas, being tolerant of harsh conditions, including extremes of temperature[ 306 ].

In Thailand, it only flowers and fruits well where there is a prominent dry season[ 306 ]. Does best on rich, well-drained soils[ 303 ], but can tolerate poor soils and alkaline conditions[ 306 ]. It also grows well in swampy, alkaline or stony soils having pH range from 5 to 8[ 303 ]. It has gained the reputation of thriving where other fruit trees cannot survive[ 303 ]. Plants are very drought tolerant[ 303 ]. Seedling trees begin to crop when 6 - 7 years old, vegetatively propagated plants bear fruit after 5 years and full bearing can be attained in about 15 years[ 306 ]. A tree may yield as many as 800 fruits in a season but an average crop is 150 to 200, or, in the better cultivars, up to 400[ 303 ]. The fruit ripens in the dry season when most leaves have been shed in anticipation of bloom for the next crop[ 306 ]. The plant responds well to coppicing[ 404 ].","Seed - the plant is commonly grown from seed in nurseries and transplanted into the field[ 303 ].
