The roots are delicate and liable to rot, most water being absorbed through the foliage[200]. The plant has an aromatic resinous smell[4]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]. Although looking more like a moss, this genus is closely related to the ferns[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Spores - best sown as soon as they are ripe on the surface of a humus-rich sterilized soil. Keep the compost moist, preferably by putting a plastic bag over the pot. Pot on small clumps of plantlets as soon as they are large enough to handle and keep humid until they are well established. Do not plant outside until the ferns are at least 2 years old and then only in a very well sheltered position. The spores are generally produced in abundance but are difficult to grow successfully[200]. Layering of growing tips[200]."
