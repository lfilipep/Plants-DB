23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Pest tolerant, Specimen. Best grown in a warm sheltered site on a deep fertile soil with a pH between 5 and 6 and an annual rainfall of around 1000mm[200]. Plants dislike dry winds and soils that dry out readily[200]. Slow-growing[11]. A difficult tree to grow well in cool temperate regions, if planted out when small it is easily scorched and can be killed by temperatures of -5°c[200]. In Britain good trees are only found in the southern part of the country[200]. Plants prefer a continental climate with hot summers - they are then much hardier and tolerate cold winters[200]. Best planted out when 30 - 80cm tall, it needs to be kept weed free until established and might require winter protection for its first few years[200]. There are several named forms, selected for their ornamental value[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow late winter in a cold greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
