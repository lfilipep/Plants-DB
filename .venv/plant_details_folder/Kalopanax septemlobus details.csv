A polymorphic species[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed probably requires a period of cold stratification and should be sown as soon as possible. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Root cuttings in late winter."
