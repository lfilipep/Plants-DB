24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Prick out the plants into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle, grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring after the last expected frosts."
