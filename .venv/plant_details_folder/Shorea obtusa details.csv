The flowers are yellow that droop in clusters. The plant yields a very hard timber, which is used for construction purposes, with high commercial value. The trunk also yields resin for local and medicinal uses. In particular, it is used in the treatment of wounds, ulcers, dysentery, etc. The resin is also used for caulking boats and baskets, and in making traditional torches.","Shorea obtusa is a deciduous Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",This name is unresolved.,,,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.",,"Antibiotic: An agent that inhibits or destroys a living organism. It usually refers to bacteria or other micro-organisms and is probably synonymous with Antibacterial,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibiotic  Dysentery  MalariaA resin obtained from the tree is antibiotic. It is used in the treatment of wounds, ulcers etc[404 , 730 ]. It is also recommended as a cure for dysentery[404 ]. The bark is used to treat malaria[404 ].","Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Waterproofing: Does what it says. See also Pitch and Oil.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Other Uses: The bark has a high tannin content[404 ]. A yellowish resin exudes from the bark. It is used for caulking baskets and boats and to make a traditional torch[404 , 730 ]. The heartwood is brown, turning to dark brown or dark reddish brown, often with fine dark lines; the narrow band of sapwood is pale yellow to pale brownish-white. Texture is medium, the grain interlocked and lustre is dull. The wood is heavy, very hard and durable, especially in the open and in contact with water. Sawing is reported to be rather difficult, mostly due to the high resin content; the wood works quite smooth; it is slightly susceptible to surface cracking and end splitting. However, untreated sleepers have lasted for 15 years[404 ]. The wood is used for construction works, bridges, piles, ship-building, framing of boats, utility and garden furniture, interior uses such as parquet flooring, heavy-duty flooring, window- and door frames. It is also very valuable for railway sleepers[404 ].",,"A plant of tropical monsoon climates, where it grows at an elevation up to 1,000 metres. It grows best in areas with a mean annual precipitation of 1,250 - 2,000mm, with a well pronounced wet season and a dry season of up to 6 months. However, it can also grow with less than 1,250mm[404 ]. Requires a sunny position[404 ]. It grows well on well-drained sandy soils, rocky soils, lateritic soils, including ferric acrisols, gleyic acrisols, and ferralic cambisols. Unlike the majority of dipterocarps, it can survive even on very poor soils and rocky areas[404 ]. An acid to neutral pH is suitable[404 ]. In Cambodia it is often found on gray soil on shale[404 ]. The plant is adapted to growing in areas where fires are common in the dry season[404 ].","Seed. The viability of freshly collected seeds is low and after screening out those attacked by insects and clipping the wings, they are sown right away into shaded nursery beds. Survival percentage has been reported to be 65 - 75%[404 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
