13,Summary,"Found in tropical lowland forests of central and east Africa, Uganda Ironwood or Muhimbi (Cynometra alexandri) is a legume that reaches up to 50 m in height. It is characterized by a wide, flat-topped crown and straight, cylindrical bole that can be branchless for up to 26 m. The bole is usually 20-150 cm in diameter with extensive thin buttresses near the base. It is highly valued for its timber. The heartwood is resistant to termite damage and is used in heavy-duty flooring, construction, marine work and railway sleepers. It is also used for fuel and charcoal-making.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Cynometra alexandri is an evergreen Tree growing to 30 m (98ft) by 30 m (98ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

See also Green manures.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
21,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used for soil conservation[ 364 ]. Other Uses: The tree is harvested from the wild for its wood which is used locally and also traded. Known in the trade as 'Ugandan Ironwood', it is a heavy timber of some importance[610]. It is sometimes planted as an amenity tree to provide shade[364]. The heartwood is a dull reddish-brown with darker markings; it is clearly defined from the greyish sapwood, which turns pale yellow upon exposure. The texture is fine; the grain is usually interlocked; without lustre; sometimes figured. The wood is very heavy and hard, being very resistant to abrasion; the heartwood is rated as durable and highly resistant to termite attack. It dries slowly, with a tendency to surface and end checking, but with little warp. It is fairly difficult to work with hand and machine tools; has a rather severe blunting effect on cutters; turns very well; has moderate steam-bending properties. It is used for purposes such as industrial and heavy-duty flooring, heavy construction including marine work, railroad crossties, mining props, posts etc[ 316 , 364 , 610 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[ 364 ]. Due to its physical properties, such as bending strength, inter-node distance, and leaf surface area, the Muhimbi is favoured by chimpanzees for their daily construction of sleeping platforms or 'nests'.",
