17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,"Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"rk - raw or cooked[257]. Mucilaginous[105, 161, 213]. Best harvested in the spring[257]. The inner bark can be eaten fresh, but is more often dried, ground into a powder and either used as a thickener in soups or is mixed with flour for making bread etc[K]. Seed - raw or cooked[63, 64, 105, 226, 257]. Rich in oil, the seed has a slightly resinous flavour. Quite small, it is only about 8mm long[200]. The seed can be crushed into a meal and used in making bread etc[213]. The resin has been chewed as a gum[226, 257]. Young male cones have been chewed for the juice[257]. A vanillin flavouring is obtained as a by-product of other resins that are released from the pulpwood[200].",

21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Diuretic  Febrifuge  Ophthalmic  Pectoral  Poultice  Rubefacient  Salve  Skin  Vermifuge  VulneraryPonderosa pine was employed medicinally by several native North American Indian tribes, who valued it especially for its antiseptic and vulnerary properties, using it to treat a range of skin problems, cuts, wounds, burns etc[257]. It was also valued for its beneficial effect upon the respiratory system and was used to treat various chest and lung complaints[257]. The turpentine obtained from the resin of all pine trees is antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient and vermifuge[4]. It is a valuable remedy used internally in the treatment of kidney and bladder complaints and is used both internally and as a rub and steam bath in the treatment of rheumatic affections[4]. It is also very beneficial to the respiratory system and so is useful in treating diseases of the mucous membranes and respiratory complaints such as coughs, colds, influenza and TB[4]. Externally it is a very beneficial treatment for a variety of skin complaints, wounds, sores, burns, boils etc and is used in the form of liniment plasters, poultices, herbal steam baths and inhalers[4]. The branches are used in herbal steam baths as a treatment for muscular pains[257]. A decoction of the plant tops has been used in the treatment of internal bleeding and high fevers[257]. An infusion of the dried buds has been used as an eye wash[257].",

Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Cosmetic: Used to improve the physical appearence of a person.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Herbicide: Plants or plant extracts that can inhibit the growth of other plants.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles[168]. A yellow dye can be made from the pollen[226]. A blue dye can be made from the roots[257]. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat[201]. The branches are used as a strewing herb[99]. A decoction of the plant tops has been used as a conditioning wash to give a person a fair and smooth skin[257]. A fairly wind-tolerant tree, it can be used in shelterbelt plantings[200]. This tree is a source of resin, though it is not exploited commercially[64, 171]. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile[64]. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood[4, 64]. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields[64]. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin[64] and is separated by distillation[4, 64]. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc[4]. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc[4]. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative, adhesive etc[257]. It burns well and so has been used to make torches[257]. The root fibres have been used in making baskets[257]. Material for insulation and a tinder are also obtained from the tree[99]. The cones make a quick fire, whilst the scales from the trunk bark burn easily, give off no smoke and cool quickly[213].  - light, strong, fine-grained and pleasantly aromatic, the wood can vary from soft to hard[1, 46, 82, 171, 226, 229]. An important lumber tree, it is used for making furniture, boxes, toys etc[1, 46, 82, 171, 226, 229], and it is also used for fuel[99]. For reasons that are unclear, some tree stumps contain high concentrations of pitch - this makes them very rot-resistant and inflammable and therefore useful for fence posts and kindling[226].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Timber: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: Standard  Regional TimberThrives in a light well-drained sandy or gravelly loam[1, 11]. Dislikes poorly drained moorland soils[1]. Established plants tolerate drought[200]. Seedlings strongly dislike growing in the shade[60] and are unable to succeed under the canopy of the parent trees[226]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[200]. Extensively used in cool temperate forestry[200], this species is occasionally planted for timber in central and southern Europe[50]. Growth can be quite fast when young but it soon drops of and averages around 30cm per year[185]. The best trees in Britain are found in a belt running from Kent through the Midlands to N. Wales and also in S. Scotland[185]. Trees live 300 - 600 years in the wild[229], they seem to be long-lived and healthy in Britain[185]. Seed production commences when the tree is about 20 years old[229]. There are usually several years of low to medium yields between each year of high yields[229]. The cones are 8 - 15cm long, they open and shed their seed whilst still attached to the tree and then soon fall from the tree[82, 226]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. Leaf secretions inhibit the germination of seeds, thereby reducing the amount of plants that can grow under the trees[18]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed[80]. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two[11]. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow[K]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm[200]. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well[K]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Cuttings. This method only works when taken from very young trees less than 10 years old. Use single leaf fascicles with the base of the short shoot. Disbudding the shoots some weeks before taking the cuttings can help. Cuttings are normally slow to grow away[81].",
