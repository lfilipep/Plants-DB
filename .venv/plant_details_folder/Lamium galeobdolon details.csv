22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"A good ground cover plant, spreading rapidly by means of its rooting stems and succeeding even in dense shade. It is very vigorous, however, and can smother small plants[31, 197, 200]. It does very well in woodlands[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Ground cover, Massing, Woodland garden. A very easily grown plant, it tolerates most soils and conditions[200]. It grows well in heavy clay soils[17], though it prefers a light calcareous soil[1]. Dislikes dry soils[31]. This species succeeds even in dense shade, growing well under trees[31, 200]. Once established, it can also succeed in drought conditions under the shade of trees, providing there is plenty of humus in the soil[190]. There are at least four sub-species, L. galeobdolon montanum is the form generally found wild in Britain and it is a triploid. L. galeobdolon luteum and L. galeobdolon flavidum are both diploids[187]. L. galeobdolon argentatum is the more rampant form, its clone 'Variegatum' is a commonly used ground cover plant for shady places[187]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A very invasive plant, sending out long prostrate shoots that root at intervals along the stems[31, 200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - usually self sows freely and should not require human intervention. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. The seed can also be sown in situ as soon as it is ripe. Division in spring. Succeeds at almost any time in the growing season. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
