Camphor is used medicinally, in perfumes, as an insecticide and also to make celluloid and as a wood preservative[171]. It can also be put in shoes to cure perspiring feet[178] (probably by acting as a deodorant rather than preventing perspiration[K]).

Camphor is grown commercially in China and Japan as a medicinal tree and also for its essential oil[46]. It is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain[11, 166], though it can survive occasional lows down to about -10°c when fully dormant[57]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. There are various large trees that are growing well in Cornwall[59]. A very slow growing tree[4]. The roots are very sensitive to disturbance[164]. There are some named varieties, selected for their ornamental value[200]. Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Attracts butterflies, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - the seed has a short viability and is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse[200]. Remove the fruit pulp since this can inhibit germination[200]. Germination can take 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in a warm greenhouse[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for at least their first two winters outdoors.
