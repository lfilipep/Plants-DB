The leaves are normally used fresh but can also be dried for winter use[21]. A very pleasant addition to salads[K], the leaves have a delightful scent of cloves[4]. Use the leaves sparingly in cooking because the heat concentrates the flavour[244]. A refreshing tea is made from the leaves[21]. The seed can be eaten on its own or added to bread dough as a flavouring[183]. When soaked in water it becomes mucilaginous and can be made into a refreshing beverage called 'sherbet tokhum' in the Mediterranean[183].

It acts principally on the digestive and nervous systems, easing flatulence, stomach cramps, colic and indigestion[254]. The leaves and flowering tops are antispasmodic, aromatic, carminative, digestive, galactogogue, stomachic and tonic[7, 14, 21, 178, 218]. They are taken internally in the treatment of feverish illnesses (especially colds and influenza), poor digestion, nausea, abdominal cramps, gastro-enteritis, migraine, insomnia, depression and exhaustion[238]. Externally, they are used to treat acne, loss of smell, insect stings, snake bites and skin infections[238]. The leaves can be harvested throughout the growing season and are used fresh or dried[238]. The mucilaginous seed is given in infusion in the treatment of gonorrhoea, dysentery and chronic diarrhoea[240]. It is said to remove film and opacity from the eyes[218]. The root is used in the treatment of bowel complaints in children[240]. Extracts from the plant are bactericidal and are also effective against internal parasites[218, 238]. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Its keyword is 'Clearing'[210]. In Chinese medicine for kidney disease and gum ulcers [301].

An average yield of 1.5% essential oil is obtained from the flowering tops[7]. When applied to the skin it makes a good mosquito repellent[7]. The growing or dried plant is an effective insect repellent. It is a good plant to grow in the home, where it repels flies, or in the greenhouse where it can keep all manner of insect pests away from nearby plants[14, 20, K]. It has been used in the past as a strewing herb[201]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Specimen. Prefers a rich light well-drained to dry soil[1, 27, 238]. Requires a sunny sheltered position if grown outdoors[52]. Tolerates a pH in the range 5 to 8[238]. Sweet basil is commonly grown as an aromatic culinary and medicinal herb in warm temperate and tropical climates. There are a number of different constituents that make up the essential oil in basil, and the proportions of these vary considerably between plants growing in different regions of the world[238]. From this variety many named varieties with differing flavour characteristics have been developed[46, 238]. Basil is a perennial plant in the tropics, but it is frost tender and needs to be grown as a half-hardy annual in temperate zones[142]. It is a very good companion plant to grow in the house or greenhouse, its aromatic foliage helping to reduce problems caused by insect pests[K]. It requires a good hot summer in Britain if it is to do well outdoors[K]. Sweet basil is a good companion plant for tomatoes but it grows badly with rue and sage[14, 18, 20, 201]. When grown near raspberries it can retard their fruiting[201].  Special Features:Attractive foliage, Edible, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, Suitable for dried flowers, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow mid to late spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination is usually free and quick, prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If growing basil outdoors, plant out after the last expected frosts."
