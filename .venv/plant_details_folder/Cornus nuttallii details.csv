18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"The fruit is possibly edible[177]. The fruit is about 10mm in diameter[200] and has a thin, mealy flesh[82].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiperiodic: Counteracts recurring illnesses such as malaria.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiperiodic  Febrifuge  Laxative  Malaria  TonicThe bark is antiperiodic, cathartic, febrifuge, laxative and tonic[46, 61, 118, 257]. An infusion is used as a quinine substitute in the treatment of malaria[46, 118, 226]. The infusion has also been used in the treatment of stomach complaints[257]. Externally, it is used to treat ulcers[257].",

23,Other Uses Description,"An intense brown dye is obtained by boiling the bark[257]. The bark is rich in tannin and has been used as a preservative[257]. The long slender branches have been used in making baby baskets[257].  - exceedingly hard, heavy, strong, close grained. It is used for tool handles, cabinet making etc[46, 61, 82, 118].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Specimen, Woodland garden. An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Another report says that it does not thrive in poor chalky soils[182]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184], but they require long hot humid summers in order to promote good growth[200]. A very ornamental tree[1], but it is usually short-lived in Britain and does not do well in the north of this country[11]. There is some evidence to suggest that trees grow better on poor soils and can be killed by too much kindness. A very good tree has been seen on a poor gravel soil[182]. Closely related to C. florida[226]. This species is the floral emblem of British Columbia[226]. A number of named varieties have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Blooms are very showy.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of about 3 days warm stratification at 15°c before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",
