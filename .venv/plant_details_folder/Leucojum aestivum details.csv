24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Massing, Rock garden, Specimen, Woodland garden. Easily grown in ordinary garden soil[1]. It does well in a moist heavy soil in full sun or partial shade[1, 17, 31, 90] and is happy in water-logged conditions[90]. The dormant bulbs are fairly hardy and will withstand soil temperatures down to at least -5°c[214]. Plants can be naturalized in damp rough grass[200]. Flowers are produced within 4 - 5 years from seed. The seedpods are swollen and filled with air so that they can be dispersed by floating in water[90]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Naturalizing, Suitable for cut flowers."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a well-drained soil in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification, it should then germinate in 2 - 4 weeks at 10°c[134]. Sow the seed thinly so that the seedlings can be allowed to grow on undisturbed in the pots for their first year of growth. Give them an occasional weak liquid feed to ensure that they do not become nutrient deficient. Pot up the small bulbs when dormant, planting 2 - 3 bulbs in each pot. Grow them on for another 2 - 3 years before planting them out. Division of offsets in September/October. It is best done as soon as the foliage ripens[1]. Scooping the bulbs."
