24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy outdoors in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. There is some confusion over the correct name for this species, it could possibly be Psoralea lanata or Dalea lanata. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
