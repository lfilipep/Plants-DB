19,Edible Uses Description,"tissues of the bark, stems and wood are used to extract the white or brownish sap which has been shown to contain 2.73% caffeine. The native people in adjacent Colombia regularly used this product as a stimulating breakfast beverage[434 , 521 ]. The stem is cut into pieces 30 - 100cm long, and the epidermis, cortex, and phloem are rasped. The scrapings thus obtained are squeezed to express the caffein-bearing sap into cold water (hot or warm water is never used with yoco), the rasped tissues being then discarded. The liquid, of a cloudy milky-white or light chocolate-brown colour, is drunk cold. The beverage, which is taken early every morning, allays hunger and supplies muscular stimulation[476 ]. Lianas of Paullinia Yoco, which have a stout stem at least 8cm in diameter at the base, are utilized. Usually several trees must be felled before the liana falls to the ground. Starting at the root, the stem is then cut into pieces which may vary from 30 - 100cm in length. These pieces are stored in cool corners of Indian houses and can retain their stimulating properties for a month or even longer[928 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibilious: Corrects the secretions of bile.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.",
