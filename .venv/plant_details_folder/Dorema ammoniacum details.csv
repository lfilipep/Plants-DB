A gum resin is found in cavities in the tissues of stems, roots and petioles[4]. It often exudes naturally from holes in the stems caused by beetles[238] though this is not so pure as that obtained from the plant tissues[4]. The resin is antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, expectorant, poultice, stimulant and vasodilator[4, 46, 64, 165, 238]. It is often used internally in the treatment of chronic bronchitis (especially in the elderly), asthma and catarrh[4, 238]. Externally, it is used as a plaster for swellings of the joints and indolent tumours[4, 238]. The resin exudes as a milky gum from holes made in the stems. This gum is pressed into blocks and then ground into a powder[254].","Porcelain: ,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,","A medicinal gum or resin called 'Ammoniacum' is exuded from insect damaged stems[46, 61, 64, 174].

It is said to produce viable seed in this country[238].",Seed - sow in an outdoor seedbed in April[175]. It might be better to sow the seed in the autumn in a cold frame or greenhouse[K]. The seed germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 15°c[175]. If seed is in short supply we would recommend sowing it in a pot in a cold frame and pricking out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
