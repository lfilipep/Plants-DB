Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Poultice  Stimulant  VasodilatorAmmoniacum has been used in Western herbal medicine for thousands of years and is still seen as an effective remedy for various complaints of the chest[254]. A gum resin is found in cavities in the tissues of stems, roots and petioles[4]. It often exudes naturally from holes in the stems caused by beetles[238] though this is not so pure as that obtained from the plant tissues[4]. The resin is antispasmodic, carminative, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, expectorant, poultice, stimulant and vasodilator[4, 46, 64, 165, 238]. It is often used internally in the treatment of chronic bronchitis (especially in the elderly), asthma and catarrh[4, 238]. Externally, it is used as a plaster for swellings of the joints and indolent tumours[4, 238]. The resin exudes as a milky gum from holes made in the stems. This gum is pressed into blocks and then ground into a powder[254]."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in an ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a well-drained to dry soil in a sunny position[238]. This species is not hardy in all parts of Britain, it tolerates temperatures down to at least -5°c[238]. A monocarpic species, growing for a number of years before it flowers but then dying after flowering[238]. It is said to produce viable seed in this country[238]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in an outdoor seedbed in April[175]. It might be better to sow the seed in the autumn in a cold frame or greenhouse[K]. The seed germinates in 2 - 6 weeks at 15°c[175]. If seed is in short supply we would recommend sowing it in a pot in a cold frame and pricking out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year.
