0,Tamus communis,Black Bryony,Dioscoreaceae,4-8,"The whole plant is poisonous due to its saponin content[7]. Although toxic, saponins are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm. They are also broken down by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]. The toxic effect of this plant is not caused by saponins, but by calcium oxalate crystals which are found mainly in the fruit[65].","Hedgerows, scrub, woodland edges and copses, avoiding acid soils[1, 9].","Europe, south and east from Britain and Belgium to N.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower from May to July, and the seeds ripen from September to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees, flies. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.

Use with caution, the plant is rich in saponins, has a very powerful cathartic affect and ranks as a dangerous irritant poison[4, 7]. It is not normally used internally, but the macerated root is applied externally as a poultice to bruises, rheumatic joints etc[4, 7]. This should not be done without expert advice since it can cause painful blisters[9]. The root is used fresh[9] or can be harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[7].",,None known,,"Requires a moist well-drained fertile soil[17]. A climbing plant, the weak stems support themselves by twining around other plants and are capable of growing quite high up into shrubs and trees[4]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow in a cold frame in early spring or as soon as the seed is ripe in the autumn.
