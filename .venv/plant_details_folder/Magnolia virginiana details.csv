It is hardy to UK zone 5 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Beetles.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade.

17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Condiment: the various plants that are used as flavourings, either as herbs, spices or condiments.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,eaThe leaves are used as a condiment in gravies etc[183]. A tea is made from the leaves[183].
20,Medicinal Uses,"Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Hallucinogenic: Causes the mind to hallucinate.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Aromatic  Astringent  Bitter  Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  Hallucinogenic  Malaria  StimulantA tea made from the bark is antiperiodic, aromatic, diaphoretic, laxative, stimulant and tonic[4, 222]. It has historically been used as a substitute for quinine in the treatment of malaria[222, 238] and is also taken internally in the treatment of colds, bronchial diseases, upper respiratory tract infections, rheumatism and gout[238, 257]. The bark has been chewed by people trying to break the tobacco habit[222]. The bark is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use[238]. It does not store well so stocks should be renewed annually[238]. A tea made from the fruit is a tonic, used in the treatment of general debility and was formerly esteemed in the treatment of stomach ailments[222]. The leaves or bark have been placed in cupped hands over the nose and inhaled as a mild hallucinogen[257]."

23,Other Uses Description,"An essential oil from the flowers has been used in the manufacture of perfumes[227].  - straight-grained, light, soft, easily worked, finishes well, aromatic and yellow in colour[4, 46, 61, 229]. It weighs 31lb per cubic foot[227]. Used for furniture, broom handles, bowls and light woodenware articles etc[46, 61, 227, 229]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny sheltered position in a deep soil that does not dry out in the summer[11]. Plants are also tolerant of wet soils[238]. Succeeds in acid or neutral soils in sun or part shade[184]. Dislikes limey soils[11]. Tolerates some alkalinity so long as there is at least 50cm of good soil above the alkaline layer[202]. The branches are brittle so a sheltered position is required[200]. Plants are very tolerant of atmospheric pollution[200]. Mature dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c but the flowers are easily damaged by frost or wind.[184]. A warmth-loving species, it is best grown in the south and east of Britain[11]. The fleshy roots are easily damaged and any transplanting is best done during a spell of mild moist weather in late spring[182]. A slow growing tree but it flowers whilst young[182]. The flowers have a delicious scent of lemons[182]. A number of cultivars have been developed for their ornamental value. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 9 through 6. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. An evergreen. The root pattern is a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [1-2]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed must be kept cold over the winter and should be sown in late winter in a cold frame[200]. The seed usually germinates in the spring but it can take 18 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse for at least their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions when they are more than 15cm tall, though should be well mulched and given some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Layering in early spring[200]."
