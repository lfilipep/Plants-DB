24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good deep medium to stiff loam[1]. Requires a sheltered position in semi-shade and a lime-free soil[138]. Although cold hardy in Britain, this species really requires a warm continental climate if it is to prosper and it does not do well in the maritime climate of this country[200]. It succeeds in the London area but does not attain its full size there[11]. It grows well in S.W. England[11]. The catkins have an unpleasant hawthorn-like smell to attract midges for their pollination[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[138]. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out. It can be stored for a few months if kept cool and moist (putting it in a plastic bag that is placed in the salad compartment of a fridge works well). Stored seed should be soaked in warm water for 24 - 48 hours prior to sowing[138]. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick out the seedlings into individual pots and plant them out in mid summer if possible, otherwise grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring. Give the young plants some protection from cold for their first few winters outdoors.",
