The fruit is used iby the Chinese as a substitute for Cornus officinalis[266]. These uses are as follows:- Shan Zhu Yu has been used for at least 2,000 years in Chinese herbal medicine. It is a herb that ""stabilizes and binds"" and is used principally to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and unusually active secretions including copious sweating, excessive urine, spermatorrhoea and premature ejaculation[147, 238, 254]. Like all herbs that suppress bodily fluids (even excessive ones), it will simply prolong or lead to a worsening of symptoms if it is used without tonic or detoxifying herbs[254]. It is, therefore, normally used in combination with herbs such as Rehmannia glutinosa and is an ingredient of the ""Pill of eight ingredients"" which is used in China to ""warm up and invigorate the yang of the loins""[254]. The fruit is antibacterial, antifungal, hypotensive, antitumor, astringent, diuretic, hepatic and tonic[116, 147, 176, 178, 238]. The fruit, without the seed, is decocted for the treatment of arthritis, fever and a wide range of other ailments[218, 279]. It is used in the treatment of senile lumbago, diabetes, cystitis, tinnitus etc[174, 254, 279]. The fruit has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Bacillus dysenteriae and Staphylococcus[176]. The fruit is harvested when fully ripe and is dried for later use[238].","Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",An oil obtained from the fruit is used for industrial purposes[266]. The bark contains essential oils and tannins[266].,,"An easily grown plant, it succeeds in any soil of good or moderate fertility[1], ranging from acid to shallow chalk[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeds in full sun or light shade[[188]. Prefers semi-shade[219]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -5°c[200], Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or in an outdoors seedbed if there is sufficient seed[80, 113]. The seed must be separated from the fruit flesh since this contains germination inhibitors[80, 164]. Stored seed should be cold stratified for 3 - 4 months and sown as early as possible in the year[164]. Scarification may also help as may a period of about 3 days warm stratification at 15°c before the cold stratification[80, 164]. Germination, especially of stored seed, can be very slow, taking 18 months or more[164]. Prick out the seedlings of cold-frame sown seeds into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse, planting out in the spring after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe side shoots, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, taken with a heel if possible, autumn in a cold frame. High percentage[78]. Layering of new growth in June/July. Takes 9 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
