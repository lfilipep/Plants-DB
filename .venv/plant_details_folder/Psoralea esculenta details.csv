See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from May to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",Pediomelum esculentum.

The dried root can be ground into a powder and used with cereals in making cakes, porridges etc[183]. Starchy and glutinous, the raw root is said to have a sweetish turnip-like taste[183]. The plant is best harvested as the tops die down at the end of the growing season[85]. This food is a staple and also considered to be a luxury item by many native North American Indian tribes[2, 61]. The root contains about 70% starch, 9% protein and 5% sugars[95].","Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Requires a well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants are very intolerant of root disturbance, they are best planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small[200]. This plant has been recommended for improvement through breeding and selection for its edible root[183]. It was sent to Europe around the year 1800 as a potential food crop but was not well received[213]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is tuberous with swollen potato-like roots  [1-2].",Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early to mid spring in a greenhouse. Either sow the seed in individual pots or pot up the young seedlings as soon as possible in order to avoid root disturbance. Grow them on in the pots until planting out in their final positions. It is usually impossible to transplant this species without fatal damage to the root[200]. Division in spring. With great care since the plant resents root disturbance. It is virtually impossible to divide this species successfully[200].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
