0,Rosa laevigata,Cherokee Rose,Rosaceae,6-9,There is a layer of hairs around the seeds just beneath the flesh of the fruit. These hairs can cause irritation to the mouth and digestive tract if ingested.,"Rocky places at low altitudes[109]. In open fields, farmland, or in scrub at elevations of 200 - 1600 metres[266].",E. Asia - Southern China from Sichuan and Hubei to Taiwan.,(2 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RosaLaevigata.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RosaLaevigata2.jpg",,"Rosa laevigata is an evergreen Shrub growing to 6 m (19ft 8in) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from August to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge;,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[177]. The pear-shaped fruit is up to 4cm long[200], but there is only a thin layer of flesh surrounding the many seeds[K]. Sugar can be extracted from the fruit, it is also used to ferment rose wine[266]. Some care has to be taken when eating this fruit, see the notes above on known hazards. The seed is a good source of vitamin E, it can be ground and mixed with flour or added to other foods as a supplement[102, 183]. Be sure to remove the seed hairs[102].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Anticholesterolemic: Prevents the build up of cholesterol.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow. In early stages of pregnancy it can induce an abortion.,Infertility: Used in treating problems of human fertility.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Anticholesterolemic  Astringent  Cancer  Carminative  Depurative  Diuretic  Dysentery  Emmenagogue  Infertility  Kidney  Stomachic  Urinary  VulneraryThe leaves are a famous vulnerary[218]. The fruits, root and leaves are emmenagogue and depurative[147]. Their use stabilizes the kidneys[147]. A decoction is used in the treatment of chronic dysentery, urinary tract infections, wet dreams, prolapse of the uterus, menstrual irregularities and traumatic injuries[147]. The root bark is astringent and used in the treatment of diarrhoea and menorrhagia[218]. The dried fruits are antibacterial, anticholesterolemic, astringent, carminative, diuretic and stomachic[176, 178, 218, 238]. They are used internally in the treatment of urinary dysfunction, infertility, seminal emissions, urorrhoea, leucorrhoea and chronic diarrhoea[238]. The root is used in the treatment of uteral prolapse[218]. The flowers are used in the treatment of dysentery and to restore hair cover[218]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214].","Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.",The root bark contains tannin[266]..,,"Succeeds in most soils[11], preferring a circumneutral soil and a sunny position[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes water-logged soils[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], but it is not very hardy in Britain and only succeeds outside in the warmer parts of the country[11]. It can be cut back to the ground even in southern England in cold winters, though it will usually resprout from the base[260]. It is the state flower of Georgia[219] and is also the parent of several modern garden cultivars[219]. The flowers have a clove-like fragrance[245]. If any pruning is necessary then this should be carried out immediately after the plant has finished flowering[219]. Grows well with alliums, parsley, mignonette and lupins[18, 20]. Garlic planted nearby can help protect the plant from disease and insect predation[18, 20]. Grows badly with boxwood[18]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[80]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].","Seed. Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat[80]. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate[80]. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested[80]. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°c[200]. It may take 2 years to germinate[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July in a shaded frame. Overwinter the plants in the frame and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth. Select pencil thick shoots in early autumn that are about 20 - 25cm long and plant them in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[78, 200]. The cuttings can take 12 months to establish but a high percentage of them normally succeed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Layering. Takes 12 months[11].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
