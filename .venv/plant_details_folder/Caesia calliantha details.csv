Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in this country. It tolerates temperatures down to -7°c in Australian gardens but, because of our cooler summers and longer, colder and wetter winters this cannot be directly translated to British gardens. This plant is widespread in Australia so it is possible that some provenances will succeed here. Plants are likely to require a well-drained soil in a sunny position and some sort of protection in the winter. This species is considered to be no more than a variety of C. parviflora by some botanists[193].","Seed - we have no details on this species but suggest that it can be sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse. Stored seed should be sown in the spring in a warm greenhouse. Sow the seed thinly and grow the plants on in the seed pot for their first year, giving liquid feeds if necessary. Pot the plants up into individual pots in early spring and grow them on in the greenhouse for a second year before planting them out in early summer.
