Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Foundation, Screen. Prefers an open free-draining humus-rich loamy soil with its roots in the shade and its head in the sun[200]. Prefers a limey soil[200]. Succeeds in acid and limey soils according to one report[90], whilst another says that it does not tolerate acid soil conditions[245]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is very easily grown and is one of the most virus-tolerant of lilies[90]. It is also a fast-growing plant, onion-sized flowering bulbs can be obtained in 2 years from seed[K]. The flowers have a pleasant sweet perfume[245]. Early to mid autumn is the best time to plant out the bulbs in cool temperate areas, in warmer areas they can be planted out as late as late autumn[200]. The plant should be protected against rabbits and slugs in early spring. If the shoot tip is eaten out the bulb will not grow in that year and will lose vigour[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Suitable for cut flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - immediate epigeal germination[130]. Sow thinly in pots from late winter to early spring in a cold frame. Should germinate in 2 - 4 weeks[163]. Great care should be taken in pricking out the young seedlings, many people prefer to leave them in the seed pot until they die down at the end of their second years growth. This necessitates sowing the seed thinly and using a reasonably fertile sowing medium. The plants will also require regular feeding when in growth. Divide the young bulbs when they are dormant, putting 2 - 3 in each pot, and grow them on for at least another year before planting them out into their permanent positions when the plants are dormant[K]. Division with care in the autumn once the leaves have died down. Replant immediately[200]. Bulb scales can be removed from the bulbs in early autumn. If they are kept in a warm dark place in a bag of moist peat, they will produce bulblets. These bulblets can be potted up and grown on in the greenhouse until they are large enough to plant out[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
