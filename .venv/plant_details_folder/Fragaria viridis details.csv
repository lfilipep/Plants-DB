13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Fragaria viridis is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.3 m (1ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen from June to July. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"An excellent ground cover plant, spreading vigorously by means of surface stolons and forming a dense carpet[K]. It grows well amongst shrubs but can out-compete smaller plants[K]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile, well-drained, moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[200]. Tolerates semi-shade though fruit production will be reduced when plants grow in such a position. This species is closely related to F. vesca[200]. Plants are sometimes dioecious. In this case, male and female plants will be needed if fruit and seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 4 weeks or more to germinate. The seedlings are very small and slow-growing at first, but then grow rapidly. Prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out during the summer. Division of runners, preferably done in July/August in order to allow the plants to become established for the following years crop[200]. They can also be moved in the following spring if required, though should not then be allowed to fruit in their first year. The runners can be planted out direct into their permanent positions."
