24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it can be grown outdoors in Britain. The species type, Girardinia diversifolia ssp diversifolia, is a perennial plant, but the ssp G. diversifolia suborbiculata is an annual[266]. Since the plant can be grown as an annual there is a good chance of success in temperate climates especially if the plants are started early in a greenhouse[K]. Plants can be dioecious or monoecious, though the annual form is generally monoecious[266].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in May. If you have sufficient seed it might be worthwhile trying a sowing outdoors in situ in the middle of spring. Division of roots[272].",
