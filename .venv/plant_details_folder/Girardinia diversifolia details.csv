The species type, Girardinia diversifolia ssp diversifolia, is a perennial plant, but the ssp G. diversifolia suborbiculata is an annual[266]. Since the plant can be grown as an annual there is a good chance of success in temperate climates especially if the plants are started early in a greenhouse[K]. Plants can be dioecious or monoecious, though the annual form is generally monoecious[266].","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in May.
