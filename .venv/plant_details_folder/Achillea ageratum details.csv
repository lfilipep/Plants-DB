24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils but prefers a well-drained soil in a sunny position[1, 200]. It also succeeds in partial shade[187]. Plants live longer in a poor soil[200]. Established plants are very drought tolerant, they can show distress in very severe droughts but usually recover[190]. Plants succeed in maritime gardens[233]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. An excellent plant to grow in a large pot, the long stems will tend to arch down and continue to flower for a long time[244]. The leaves have a pungent aroma, especially when the plant is grown in a hot sunny position[245]. The plant is intermediate between A. millefolium and A. ptarmica in its characteristics[233]. There is at least one named variety, selected for its ornamental value[233]. Hybridizes freely with other members of the genus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring or early autumn in a cold frame[133]. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months[133]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. If this species is a hybrid it might not breed true from seed. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, the divisions can be planted direct into their permanent positions. Basal cuttings of new shoots in spring. Very easy, collect the shoots when they are about 10cm tall, potting them up individually in pots and keeping them in a warm but lightly shaded position. They should root within 3 weeks and will be ready to plant out in the summer."
