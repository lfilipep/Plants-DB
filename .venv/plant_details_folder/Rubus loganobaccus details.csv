0,Rubus loganobaccus,Loganberry,Rosaceae,7-10,None known,Not known in a truly wild situation.,Probably a hybrid between R. ursinus and the raspberry 'Red Antwerp'. Rarely naturalized in Britain.,(5 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Frost Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/RubusLoganobaccus.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/noplantimage2.JPG",,"Rubus loganobaccus is a deciduous Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft) by 2.5 m (8ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Apomictic (reproduce by seeds formed without sexual fusion). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",R. ursinus loganobaccus.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[1, 3, 34, 61, 171]. A pleasant acid flavour, it usually crops heavily[K]. The fruit is up to 4cm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,A purple to dull blue dye is obtained from the fruit[168].,,"Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[1, 11, 200]. Tolerates all but the most alkaline soils[202]. Plants dislike exposed windy situations[K]. Hardy to about -18°c[202]. Often cultivated for its edible fruit in temperate countries, there are some named varieties[61], including forms with thornless stems[200]. 'LY654' is a thornless form with good flavour[200]. This species has fast-growing biennial stems[202], it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. The plant produces apomictic flowers, these produce fruit and viable seed without fertilization, each seedling is a genetic copy of the parent[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Closely related to R. ursinus[200]. Plants are liable to attacks of raspberry cane spot and mildew, otherwise they are one of the most reliable of the fruiting members of this genus[202].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
