Seeds are large, up to 2cm long.","Annona liebmanniana is an evergreen Tree growing to 20 m (65ft) by 20 m (65ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10 and is frost tender.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil. The plant is not wind tolerant.",Annona scleroderma Saff. Annona testudinea Saff.,,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw. Delicious and aromatic, it is best eaten fresh from the plant[ 46 , 301 ]. A richer flavour than the soursop (A. muricata) with a suggestion of the flavour of the white sapote (Casimiroa edulis)[ 301 ]. A creamy banana-pineapple like flavour, it is said to be one of the most flavourful and refreshing fruits in the genus[ 377 ]. The fruit has an agreeable flavour, it is 8 - 10cm in diameter, but the seeds are very large, up to 2cm long[ 331 ].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None Known,,"A plant of the moister, lowland tropics, usually growing near sea level but also found at elevations up to 1,800 metres[ 331 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23° - 26°c, but can tolerate 8° - 32°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 3,500 - 4,500mm, but tolerates 3,000 - 5,000mm[ 418 ]. Young trees seem to grow better in shade, but older trees grow well in sunny positions[ 418 ]. Prefers a moist, well-drained, sandy loam with a pH of around 6[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7[ 418 ]. The tree may suffer from wind damage on exposed sites[ 418 ]. Trees can commence fruiting in just 4 years from seed, by which time they are 4 - 6 metres tall[ 377 , 418 ]. Trees flower on the previous year's growth[ 377 ]. The fruit of this species has a thick exocarp, making it suitable for long-distant transport[ 317 ]. This gives it potential in breeding programmes with other members of the genus to develop fruits with thick skins suitable for shipping[ 46 ].","Seed - usually breeds true to type[ 200 ]. Sow in individual pots, not deeper than 2cm, at 21c[ 200 ]. The seed of many species in this genus has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ].
