A creamy banana-pineapple like flavour, it is said to be one of the most flavourful and refreshing fruits in the genus[ 377 ].

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the moister, lowland tropics, usually growing near sea level but also found at elevations up to 1,800 metres[ 331 ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23° - 26°c, but can tolerate 8° - 32°c[ 418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 3,500 - 4,500mm, but tolerates 3,000 - 5,000mm[ 418 ]. Young trees seem to grow better in shade, but older trees grow well in sunny positions[ 418 ]. Prefers a moist, well-drained, sandy loam with a pH of around 6[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, tolerating 4.5 - 7[ 418 ]. The tree may suffer from wind damage on exposed sites[ 418 ]. Trees can commence fruiting in just 4 years from seed, by which time they are 4 - 6 metres tall[ 377 , 418 ]. Trees flower on the previous year's growth[ 377 ]. The fruit of this species has a thick exocarp, making it suitable for long-distant transport[ 317 ]. This gives it potential in breeding programmes with other members of the genus to develop fruits with thick skins suitable for shipping[ 46 ]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - usually breeds true to type[ 200 ]. Sow in individual pots, not deeper than 2cm, at 21c[ 200 ]. The seed of many species in this genus has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing in order to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing[ K ]. Semi-ripe cuttings[ 200 ]."
