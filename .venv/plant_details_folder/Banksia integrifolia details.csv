17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,Nectar: produced in such abundance by some flowers that it can be harvested fairly easily.,
19,Edible Uses Description,owers are rich in nectar and this is sometimes harvested as a food. It is best harvested in the morning before birds and evaporation deplete the yields[193]. The flowers can be sucked or soaked in water in order to obtain the nectar[193].,
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The bark contains about 10% tannin[46, 154]. Used as a rootstock for other members of this genus[200].  - soft, easily worked, pinkish with a prominent grain. It is highly decorative but the plants tend to be gnarled and irregular thus limiting its use. Used for veneers, furniture etc[154, 167].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[157]. Requires a lime-free soil[1]. Thrives in acid sandy loams[167]. Prefers a pH between 6.3 and 6.5[200]. If this species is to be successfully cultivated, the soil should be low in nutrients, especially in nitrates and phosphates[200]. Quite resistant to wind and salt spray, it grows well by the coast[166, 200]. Plants growing in exposed positions have entire leaves whilst those in sheltered positions have serrated leaves[154]. Plants require greenhouse protection in most parts of Britain[1] but they succeed outdoors on a sheltered wall in the mildest areas of the country[166]. Plants in Australian gardens tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. A polymorphic species, there are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. A good bee plant[154, 167].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in an ericaceous compost as soon as the seed is ripe or as soon as it is obtained and do not exclude light. Seal the pot in a plastic bag until germination takes place, which can take 1 - 3 months or more at 20°c[134]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in sand in a frame[200].",
