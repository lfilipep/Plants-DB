They are sialagogue[178, 218]. The flowers are used in the treatment of thirst and depression whilst the essential oil is used to treat colds[266]. The leaves and roots can be used in the treatment of contusions, cuts, haemorrhages, strains, lumbago, rheumatism, numbness and colds[266].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The flowers are very fragrant, they are used in pot-pourri and to make perfumes[1, 46, 61]. The wood, after soaking in water, polishes to a brilliant black finish[178].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Espalier, Foundation, Massing. Requires a good soil in a sunny sheltered position[164, 200]. Badly drained or compacted soils may cause blotching or yellowing of the leaves[200]. Succeeds in most soils but it seems most at home on chalky ones[219]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -25°c[184]. It is best grown on a sunny wall, however, in order to protect the flowers and induce heavier flowering[11]. The flowers are very fragrant[182], but the plant can be very sparse flowering after cool summers[184]. Plants have a moderate rate of growth[202]. Plants take 5 - 12 years to flower from seed[182, 200]. The var. 'Grandiflorus' comes true from seed and has larger flowers than the type[78]. Plants flower profusely when established and left unpruned[219], if any pruning is necessary then it is best done immediately after flowering[184, 219]. The flowers are produced on the leaf axils of wood 3 - 4 years old[202]. The flowers emit a powerful sweet fragrance which can be smelt 50 yards away. The smell is like jonquil and violets[245]. When the fragrance is inhaled close to for any length of time the smell seems to disappear[245]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78, 200]. Pre-soak stored seed in tepid water for two hours, keep warm and moist for 3 days then chill for 5 - 8 weeks and sow in a cold frame[164]. Germination is usually good, though it is often slow and erratic, and takes place in 2 months or more at 13°c[78, 164]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Extremely difficult to root[11]. Layering in spring[200] or in July/August[78]. Takes 9 months[78]. Fair to good percentage[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
