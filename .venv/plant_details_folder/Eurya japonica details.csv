24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moderately fertile free-draining moisture retentive soil in sun or part shade with shelter from cold drying winds[200]. Probably best grown in a well-drained lime-free humus-rich soil[182]. Plants grow much taller in the milder areas of Britain[182]. Protect plants from frost when they are young[200]. The dwarf form that is grown in Britain is quite hardy once it is established[11]. The flowers are malodorous[200]. The trees are pollarded in the Himalayas and the leaves used for leaf manure[146]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame or sow in early spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 6 - 8cm with a slight heel, July/August in individual pots in a frame. High percentage[78]."
