25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Pest tolerant, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a moisture retentive well-drained deep rich loam in full sun[11, 200]. Prefers a neutral to alkaline soil[238]. Succeeds in shallow chalky soils[245]. Grows best in areas with long hot summers[200]. Plants are gross feeders and require a rich soil if they are to perform well[11]. Dormant plants are fully hardy in Britain[188], but the young growth is liable to damage from late spring frosts[11, 188, 200]. The leaves are aromatic[188]. This species is occasionally cultivated for timber in S.E. Europe[50]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. Stored seed requires 2 months cold stratification, sow in late winter in a cold frame[78, 113]. Germination is usually good. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in autumn and over winter in a cold frame. Fair to good percentage[78]. Root cuttings - obtain in December and store in leafmold in a warm place for 3 weeks. Cut into 4cm lengths and plant horizontally in pots. Grow on in a warm greenhouse. Good percentage[78].",
