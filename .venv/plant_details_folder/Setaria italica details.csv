The plant was derived through cultivation and its origin is obscure.,(4 of 5),(2 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SetariaItalica.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SetariaItalica2.jpg",,"Setaria italica is a ANNUAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in) by 0.1 m (0ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Panicum italicum. Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv. var. metzgeri.,Cultivated Beds;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Seed - cooked[2, 34, 46]. It can be eaten as sweet or savoury food in all the ways that rice is used, or ground into a flour and made into porridge, cakes, puddings etc[105, 183, 418]. It is considered a nutritious food and is often recommended for the elderly and for pregnant women[299]. The seed can also be sprouted before it is used, when it will become somewhat sweeter[K]. Most cultivars are non-glutinous and are thus suitable for the diet of people with coeliac disease[299]. A nutritional analysis is available[218].","Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emollient: Softens the skin, causing warmth and moisture.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Appetizer  Astringent  Cholera  Digestive  Diuretic  Emollient  Refrigerant  StomachicThe germinated seed of yellow-seeded cultivars is astringent, digestive, emollient and stomachic[176, 178, 218]. It is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, poor digestion and food stagnancy in the abdomen[176]. White seeds are refrigerant and used in the treatment of cholera and fever[218]. Green seeds are diuretic and strengthening to virility[218].","Bedding: Used as a lining for sleeping on or putting fruits etc on.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Thatching: Used for making thatched roofs.",Agroforestry Uses:The plant can be sown in contour strips for erosion control[299].Other Uses:The straw is used for thatching and bedding in places such as India[299].The bran contains up to 9% oil and can be used for oil extraction[299].,,"A plant of the temperate and subtropical zones, amenable to cultivation in the tropics where it is found at elevations up to 2,000 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 16 - 26°c, but can tolerate 5 - 35°c[418]. It is intolerant of frost[375]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 500 - 700mm, but tolerates 300 - 4,000mm[418].Grows best in a sunny position[162, 299]. Succeeds in any well-drained soil from light sands to heavy clays, preferring fertile conditions[162, 299]. Established plants have a deep root system and are very drought resistant[57, 61, 375]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 6.8, tolerating 5.5 - 8.3[418].Plants can mature a crop in 60 - 120 days from sowing the seed, depending on conditions and variety[418].Seed yields of 800 - 900 kilos per hectare can be attained from rain-fed crops; this has been increased to 1,800 kilos in China with selected forms and a rainfall of fewer 900mms[299, 375]. Experimental yields of 11 tonnes per hectare have been obtained with irrigation[299].There are many named varieties[46, 183]. Because the plant flowers in late summer there are problems with harvesting a good crop of seed in Britain and similar temperate climates. Apart from that, the plant grows well here.","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination is usually quick and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on fast. Plant them out in late spring, after the last expected frosts. Whilst this is fine for small quantities, it would be an extremely labour intensive method if larger amounts were to be grown. The seed can be sown in situ in the middle of spring though it is then later in coming into flower and may not ripen its seed in a cool summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
