America - Chile.,(0 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/HebeSalicifolia.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/HebeSalicifolia2.gif",,"Hebe salicifolia is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4.5 m (14ft) by 3 m (9ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from June to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",Veronica salicifolia.,Hedge;,None known,"Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  DysenteryTreats dysentery, having an antiperistaltic action[153].","Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.","A very wind resistant shrub, it can be grown as a shelter hedge in exposed maritime positions. Attractive flowers.",,"Succeeds in most soils so long as they are not boggy or too dry[182]. Prefers a light well-drained soil[1, 166] and a sunny position[200]. Prefers a moist rich soil[166] but plants are probably hardier in a soil that is on the poor side[1]. Lime tolerant[11]. Intolerant of drought[166]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. Very wind resistant, withstanding maritime exposure[166]. A polymorphic species[200[, it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a clumping habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1].","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on the young plants for at least their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring or early summer after the last expected frosts. It would probably be worthwhile giving some protection to the plant for its first winter outdoors. Cuttings of half ripe wood, 3 - 5cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up when roots are forming and keep in a frame or greenhouse for its first winter before planting out in late spring. Cuttings of mature wood, late autumn or winter in a frame.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
