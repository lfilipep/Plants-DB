See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from June to July, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",M. dauricum.,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,"Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The whole plant is used to alleviate skin allergies and is also used in the treatment of cancer[218].,,None known,,"Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil that does not dry out excessively in summer, in sun or partial shade[200]. Prefers full sun[219]. This species is hardy to about -30°c, but, due to a lack of summer heat, the plants usually produce soft growth in mild maritime areas and this can be cut to the ground at temperatures around -5 to -10°c[200]. The plants do not require pruning, but can benefit from being cut back to ground level every 2 - 3 years in order to keep them tidy[219]. Closely related to M. canadense, differing mainly in its annual or rarely persistent aerial stems[200]. A twining plant, it spreads freely by means of underground suckers[11, 182]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - sow late winter in a greenhouse[78, 113]. Two months cold stratification speeds up germination[113] so it might be better to sow the seed as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[K]. Germination is usually good[78]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of mature wood, autumn in a frame[200]. Division of suckers in early spring[78, 113]. The suckers can be planted out direct into their permanent positions, though we prefer to pot them up and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are established[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
