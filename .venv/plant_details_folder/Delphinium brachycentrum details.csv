Keep moist and in a shady position until germination takes place[175]. The seed has a limited viability so it should be stored in a sealed container at about 3°c[200]. Temperatures above 15°c inhibit germination[175]. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 9 weeks at 15°c[175]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Cuttings of basal shoots in April/May, taken before they become hollow at the base, and planted in a cold frame[111].
