22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"A low growing herbaceous perennial with starry golden daisy-like flowers native to the USA. Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, acidic, organically rich soils in sun-dappled part shade. Tolerates full sun only if grown in consistently moist soils. Spreads by rhizomes to form an attractive ground cover, but is easily controlled[368-1]. Growth Rate: Moderate to Fast. Stand Persistence: Long. Form: Spreading. Texture: Medium. Sun: Full Sun, Partial Shade. Soil Type: Sandy, Loamy, Silty, Clay. Soil Moisture: Moderate. Root Type: Stolon, Fibrous Shallow. Bacteria-Fungal Ratio: 10:1-100:1. Seasonal Interest: Spring-Fall. In the US it grows more upright in northern climates and more prostrate in southern climates. Recommended to naturalize in rain gardens. Best in well-drained soils. Blooms sparsely during the heat of summer. Fruit Type: Achene. Flower Color: Yellow. Soil pH preference: 6.0 - 6.8. Drought: Moderate. Flood: Tolerant. Salt: Intolerant. Soil Compaction: Intolerant. Cold Injury: Moderate. Wind Storm Damage: Infrequent. Disease Issues: Minor. Insect/Pest Damage: Minor. Animal Damage: Deer, Rabbits. Growing Season: Bloom Time: Spring - Fall. Fruit Time: Spring - Fall [318-1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. An evergreen.  The root pattern is rhizomatous with underground stems sending roots and shoots along their length  [1-2]. Used in the Beach Plum Tree Guild: (Polycultures: Permaculture Activist Magazine February 2013, Eric Toensmeier.) Beach Plum (Prunus maritima) This fruiting shrub can grow to over 12 feet (4 meters) and produces small, delicious plums. Niche: deciduous shrub. Habitat: average water needs, Full to partial sun, Prefered soil types UNKNOWN (assume loamy soil is good?). Notable Products: Edible fruit, Green and Gold (Chrysogonum virginianum) This is a beautiful groundcover that attracts beneficial insects and can grown in partial shade and moist soils. Niche: Ground cover. Habitat: Requires consistently moist soil that drain, Full sun to partial shade, Notable Products: Nectar. Dwarf Coreopsis (Coreopsis auriculata nana) This is another beautiful groundcover that attracts beneficial insects. Niche: Herbaceous perennial. Habitat: Full sun, medium water needs, said to be native to open woods in South Eastern US, so it probably can survive in a variety of soil types. Notable Products: Nectar, pollen. Ramps (Allium tricoccum) a.k.a. Wild Leeks, are early Spring vegetables and grows well in the shade. Niche: Herbaceous perennial. Habitat: Shaded woodlands, average water needs, preferes wet and acid soils. Tolerats juglone. Notable Products: Edible leaves and bulbs. Camas (Camassia quamash) has edible bulbs and has flowers that attract beneficial insects. Niche: Small Herbaceous Plant. Habitat: Full sun to light shade, prefers moist soil, pH: 5.1-7.5 (tolerates a wide range of soil conditions). Notable Products:Nectar, pollen, edible bulb. Notes: This is a polyculture with flowering plum and ground cover, edible Spring vegetables, and edible Camas bulbs.",
