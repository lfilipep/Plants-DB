Notable Products: Edible fruit, Green and Gold (Chrysogonum virginianum) This is a beautiful groundcover that attracts beneficial insects and can grown in partial shade and moist soils. Niche: Ground cover. Habitat: Requires consistently moist soil that drain, Full sun to partial shade, Notable Products: Nectar. Dwarf Coreopsis (Coreopsis auriculata nana) This is another beautiful groundcover that attracts beneficial insects. Niche: Herbaceous perennial. Habitat: Full sun, medium water needs, said to be native to open woods in South Eastern US, so it probably can survive in a variety of soil types. Notable Products: Nectar, pollen. Ramps (Allium tricoccum) a.k.a. Wild Leeks, are early Spring vegetables and grows well in the shade. Niche: Herbaceous perennial. Habitat: Shaded woodlands, average water needs, preferes wet and acid soils. Tolerats juglone. Notable Products: Edible leaves and bulbs. Camas (Camassia quamash) has edible bulbs and has flowers that attract beneficial insects. Niche: Small Herbaceous Plant. Habitat: Full sun to light shade, prefers moist soil, pH: 5.1-7.5 (tolerates a wide range of soil conditions). Notable Products:Nectar, pollen, edible bulb.
