16,Plant Habitats,
17,Edible Parts,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.
19,Edible Uses Description,"Seed - cooked[301]. A delicious flavour[301]. The seed can be dried and ground into a powder then used with wheat flour etc when making bread and cakes[301]. The dark, rich flour produced from the seed is of high quality with overtones of coffee and chicory in the flavour[301]. The pods are also harvested when the seeds are fully formed, but still green - the pods are then lightly roasted and the seed is eaten [1297].Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain around 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated. The energy content is high in all species tested, averaging 1480 ±270 kJ per 100g. The seeds are low glycaemic index foods - the starch is digested and absorbed very slowly, producing a small, but sustained rise in blood glucose and so delaying the onset of exhaustion in prolonged exercise[1295].The roasted seed can be used as a coffee substitute[301].A white gum found on the trunk can be eaten[1297]."
20,Medicinal Uses,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DysenteryThe plant contains compounds called avicins which have been shown to inhibit inflammation and cancer in laboratory studies[1096].The bark of all Acacia species contains greater or lesser quantities of tannins and are astringent. Astringents are often used medicinally - taken internally, for example. they are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, and can also be helpful in cases of internal bleeding. Applied externally, often as a wash, they are used to treat wounds and other skin problems, haemorrhoids, perspiring feet, some eye problems, as a mouth wash etc[601, K].Many Acacia trees also yield greater or lesser quantities of a gum from the trunk and stems. This is sometimes taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and haemorrhoids[601]."
22,Other Uses,"Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses:Acacia victoriae is a fast-growing, salt-tolerant species that can readily regenerate from suckers and sometimes forms thickets. It is often used in land reclamation and mine site rehabilitation work in arid areas[286, 1297].The plant is useful as a low windbreak and for soil stabilisation in dry country[286]. It can be used for sand dune stabilization[418]. Numbers may increase markedly during a succession of wet seasons and it can become a nuisance, especially around watering points[286].In Western New South Wales the presence of this tree in any locality is always considered a sure indication of underground water. The roots have been traced to a depth of around 25 metres, and the plant always looks to be the freshest green of all the plants in the district[601].Other Uses: The branches and twigs exude a clear gum[418]. The gum is found in very small quantities[601]. Much of it is of a rich amber colour when freshly exuded, while portions of it are nearly as pale as the best Turkey gum arabic. It is sparkling and clean looking, and would be a very acceptable article of commerce if it could be obtained in quantity. It is readily and completely soluble in water, and very easily reducible to a powder, on account of its somewhat vesicular nature[601].The wood is soft, but very tough[601]. It is used traditionally for making the blades of spears[1297].The wood is used for fuel[418]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Windbreak: Linear plantings of trees and shrubs designed to enhance crop production, protect people and livestock and benefit soil and water conservation.,Historic Staple: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,New Crop: Most new crops were important wild plants until recently, although some are the result of hybridization. They have been developed in the last few, decades. What they have in common is that they are currently cultivated by farmers. Examples include baobab, argan, and buffalo gourd.,Other Systems: FMAFS: Farmer-Managed Agroforestry Farming Systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Windbreak  Historic Staple  Management: Coppice  Management: Standard  New Crop  Other Systems: FMAFS  Staple Crop: ProteinA plant of the arid and semi-arid warm temperate to tropical areas of Australia, where it is found at elevations up to 750 metres[418]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 12 - 32°c, but can tolerate 5 - 38°c[418]. Mature plants can be killed by temperatures of -10°c or lower, though young growth is more sensitive and can be killed at -1°c[418]. The plant prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range of 300 - 800mm, but tolerates 100 - 1,000mm[418].Grows best in a sunny position[418]. Succeeds in most soils, being able to tolerate occasional short-term inundation[418]. Tolerant of saline soils[1292]. Prefers a pH in the range 6 - 7.5, tolerating 5 - 8.5[418]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[418].The tree has the potential to become a weed when grown in moister climates outside its native range[418].The plant is an ornamental species suited to growing in arid and semi-arid areas, yet adaptable to cooler moist climates[1297].Acacia victoriae is an easily harvested species. The pods are held on the extremities of the branches and once fully mature, a gust of wind is sufficient to remove them. The pods may be shed unopened or may open on the plant with the seeds still attached by the funicle. Pods can be collected by manually shaking or gently beating the branches and collecting them on a groundsheet. The seeds separate from the pods with minimal mechanical processing. The plant bears uniformly heavy seed crops and is one of the few acacias whose seed can be collected from the ground[1297].The plant responds very well to coppicing, and also produces suckers[418, 1292].Trees are fast-growing[1292], but relatively short-lived, with a probable lifespan of 10 - 15 years[418].This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed of most, if not all, members of this genus has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing."
