Plants are quite tolerant of shade though do not fruit so well in such a position[11]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, though it has succeeded outdoors at Kew for many years[11] and tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. A very ornamental plant[1]. The flowers have a soft sweet perfume[245]. Plants can harbour a stage of 'white pine blister rust', so they should not be grown in the vicinity of pine trees[155]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. A suckering shrub[182].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 4 - 5 months cold stratification at between 0 to 9°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
