14,Physical Characteristics,"Viburnum tinus is an evergreen Shrub growing to 3.5 m (11ft) by 3.5 m (11ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from December to February, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure."

22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in both acid and alkaline soils but it is ill-adapted for poor soils and dry situations[1, 202]. Prefers a deep rich loamy soil in sun or semi-shade[11] but flowers better in a sunny position[182]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Best if given shade from the early morning sun in spring[200]. Thrives in moderate shade but is better in full sun[11]. A fairly wind resistant plant but it requires shelter from cold northerly and north-easterly winds[75, 200]. This species is hardy to about -10°c, it does not thrive in the colder areas of the country[182]. A very variable plant, there are a number of named varieties[11, 182]. Fast growing when young, though slowing with age[202]. Very tolerant of pruning, plants quickly regenerate even from old wood[202]. Plants give off an offensive smell in wet weather[182]. Plants occasionally self-sow in Britain[17]. Plants are self-incompatible and need to grow close to a genetically distinct plant in the same species in order to produce fruit and fertile seed[11, 200].  Special Features:Not North American native, Attracts butterflies, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Germination can be slow, sometimes taking more than 18 months. If the seed is harvested 'green' (when it has fully developed but before it has fully ripened) and sown immediately in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring[80]. Stored seed will require 2 months warm then 3 months cold stratification and can still take 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse. Plant out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of soft-wood, early summer in a frame[200]. Pot up into individual pots once they start to root and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 8 cm long with a heel if possible, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Plant them into individual pots as soon as they start to root. These cuttings can be difficult to overwinter, it is best to keep them in a greenhouse or cold frame until the following spring before planting them out[113]. Cuttings of mature wood, winter in a frame. They should root in early spring - pot them up when large enough to handle and plant them out in the summer if sufficient new growth is made, otherwise keep them in a cold frame for the next winter and then plant them out in the spring. Layering of current seasons growth in July/August. Takes 15 months[78]."
