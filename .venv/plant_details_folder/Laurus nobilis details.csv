The leaves can be used fresh or are harvested in the summer and dried. The flavour of freshly dried, crushed or shredded leaves is stronger than fresh leaves, but the leaves should not be stored for longer than a year since they will then lose their flavour[238]. The dried fruit is used as a flavouring[142, 177, 183]. The dried leaves are brewed into a herbal tea[183]. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used as a food flavouring[183].

It has also been used to treat various types of cancer[218]. The fruits and leaves are not usually administered internally, other than as a stimulant in veterinary practice, but were formerly employed in the treatment of hysteria, amenorrhoea, flatulent colic etc[4]. Another report says that the leaves are used mainly to treat upper respiratory tract disorders and to ease arthritic aches and pains[254]. It is settling to the stomach and has a tonic effect, stimulating the appetite and the secretion of digestive juices[254]. The leaves are antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emetic in large doses, emmenagogue, narcotic, parasiticide, stimulant and stomachic[4, 7, 21, 210, 218].

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Screen, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in any soil of moderate fertility[1], preferring a moisture retentive well-drained fertile soil[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Prefers full sun but succeeds in light shade[200]. Plants are fairly wind hardy, but they do not like extreme maritime exposure[166] or cold dry winds[202]. The plant is not fully hardy in all areas of Britain and may require protection in severe winters. When dormant it is reliably hardy to about -5°c, with occasional lows to -15°c, these lower temperatures may defoliate the tree but it usually recovers in late spring to summer[200]. Laurus nobilis angustifolia (Syn 'Salicifolia') is somewhat hardier and has the same aromatic qualities[182]. The bay tree is a very ornamental plant[1] that is often cultivated for its leaves which are used as a food flavouring. Some named forms exist[202]. When bruised, the leaves release a sweet aromatic scent[245]. The tree is highly resistant to pests and diseases[14, 201] and is also notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has been held in high esteem since ancient times[244]. It was dedicated to Apollo, the god of light and was also a symbol of peace and victory[244]. It was used to make wreaths for emperors, generals and poets[11, 89, 244]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Can take 6 months[1, 14]. Cuttings of mature side shoots, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November/December in a cold frame. Leave for 18 months. High percentage[78]. Layering.",
