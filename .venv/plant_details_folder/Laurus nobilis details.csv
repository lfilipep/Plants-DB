See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.

A spicy, aromatic flavouring, bay leaves are commonly used as a flavouring for soups, stews etc[7, 11, 15, 34, 183] and form an essential ingredient of the herb mix 'Bouquet Garni'[201, 238]. The leaves can be used fresh or are harvested in the summer and dried. The flavour of freshly dried, crushed or shredded leaves is stronger than fresh leaves, but the leaves should not be stored for longer than a year since they will then lose their flavour[238]. The dried fruit is used as a flavouring[142, 177, 183]. The dried leaves are brewed into a herbal tea[183]. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used as a food flavouring[183]. Yields can vary from 1 - 3% oil[7].","Abortifacient: Causes an abortion.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Appetizer: Improves the appetite,Aromatic: Having an agreeable odour and stimulant qualities.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Digestive: Aids digestion.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Emetic: Induces vomiting.,Emmenagogue: Promotes or increases the menstrual flow.

It has also been used to treat various types of cancer[218]. The fruits and leaves are not usually administered internally, other than as a stimulant in veterinary practice, but were formerly employed in the treatment of hysteria, amenorrhoea, flatulent colic etc[4]. Another report says that the leaves are used mainly to treat upper respiratory tract disorders and to ease arthritic aches and pains[254]. It is settling to the stomach and has a tonic effect, stimulating the appetite and the secretion of digestive juices[254]. The leaves are antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, carminative, diaphoretic, digestive, diuretic, emetic in large doses, emmenagogue, narcotic, parasiticide, stimulant and stomachic[4, 7, 21, 210, 218]. The fruit is antiseptic, aromatic, digestive, narcotic and stimulant[218]. An infusion has been used to improve the appetite and as an emmenagogue[4]. The fruit has also been used in making carminative medicines and was used in the past to promote abortion[4]. A fixed oil from the fruit is used externally to treat sprains, bruises etc, and is sometimes used as ear drops to relieve pain[4]. The essential oil from the leaves has narcotic, antibacterial and fungicidal properties[218].","Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.,Strewing: Plants, usually aromatic, that are strewn on the floor to give a nice smell, repel insects etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","An essential oil from the fruit is used in soap making[7, 46, 61]. The plant is highly resistant to pests and diseases, it is said to protect neighbouring plants from insect and health problems[14]. The leaves are highly aromatic and can be used as an insect repellent, the dried leaves protect stored grain, beans etc from weevils[14]. It is also used as a strewing herb because of its aromatic smell and antiseptic properties[244]. Very tolerant of clipping[11, 200], it can be grown as a screen or hedge in areas suited to its outdoor cultivation[182, 200].  - sweetly-scented, does not wear quickly. Used for marqueterie work, walking sticks and friction sticks for making fires[4, 89].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Screen, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in any soil of moderate fertility[1], preferring a moisture retentive well-drained fertile soil[200]. Succeeds in dry soils. Prefers full sun but succeeds in light shade[200]. Plants are fairly wind hardy, but they do not like extreme maritime exposure[166] or cold dry winds[202]. The plant is not fully hardy in all areas of Britain and may require protection in severe winters. When dormant it is reliably hardy to about -5°c, with occasional lows to -15°c, these lower temperatures may defoliate the tree but it usually recovers in late spring to summer[200]. Laurus nobilis angustifolia (Syn 'Salicifolia') is somewhat hardier and has the same aromatic qualities[182]. The bay tree is a very ornamental plant[1] that is often cultivated for its leaves which are used as a food flavouring. Some named forms exist[202]. When bruised, the leaves release a sweet aromatic scent[245]. The tree is highly resistant to pests and diseases[14, 201] and is also notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. This species has been held in high esteem since ancient times[244]. It was dedicated to Apollo, the god of light and was also a symbol of peace and victory[244]. It was used to make wreaths for emperors, generals and poets[11, 89, 244]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Fragrant foliage, Not North American native. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early autumn in a greenhouse[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first year. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and give them some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Can take 6 months[1, 14]. Cuttings of mature side shoots, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November/December in a cold frame. Leave for 18 months.
