4,Known Hazards,"The roots contain saponins[222]. Whilst saponins are quite toxic to people, they are poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass straight through. They are also destroyed by prolonged heat, such as slow baking in an oven. Saponins are found in many common foods such as beans[K]. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K].",

13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Yucca filifera is an evergreen Shrub growing to 10 m (32ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Hand.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked. Flowers - raw or cooked. Delicious raw, they can also be dried, crushed and used as a flavouring[164]. Flowering stem - cooked and used like asparagus[164].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.",
23,Other Uses Description,"A fibre obtained from the leaves is used for making ropes, baskets and mats[82, 169]. The roots are rich in saponins and can be used as a soap substitute[82].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in any soil but prefers a sandy loam and full exposure to the south[11]. Can succeed in light shade[K]. Plants are hardier when grown on poor sandy soils[200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[200]. Hardy to at least -5°c according to one report[200], whilst another says that it is hardy to about -30c[164]. The leaves can be damaged by strong winds[11]. In the plants native environment, its flowers can only be pollinated by a certain species of moth. This moth cannot live in Britain and, if fruit and seed is required, hand pollination is necessary. This can be quite easily and successfully done using something like a small paint brush. Individual crowns are monocarpic, dying after flowering[233]. However, the crown will usually produce a number of sideshoots before it dies and these will grow on to flower in about four years[233]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Members of this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. Pre-soaking the seed for 24 hours in warm water may reduce the germination time. It usually germinates within 1 - 12 months if kept at a temperature of 20°c. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for at least their first two winters. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some winter protection for at least their first winter outdoors - a simple pane of glass is usually sufficient[K]. Seed is not produced in Britain unless the flowers are hand pollinated. Root cuttings in late winter or early spring. Lift in April/May and remove small buds from base of stem and rhizomes. Dip in dry wood ashes to stop any bleeding and plant in a sandy soil in pots in a greenhouse until established[78]. Division of suckers in late spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the following spring.,
