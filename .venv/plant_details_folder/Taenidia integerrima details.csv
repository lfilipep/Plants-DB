19,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Native American ethnobotany. The Menominee take an infusion of root taken for pulmonary troubles, chew the steeped root for 'bronchial affections', and use it as a seasoner for other remedies because of the good smell. The Ojibwe smoke the seeds in a pipe before hunting for good luck."
20,Other Uses,
21,Other Uses Description,"Garden Uses: Woodland gardens. Native US plant gardens. Not commonly found in cultivation. Invertebrates shelter: beneficial for insects and other arthropods. Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. The flowers attract small bees, wasps (including parasitic wasps), flies, and beetles. These insects seek nectar primarily, although some bees may collect pollen and some flies and beetles may feed on pollen. Some of the fly visitors include Syrphid flies, Tachinid flies, Chloropid flies, March flies, and Blow flies, while bee visitors include Nomadine bees, Little Carpenter bees, Halictid bees, Carder bees, and Andrenid bees. The caterpillars of the butterflies Papilio polyxenes asterias (Black Swallowtail) and Papilio joanae (Ozark Swallowtail) feed on the foliage of this plant; the latter insect has not been observed in Illinois, although it has been found in Missouri and western Kentucky. Little information is available about this plant's relationships to birds and mammals as a possible food source [1-6]."
22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"An herbaceous perennial plant in the parsley family.  The preference is partial to full sun and dry to medium conditions. Tolerates close to full shade. Poor soil is preferred, consisting of clay, rocky material, or some sand, as this reduces the competition from other plants. This plant adapts well to slopes, although it may not remain very erect. Drought resistance is very good. Bloom Time: May to July. Bloom Description: Yellow. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2]."
