Invertebrates shelter: beneficial for insects and other arthropods. Nectary: provides nectar or pollen for beneficial insects [1-2]. The flowers attract small bees, wasps (including parasitic wasps), flies, and beetles. These insects seek nectar primarily, although some bees may collect pollen and some flies and beetles may feed on pollen. Some of the fly visitors include Syrphid flies, Tachinid flies, Chloropid flies, March flies, and Blow flies, while bee visitors include Nomadine bees, Little Carpenter bees, Halictid bees, Carder bees, and Andrenid bees. The caterpillars of the butterflies Papilio polyxenes asterias (Black Swallowtail) and Papilio joanae (Ozark Swallowtail) feed on the foliage of this plant; the latter insect has not been observed in Illinois, although it has been found in Missouri and western Kentucky.

Drought resistance is very good. Bloom Time: May to July. Bloom Description: Yellow. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].",Seed.
