There is some confusion over the name of this species, C. foetida (Auct.) is given as a synonym for C. europaea Schipez (said to be native to E. Europe) whilst another authority cites C. europaea as a synonym of C. foetida. It is possible that entries under this species apply also (or instead) to C. europaea[50]. A very attractive plant, but the flowers and the green seed pods have an unusual, slightly unpleasant smell[188] that is reminiscent of decaying fish[245].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[1]. Only just cover the seed. It germinates in 1 - 12 months or even longer at 15°c[164]. The seed does not store well and soon loses its viability[200], stored seed may germinate better if given 6 - 8 weeks warm stratification at 15°c and then 8 weeks cold stratification[164]. Prick out the young seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer[K]. Division in spring or autumn[1]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
