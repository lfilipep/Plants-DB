Requires a well-drained neutral to acid soil[188]. Requires a sunny sheltered position when grown outdoors in Britain[175]. Plants succeed in heavy shade in Australian gardens[157] but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers that see much less sun than Australia. Plants are hardy to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] but only succeed outdoors in the southern part of the country and even then require a very sheltered well-drained situation[1]. Although not very cold-tolerant, this species can survive in sheltered stable environments in dappled shade, such as a woodland, if temperatures do not drop far below zero for long periods[200]. A polymorphic species[157], some forms are very ornamental[1].","Seed - pre-soak for 24 hours in luke-warm water and then sow in spring in gentle heat in a greenhouse. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 3 months at 25°c[175]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first two years. When large enough, plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Division as the plants come into growth in the spring[188]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
