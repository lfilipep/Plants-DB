This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it can be grown outdoors as a half-hardy annual in this country[1]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters.

When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer.
