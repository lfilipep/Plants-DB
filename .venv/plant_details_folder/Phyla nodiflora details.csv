Perennial groundcover for zone 2 firebreaks. The US government has created a system of firebreaks for areas prone to wildfires, theses are separated into concentric zones surrounding buildings. Zone 2 is the second away from the house. These low-level groundcovers provide little fuel.",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in any well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Prefers a moderately fertile soil, but succeeds in soils of low fertility[200]. Prefers ample moisture according to one report[157], whilst another says that, once established, it is drought tolerant[200]. When grown in shade the plant makes a lot of vegetative growth but does not flower well[157]. This species is not very hardy in Britain, though it can be grown outdoors as a half-hardy annual in this country[1]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157] though this cannot be translated directly to British gardens due to our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. Heat Zone: 12-10.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in the middle of spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in late spring or early summer. If trying to grow this plant as a perennial do not plant them out the first spring but grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring.",
