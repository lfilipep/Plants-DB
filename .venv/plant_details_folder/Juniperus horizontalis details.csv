America - Newfoundland to British Columbia, south to Washington and Maine.",(2 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/JuniperusHorizontalis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/JuniperusHorizontalis2.jpg",Bloom Color: Blue.,"Juniperus horizontalis is an evergreen Shrub growing to 1 m (3ft 3in) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline and saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Ground Cover;,,"Coffee: the various substitutes that can be used instead of coffee.,Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","eaThe fruits are roasted and used in the preparation of a coffee-like beverage[183]. A tea is made from the young branch tips[183, 257].","Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Diaphoretic  Febrifuge  KidneyAn infusion of the branches, or fleshy cones, has been used in the treatment of coughs, colds and fevers[257]. The cones or branches can also be used as a steam bath[257]. An infusion of the seeds has been used in the treatment of kidney problems[257].","Baby care: Various plants that can be used in place of items such as nappies.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.","Landscape Uses: Cascades, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Rock garden, Seashore. A good ground cover plant for a sunny position[208], eventually making a dense cover though it requires weeding for the first year or so[197]. The bark has been crushed and used as a soft hygienic pad in cradles[257]. It has also been used to make mats[257]. The young twigs and leaves have been burnt as an incense[257].",,"Succeeds in a sunny position in most soils so long as they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[11] and succeeding on chalk[200]. Succeeds in dry soils[200]. An aggregate species[204]. There are many named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Bar Harbour' is very salt-resistant[200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant foliage, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface [2-1].","The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
