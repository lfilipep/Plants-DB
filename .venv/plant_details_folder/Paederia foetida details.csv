13,Summary,"A fast-growing vine with stems reaching up to 7 m long that twine into other plants for support and commonly grown in East Asia is known as Skunk Vine or Paederia foetida. The leaves of this plant are opposite and narrowly oval and the flowers are gray-purple. The fruits are oval and red or yellow. Skunk vine has great potential to be a weed as it can become naturalized in many areas and seeds can easily be dispersed by birds. The leaves are edible. With a strong flavor and odor, it is often cooked or eaten raw as a side dish. The leaves are also used medicinally particularly in the treatment of digestive or intestinal conditions. It can also be applied externally for swellings and bruises. Leaf juice is used to treat diarrhea in children. The fruit is used for toothache.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Paederia foetida is a CLIMBER growing to 4 m (13ft) by 0.3 m (1ft in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. The flowers are pollinated by Bees, Butterflies. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil.

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[301 ]. Although they have a strong flavour, the leaves are sometimes mixed with grated coconut and spices, and then eaten raw as a side-dish with rice[301 , 310 ]. The minced leaves are steamed and eaten; they can be added to soups; or are mixed with various vegetables and spices, then wrapped in a banana leaf and cooked over a fire[301 ]. Any offensive smell disappears as the leaves are cooked[301 ]. The leaves are valued more for their medicinal virtues than for their flavour![K ]. The sweet stem juice is sucked in Taiwan[177 , 183 ].",

Also see Astringent.,Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Antivinous: Treats addiction to alcohol,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Depurative: Eliminates toxins and purifies the system, especially the blood.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Restorative: Restores consciousness or normal physiological activity.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiarthritic  Antidiarrhoeal  Antidote  Antiinflammatory  Antirheumatic  Antitumor  Antivinous  Astringent  Cancer  Carminative  Depurative  Diuretic  Dysentery  Restorative  Tonic  VermifugeThe leaves are widely used in Asia and South-East Asia, where they are especially valued for treating digestive problems[310 ]. Considerable research has been carried out into the medicinal benefits of the plants, with several active compounds having been recorded[310 ]. Several iridoid glucosides such as asperuloside, scandoside and paederoside have been isolated from the aerial parts of the plant[310 ]. These glucosides have displayed antitumor activity with paederoside displaying the highest degree of antitumor-promoting activity[310 ]. Scandoside has been shown to promote the growth of lettuce seedlings. Paederoside showed a similar inhibitory activity to that of asperuloside and daecetyl-asperulosidic acid in a plant growth inhibition test and in an antimicroorganism activity test[310 ]. The bruised aerial parts of the plant have the fetid odour of indole (methyl-mercaptan). Damage to the tissue releases an enzyme which splits off this sulphur-containing group from paederoside, and is therefore responsible for the unpleasant odour. The most abundant sulphur-containing compound was dimethyl disulphide[310 ]. The presence of alkaloids and an essential oil have also been recorded[310 ]. Monoterpenes such as linalol constitute the major components in the oil[310 ]. In older investigations, decoctions of the plant showed significant anti-inflammatory action against arthritis[310 ]. The decoction also exhibited marked activity against degenerative osteo-arthritis[310 ]. The water soluble fraction of the aerial parts displayed anti-inflammatory activity in oedema[310 ]. It failed to exhibit any analgesic or antipyretic action and showed no ulcerogenic potential[310 ]. An ethanolic extract of the leaves has shown anticancer activity against human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx[310 ]. A methanol extract of the leaves has shown hepatoprotective potential, being effective in reversing 6 out of 12 common biochemical (enzymatic) parameters assessed[310 ]. Another study has shown that the plant has antidiarrhoeal activity, acting by inhibiting intestinal motility - thus supporting its use in traditional medicine[360 ]. The leaves are anodyne, antirheumatic, antivinous, astringent, carminative, depurative, diuretic, restorative and vermifuge[147 , 218 , 310 ]. They are commonly used for the treatment of intestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, colic, cramps, flatulence and dysentery; and are also used for treating rheumatism and gout[147 , 218 , 310 ]. The leaves are also used to treat infertility and paralysis[218 ]. The leaves and stems are also used as a diuretic for inflammation of the urethra[310 ]. For treating intestinal problems, the fresh leaves are pounded, water added, and the filtered infusion is drunk regularly till convalescence[310 ]. The plant is considered to have great restorative powers, and the leaves may thus be mixed with food, boiled and eaten - in India, they are often boiled in soup to lessen their smell[310 ]. Applied externally, the leaves are used to treat swellings and bruises in general, and are mashed then applied for earache, ulcerations of the nose and swollen eyes[272 , 310 ]. They are used as a poultice for treating a swollen belly, distension, herpes or ringworm; and are used in antirheumatic baths[310 ]. They are applied to the abdomen as a diuretic, and also as a solvent for vesical stones[310 ]. The juice of the leaves is considered astringent, and is used to treat diarrhoea in children[310 ]. The bark and the root are considered to be emetic[310 ]. The juice of the root is prescribed in cases of indigestion, piles, inflammation of the spleen, and pain in the chest and liver[272 , 310 ]. It may help to eliminate poisons collected in the system[310 ]. In some parts of India, the fruit is used to blacken teeth, and it is also considered a medicine to prevent and treat toothache[310 , 360 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Insecticide: Kills insects.,Plant breeding: Used in producing new species of plants or improved varieties.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses The stem yields a strong and silky fibre, but it is not commercially exploited[310 ]. An ethanolic extract of the leaves and stem has been shown to be significantly toxic against the aphid Myzus persicae infesting cabbage in India[310 ]",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Found in a range of environments from the warm temperate zone to the tropics. It is tolerant of at least some frost[413 ]. Succeeds in any fertile soil so long as it is well drained[182 , 219 ]. Plants have a wide ranging adaptability to different levels of light, types of soil, and salt conditions[413 ]. Requires a sunny sheltered position[219 ]. A very variable plant[58 ]. The plant has escaped from cultivation and become naturalised in many areas[310 ]. It has become a serious weed of young sugarcane[305 ]. The vines climb over shrubs and trees, weighing them down and impeding regeneration[413 ]. They also invade pastureland and are troublesome along roads and on power lines[413 ]. The seeds may be dispersed by birds and the plant is also spread by the transport of rooted fragments[413 ]. The plant can be found flowering and fruiting throughout the year in tropical and subtropical conditions; in other localities, it flowers during the rainy season, and fruits early in the dry season[310 ]. Individual flowers are short-lived, open early in the morning and fall off after 2 days; entire inflorescences, however, bear flowers for a long period of time[310 ]. Flowering Time: Mid Summer Late Summer/Early Fall. Bloom Color: Red White/Near White.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - despite its weediness, the plant germinates rather slowly, with tetraploids germinating quicker than hexaploids, in 5 - 22 days, or in 17 - 24 days, respectively[310 ]. Layering. Sometimes, shoots produce adventitious roots when they come in contact with the soil, and can thus be propagated[310 ]",
