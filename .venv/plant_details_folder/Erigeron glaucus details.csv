It prefers dry or  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds;,,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously.

Best in a sandy dry soil[187]. Succeeds in fairly heavy soils[208]. Succeeds in very exposed positions[166] and grows best in mild maritime areas[208]. Intolerant of winter damp[188]. Plants are hardy to about -10°c[187]. A good butterfly and moth plant[30]. There are some named varieties selected for their ornamental value[208]. The bruised leaves have a balsamic perfume[245]. Does well in the border or rock garden[1]. Very few members of this genus will hybridise with other members of the genus[274].","Seed - sow spring in situ. The seed usually germinates within four weeks[111]. Division in spring or autumn[111]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 5 - 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Cuttings of semi-ripe shoots in summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
