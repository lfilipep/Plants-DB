It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

Sugary, but malodorous and has purgative properties if eaten in quantity[301 , 331 ].",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The bitter fruit pulp is used as a laxative and purgative similar to C. fistula and reported to be more powerful[303 , 348 , 739 ]. Drunk with milk, it is said to fight anaemia and add iron to the blood[510 ]. The ripe pods and seeds are also used as a laxative[303 ]. A decoction of the leaves is used as a laxative and in the treatment of lumbago[303 ]. The fresh juice of the leaves is used externally in the treatment of ringworm[303 ]. An ointment made from lard and the crushed leaves is employed commonly in treating cutaneous diseases, especially mange and other skin affections in dogs[331 ].",Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,"Agroforestry Uses: A fast-growing tree it can be used as a pioneer species when re-establishing woodland[419 ]. Other Uses: The seeds are a potential commercial source of gums[303 ]. Seed gum can be used as a binder for the pharmaceutical industry[303 ]. The ashes of the wood are employed in soap-making[331 ]. The wood is brownish yellow, rather hard and heavy, coarse-textured and not durable[331 ]. A strong, multipurpose wood, it is used for building construction - mainly for internal finish, agricultural implements etc[303 , 317 , 331 , 419 ]. It is also used for fence posts[317 ]. The wood is used for fuel[303 , 331 ]. An important bee plant.","Agroforestry Services: Crop shade: Plants providing crop shade especially trees.,Agroforestry Services: Living fence: Simply managed rows of shrubs and trees.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Sugar: Perennial sugar crops include sugarcane and compare favorably to annuals.","Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Agroforestry Services: Living fence  Fodder: Pod  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: SugarA plant of the lowland moist tropics, found at elevations below 900 metres[303 , 331 ]. It is found in areas where the mean annual rainfall is in the range 1,000 - 2,800 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 21 - 26c with a mean maximum of 24 - 30c and a mean minimum of 17 - 25c[303 ]. Prefers a sunny position[419 ]. Succeeds in a wide range of soils[419 ]. The plant is common as an ornamental and garden escape in Malaysia, Java and New Guinea[310 ]. A fast-growing plant[419 ]. The fruit takes 10 - 12 months to mature from flowering[303 ].","Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and may benefit from scarification before sowing to speed up germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the seed in a partially shaded position in a nursery seedbed. A germination rate in excess of 60% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 8 - 12 days[419 ]. When the seedlings are 4 - 6cm tall, pot them up into individual containers and they should be ready to plant out 5 - 6 months later[419 ]. Seed can be stored for prolonged periods without loss of viability[303 ]. Cuttings. In Costa Rica, the plant is propagated by means of large cuttings ('epicormic shoots'). Vertical shoots of 15 cm in diameter are cut and trimmed to a length of 2.5 metres. These are laid out in the shade for a week and then stacked vertically for three weeks. Then they are planted, with the lower ends buried 50 cm deep in the soil[303 ].
