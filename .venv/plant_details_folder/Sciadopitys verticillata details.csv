See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower in May, and the seeds ripen from October to November. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Bog Garden;,,"Oil: Oil,Oil: ",e known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Used for boats etc[46, 61].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Container, Pest tolerant, Screen, Specimen. Prefers a good loamy soil[11]. Grows well near water, tolerating a wet site[81]. Thrives in all conditions except limey soils[81]. It prefers a pH in the range of 4 to 6, and although it will grow at pH 7 or above it becomes chlorotic[200]. Tolerates some shade but prefers an open position in full sun[81]. Dislikes cold or violent winds[1]. Grows best in mild damp areas with warm humid summers[200]. A very hardy plant[11], tolerating temperatures down to about -30°c when it is fully dormant[200]. A slow-growing tree when very young[11, 81]. Some trees have grown slowly but generally they are of moderate growth in Britain, often averaging 30cm a year and increasing their girth by 2.5cm a year[185]. The cones ripen over a period of 2 years[188]. There are two forms of this species, one is shrub-like whilst the other is a tall-growing tree[11]. Plants should be put into their permanent positions as soon as possible in order for them to develop a good root system, plants more than 1 metre tall check badly for a number of years[200]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",Seed - requires 3 months cold stratification and so it can be sown in a cold frame either as soon as it is ripe in the autumn or in January[113]. Only cover the seed lightly and place the pot in a sunny position[113]. The seed can be difficult to germinate[81]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the cold frame for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. The seedlings are very slow-growing and take about 3 years to reach 30cm tall[113] so be sure to mulch them well and perhaps give them some protection such as a tree guard made from a plastic bottle with its top and bottom removed[K].,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
