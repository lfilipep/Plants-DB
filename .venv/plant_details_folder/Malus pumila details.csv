0,Malus pumila,"Paradise Apple, Common Apple, Apple Tree",Rosaceae,3-9,"All members of this genus contain the toxin hydrogen cyanide in their seeds and possibly also in their leaves, but not in their fruits. Hydrogen cyanide is the substance that gives almonds their characteristic taste but it should only be consumed in very small quantities. Apple seeds do not normally contain very high quantities of hydrogen cyanide but, even so, should not be consumed in very large quantities. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",Not known in a truly wild situation[74].,"Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to Spain, Greece and S.W.

Main Bloom Time: Mid spring. Form: Oval, Spreading or horizontal, Upright or erect.","Malus pumila is a deciduous Tree growing to 7 m (23ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in April. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Pyrus malus pumila.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw, cooked in pies, cakes etc or fermented into cider[183]. The taste can be sweet and pleasant. The fruit can be up to 6cm in diameter[200].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Bach: Plants used in the Bach flower remedies.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Refrigerant: Cools the body.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anthelmintic  Antibacterial  Bach  Hypnotic  RefrigerantThe bark, and especially the root bark, is anthelmintic, refrigerant and soporific[218, 240]. An infusion is used in the treatment of intermittent, remittent and bilious fevers[240]. The fruit is said to dispel gas, dissolve mucous, cure flux and be a tonic for anaemia, bilious disorders and colic[218]. The leaves contain up to 2.4% of an antibacterial substance called 'phloretin'[240]. This inhibits the growth of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in as low a concentration as 30 ppm[240]. The plant is used in Bach flower remedies - the keywords for prescribing it are 'The cleansing remedy', 'Despondency' and 'Despair'[209].","Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Rootstock: Plants used as the rootstock for grafting scions onto.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Used as a rootstock for the cultivated apples, there are several named varieties[50]. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark[257]. A dynamic accumulator gathering minerals or nutrients from the soil and storing them in a more bioavailable form - used as fertilizer or to improve mulch. Landscape Uses: Container, Espalier, Specimen.",,"An overstory and understory tree (can grow and fruit in some shade). An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most fertile soils, preferring a moisture retentive well-drained loamy soil[1, 200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a sunny position but succeeds in partial shade though it fruits less well in such a situation[1, 200]. A parent of the cultivated apple[200], it is occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit and also as a dwarfing rootstock[50]. There are some named forms[200]. The fruit is a good wildlife food source, especially for birds[200]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200].

For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It usually germinates in late winter. Stored seed requires stratification for 3 months at 1°c and should be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is received[200]. It might not germinate for 12 months or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If given a rich compost they usually grow away quickly and can be large enough to plant out in late summer, though consider giving them some protection from the cold in their first winter. Otherwise, keep them in pots in a cold frame and plant them out in late spring of the following year.
