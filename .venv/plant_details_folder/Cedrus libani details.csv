Used for construction[1, 46, 61]. The wood is extremely durable and retains its delightful fragrance for many years[245].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Pest tolerant, Specimen. Thrives on most soils, being very tolerant of chalk, dry sites and of drought when it is established[11, 81, 200]. Prefers a rich loam or a sandy clay in full sun[1]. Succeeds in warm dry areas with less than 40cm of rain a year, but also in areas with cool summers and up to 200cm of rain[200]. Very intolerant of atmospheric pollution[11, 81]. Small trees less than 50cm tall establish much quicker and better than taller trees, those more than 2 metres tall are difficult to establish[200]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Fairly slow growing, trees rarely average more than 30cm increase in height per year[185]. Trees can be very long lived, to 300 years or more[185]. There are several named varieties selected for their ornamental value[188]. Small male cones are formed on the lower branches of trees, whilst the larger female cones are formed on higher branches[238]. These female cones persist on the tree for 2 - 3 years before breaking up[238]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[81, 200]. The trees have a broad canopy and tend to hold any falling snow. This can lead to branches being broken by the weight of snow[81]. Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - collect the cones in winter and keep in a warm room until they open[1]. Sow immediately in a cold frame[78]. One report says that a short cold stratification of one month improves germination rates[113]. Keep the seed pot moist, but be careful because the young seedlings are very prone to damp off, keep them well ventilated[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings of terminal shoots can be tried in a frame in November but they are very difficult[113].",
