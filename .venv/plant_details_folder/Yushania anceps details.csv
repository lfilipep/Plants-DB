See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9. It is in leaf all year. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",Arundinaria anceps. Arundinaria jaunsarensis. Fargesia jaunsarensis.

Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Plant support: Usually bamboos, used as canes in the garden for holding up plants.","Canes are used as plant supports and in basketry, they must be properly ripened[25, 158, 195]. The plant makes an attractive hedge or screen, eventually becoming very dense[195].",,"Prefers an open loam of fair quality[200] and a position sheltered from cold drying winds[11]. Succeeds on peaty soils. Requires abundant moisture and plenty of organic matter in the soil[1, 11]. Grows well in light woodland[122]. A very ornamental plant[11], it often loses its leaves in winter but is very hardy in Britain[25]. Another report says that it is only hardy in the milder areas of Britain whilst yet another says that it tolerates temperatures down to about -20°c. The rhizome is running and can be invasive[11, 25, 122]. It is fairly easy to control, however, because the new shoots are brittle and easily broken off of the plant. New shoots are produced from late May[25]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants often flower in Britain, sometimes continuously over a number of years, they are not monocarpic and often produce viable seed[122]. Plants can be badly weakened by flowering but they usually recover, however they are likely to be killed if they are given artificial NPK fertilizers at this time[122].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until the seedlings are large enough to plant out, which could take a few years. Seed is rarely available. Division in late spring[25]. Best done as the new shoots first appear above ground[25]. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200].
