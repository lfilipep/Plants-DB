22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a fertile well-drained but moist soil in a sheltered sunny position[200]. Plants are not very hardy in Britain, they only succeed outdoors in the milder parts of the country tolerating temperatures down to between -5 to -10°c[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest surface sowing the seed in a greenhouse in spring. Do not allow the compost to dry out. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on for at least the first winter in a greenhouse, planting them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring as the plant comes into growth. The divisions can be planted out straight into their permanent positions, though it might be safer to get them established and growing well in pots first."
