22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"This subspecies totora, Schoenoplectus californicus subsp, is famous for making up the floating islands of Lake Titicaca dwell. On the mid-coast of Peru, totora has been used for over 3,000 years to build caballitos de totora - small rowed and straddled fishing vessels. The tough, soft culms are used for making mats, baskets, chair seats, houses, boats, and other objects[270, 331]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Industrial Crop: biomass (Crops grown for non-food uses. Industrial crops provide resources in three main categories: materials, chemicals, and energy. Traditional materials include lumber and thatch, paper and cardboard, and textiles) [1-1]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Regional CropClimate: tropical highlands. Humidity: aquatic. A plant of low to medium elevations in the warm temperate to tropical zones. Growing in moist and wet terrestrial habitat, and in shallow water. The root system is well-developed. Prefers waterlogged soils in full sun or part shade. Often grows at a water depth of 2.5–3m (8.2–9.8ft) but occurs less frequently as deep as 5.5m (18ft). Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: hay (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
