18,Edible Uses,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil)."
19,Edible Uses Description,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.EczemaGumplant was used by the native North American Indians to treat bronchial problems and also skin afflictions such as reactions to poison ivy[254 ]. It is still used in modern herbalism where it is valued especially as a treatment for bronchial asthma and for states where phlegm in the airways impedes respiration[254 ]. In addition, it is believed to desensitize the nerve endings in the bronchial tree and slow the heart rate, thus leading to easier breathing[254 ]. The herb is contraindicated for patients with kidney or heart complaints[254 ]. The dried leaves and flowering tops are antiasthmatic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, expectorant and sedative[4 , 61 , 165 , 238 ]. The principal use of this herb is in the treatment of bronchial catarrh, especially when there is an asthmatic tendency, it is also used to treat whooping cough and cystitis[4 , 61 , 238 ]. The active principle is excreted from the kidneys, and this sometimes produces signs of renal irritation[4 , 238 ]. Externally, the plant is used to treat burns, poison ivy rash, dermatitis, eczema and skin eruptions[61 , 238 ]. The plant is harvested when in full bloom and can be used fresh as a poultice or dried for infusions etc[238 ]. A homeopathic remedy is prepared from the leaves and flowering stems[4 ]."
22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Yellow and green dyes are obtained from the flowering heads and pods[168 ]. Aromatic. A possible substitute for wood rosin, used in the manufacture of adhesives etc[160 ]. This report probably refers to the resin that covers the flower buds. Carbon Farming - Industrial Crop: hydrocarbon."
24,Cultivation Details,"Experimental Crop: Plant breeders are testing these plants to see if they could be domesticated for cultivation, but they are still in an experimental phase. Examples include milkweed and leafy spurge.,Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Experimental Crop  Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon  Management: HayClimate: cold to warm temperate. Humidity: arid to semi-arid. Succeeds in any well-drained soil in full sun[200 ]. Does well on dry sandy banks and in poor soils[200 ]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200 ]. A very variable species, it is comprised of a number of forms that were previously recognised as distinct species but, in the Flora of North America[270 ], have all been treated as synonyms of this species. A number of these species are included in this database and, for the present are all being retained here. Species affected are Grindelia camporum, Grindelia humilis and Grindelia robusta[K ]. All parts of the plant have a balsamic odour[238 ]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: experimental. Management: hay."
