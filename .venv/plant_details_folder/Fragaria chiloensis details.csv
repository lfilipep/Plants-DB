24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile, well-drained, moisture retentive soil in a sunny position[27, 200]. Tolerates semi-shade though fruit production will be reduced. Grows best near the coast[27]. Plants like a mulch of pine or spruce leaves[18]. Cultivated for its edible fruit in the Andes[61]. This species, along with F. virginiana, is probably a parent of the cultivated strawberries[46]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. An evergreen. The plant growth habit is a runner spreading indefinitely by rhizomes or stolons [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]. Heat zone 9-1. Can be mown in early spring.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 4 weeks or more to germinate. The seedlings are very small and slow-growing at first, but then grow rapidly. Prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out during the summer. Division of runners, preferably done in July/August in order to allow the plants to become established for the following years crop[200]. They can also be moved in the following spring if required, though should not then be allowed to fruit in their first year. The runners can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.",
