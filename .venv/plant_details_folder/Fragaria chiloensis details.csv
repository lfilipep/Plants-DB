The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2]. Heat zone 9-1. Can be mown in early spring.","Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 4 weeks or more to germinate. The seedlings are very small and slow-growing at first, but then grow rapidly. Prick them out into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out during the summer.
