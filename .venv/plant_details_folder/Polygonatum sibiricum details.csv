24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a fertile humus rich moisture retentive well-drained soil in cool shade or semi-shade[200]. Plants are intolerant of heat and drought but tolerate most other conditions[200]. This species is closely related to P. verticillatum[200]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer or rabbits[233]. The young shoots of most members of this genus are very attractive to slugs[K]. Plants adopt a semi-climbing habit, scrambling through small shrubs[187]. Hybridizes with other species in this genus."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in early autumn in a shady part of a cold greenhouse[200]. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible. Germination can be slow, they may not come true to type[200] and it takes a few years for them to reach a good size. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a shady position in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in March or October. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer."
