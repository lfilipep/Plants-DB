It is in flower from May to June, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil. It can tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

It weighs 26lb per cubic foot[235]. It is largely used for fence posts and rails, telegraph poles etc, it is also occasionally used for making furniture, the interior finish of buildings etc. A very valuable timber tree in N. America[1, 11, 61, 82, 171].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a good moist loamy soil and a sunny position that is not exposed[1, 11]. Tolerates heavy clay soils. Very resistant to atmospheric pollution[188]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c, probably more in continental climates[200], they grow best in areas with hot summers[188]. Protect plants from late frosts when they are young[200]. A fast-growing tree in the wild, where it commences to flower when about 15 years old[229]. Flowering is cyclic, with large crops of seed being produced every 2 - 3 years[229]. The wood is weak which often results in branches breaking off in strong winds[229]. When damaged by herbivores, the leaves produce extrafloral nectar that attracts insects which deter the leaf-eating herbivores[274]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Trees transplant easily[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Blooms are very showy.","Seed - best sown outdoors, or in a cold frame, as soon as it is ripe[200]. Stratify stored seed for 3 weeks at 1°c and sow in spring[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings, 10cm long, in a frame. They should be taken in late spring to early summer before the leaves are fully developed[200]. Root cuttings in winter[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
