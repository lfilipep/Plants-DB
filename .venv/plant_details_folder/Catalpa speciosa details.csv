It is largely used for fence posts and rails, telegraph poles etc, it is also occasionally used for making furniture, the interior finish of buildings etc. A very valuable timber tree in N.

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a good moist loamy soil and a sunny position that is not exposed[1, 11]. Tolerates heavy clay soils. Very resistant to atmospheric pollution[188]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c, probably more in continental climates[200], they grow best in areas with hot summers[188]. Protect plants from late frosts when they are young[200]. A fast-growing tree in the wild, where it commences to flower when about 15 years old[229]. Flowering is cyclic, with large crops of seed being produced every 2 - 3 years[229]. The wood is weak which often results in branches breaking off in strong winds[229]. When damaged by herbivores, the leaves produce extrafloral nectar that attracts insects which deter the leaf-eating herbivores[274]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[200]. Trees transplant easily[200]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Naturalizing, Blooms are very showy."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown outdoors, or in a cold frame, as soon as it is ripe[200]. Stratify stored seed for 3 weeks at 1°c and sow in spring[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Softwood cuttings, 10cm long, in a frame. They should be taken in late spring to early summer before the leaves are fully developed[200]. Root cuttings in winter[200]."
