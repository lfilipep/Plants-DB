13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Rosa arkansana is a deciduous Shrub growing to 1.2 m (4ft).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil."

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves."
18,Edible Uses,"Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article."
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[101, 183]. Also used for making syrups, jams and tea[177, 183]. Rich in vitamin C[183]. The fruit is about 15mm in diameter[200], but there is only a thin layer of flesh surrounding the many seeds[K]. Some care has to be taken when eating this fruit, see the notes above on known hazards. Young shoots - peeled and eaten[183]. The flowers, fruits, roots, stem and bark can all be used to make tea[183, 257]. The tea made from the fruit has a sweet flavour[K]. The seed is a good source of vitamin E, it can be ground and mixed with powder or added to other foods as a supplement[102, 183]. Be sure to remove the seed hairs[102]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Haemostatic: Controls internal bleeding.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content"
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Cancer  Haemostatic  Stimulant  Tonic  Vitamin CThe root is haemostatic, stimulant and tonic[257]. A compound decoction of the root has been used in the treatment of bleeding wounds, fits and convulsions[257]. the root has been used in the treatment of eye complaints[257]. The fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214]."
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc."
23,Other Uses Description,The petals have been used as a perfume for hair oil[257].
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[11], preferring a circumneutral soil and a sunny position[200]. Prefers a slightly acid soil[14]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Dislikes water-logged soils[200]. Grows well with alliums, parsley, mignonette and lupins[18, 20]. Garlic planted nearby can help protect the plant from disease and insect predation[18, 20]. Grows badly with boxwood[18]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[80]. Plants produce suckers[200]. Closely related to R. aciculare[1]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed. Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat[80]. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate[80]. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested[80]. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°c[200]. It may take 2 years to germinate[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July in a shaded frame. Overwinter the plants in the frame and plant out in late spring[78]. High percentage[78]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current seasons growth. Select pencil thick shoots in early autumn that are about 20 - 25cm long and plant them in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[78, 200]. The cuttings can take 12 months to establish but a high percentage of them normally succeed[78]. Division of suckers in the dormant season. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Layering. Takes 12 months[11]."
