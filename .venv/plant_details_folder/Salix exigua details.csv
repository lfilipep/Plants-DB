0,Salix exigua,"Coyote Willow, Narrowleaf willow",Salicaceae,Coming soon,None known,"Forms thickets in estuaries and swamps[199]. Sandy gravelly or mucky soils in or along watercourses, often invading fresh sandbars in rivers and streams[229].","N. America - Alaska to New Brunswick, south through central N. America to Texas.",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixExigua.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SalixExigua2.jpg",,"Salix exigua is a deciduous Tree growing to 9 m (29ft 6in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in May, and the seeds ripen in June. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",S. argophylla. Nutt. S. interior. Rowlee.,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.",The leaves have been used to make a drink like orange juice[257].,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Astringent  FebrifugeThe bark has been used in the treatment of sore throats, coughs and certain fevers[257]. A decoction of the dried roots has been used in the treatment of venereal diseases[257]. The fresh bark of all members of this genus contains salicin[226], which probably decomposes into salicylic acid (closely related to aspirin) in the human body[213]. This is used as an anodyne and febrifuge[226].","Baby care: Various plants that can be used in place of items such as nappies.,Basketry: Plant used in making baskets and other items such as chairs. Includes plants that are only used as an ornamental addition.,Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Pioneer: Plants, usually trees and shrubs, that can be used to reforest land.,Soil reclamation: Plants that can be grown in such circumstances an the spoil tips of mines in order to restore fertility.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,String: Plants that can be used for string or can be easily made into a string. See also Fibre. Plants for ropes may be included.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.","The flexible branches are used in basket making[226, 257]. The plant is usually coppiced annually when grown for basket making, though it is possible to coppice it every two years if thick poles are required as uprights. The bark is used to make rope and string[226, 257]. The fibres in the bark have been woven to make clothing, bags and blankets[226, 257]. The shredded inner bark has been used to make sanitary towels and babies' nappies[226]. The twigs have been used as toothbrushes[226]. Plants have an extensive root system, spreading rapidly with long surface roots that produce numerous suckers. They are used in soil stabilization projects[199] and also in reclaiming sandbars etc from rivers[229]. This is a vigorous fast-growing species that paves the way for longer-lived woodland trees. It is intolerant of much shade and is eventually out-competed by the other trees[229].",,"Succeeds in most soils, including wet, ill-drained or intermittently flooded soils[1, 11], but prefers a damp, heavy soil in a sunny position[200]. Rarely thrives on chalk[200]. Plants send out underground stems from which new branches sprout. They quickly form dense thickets[229]. The root system is rather aggressive and can cause problems with drains[200]. It is best not to plant this species within 10 metres of buildings. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Although the flowers are produced in catkins early in the year, they are pollinated by bees and other insects rather than by the wind[11]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.","Seed - must be surface sown as soon as it is ripe in late spring. It has a very short viability, perhaps as little as a few days. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November to February in a sheltered outdoor bed or planted straight into their permanent position and given a good weed-suppressing mulch. Very easy. Plant into their permanent positions in the autumn. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June to August in a frame.
