13,Summary,"Form: Prostrate, Spreading or horizontal.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Juniperus conferta is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.2 m (0ft 8in) by 2 m (6ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",

19,Edible Uses Description,Fruit - raw or cooked[105]. The cones are about 8 - 10mm in diameter[200].,

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,
22,Other Uses,,
23,Other Uses Description,"A good low ground cover[11], though plants take about 2 years to form effective cover[197]. Plants should be spaced about 90cm apart each way[208].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Cascades, Container, Erosion control, Ground cover, Massing, Seashore. Succeeds in hot, dry sandy soils and in maritime exposure[11, 166, 200]. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[1, 11]. Succeeds in poor soils and tolerates light shade[197]. Plants are not reliably hardy in the coldest areas of the country[208]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Not North American native, There are no flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface [2-1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",
