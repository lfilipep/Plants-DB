0,Prunus tomentosa,Nanking Cherry,Rosaceae,3-9,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","Slopes and in ravines, 1700 - 2400 metres in the Himalayas[145]. Forest on mountain slopes, forest margins, thickets and meadows at elevations of 100 - 3700 metres[266].",E. Asia - N. and W.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 2.  It is in flower from March to April, and the seeds ripen in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 105]. Juicy, sub-acid to sweet[22, 46, 61, 183]. The unripe fruits can be pickled[177, 183]. The fruit is about 12mm in diameter and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity. The buds are cooked and eaten[183]. (Is this the flower or leaf buds?)",,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168]. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168]. An excellent windbreak hedgerow. Plants produce suckers freely. A true bush cherry, easy to protect fruit from predating birds. Partially Self-Pollinating/Self-Fertile – will produce better fruit in terms of yields and quantity when planted with other varieties of Nanking Cherries. Flowers: Beautiful pinkish - white fragrant flowers attract a lot of beneficial insects.",,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil, growing well on limestone[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Grows well in partial shade[31], though it fruits better when in a sunny position[11, 200]. Requires a sheltered position[11]. Thrives in hot summers[188]. Cultivated in Asia for its edible fruits, there are some named varieties[58, 183]. The fruits are not freely borne in Britain[11]. The flowers are produced on the previous years growth[182]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The plant is heat tolerant in zones 7 through 1. (Plant Hardiness Zones show how well plants withstand cold winter temperatures. Plant Heat Zones show when plants would start suffering from the heat.  The Plant Heat Zone map is based on the number of ""heat days"" experienced in a given area where the temperature climbs to over 86 degrees F (30°C). At this temperature, many plants begin to suffer physiological damage. Heat Zones range from 1 (no heat days) to 12 (210 or more heat days). For example Heat Zone. 11-1 indicates that the plant is heat tolerant in zones 11 through 1.)  For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is a tap root similar to a carrot going directly down [1-2].","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
