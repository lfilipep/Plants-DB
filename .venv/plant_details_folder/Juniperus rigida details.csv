13,Summary,"Form: Pyramidal, Weeping.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Juniperus rigida is an evergreen Tree growing to 8 m (26ft) by 8 m (26ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Screen, Specimen. Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[11] and succeeding on chalk[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant, succeeding in hot dry positions[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it thrives in S. England[11]. Trees are very slow growing in Britain, normally averaging only 15cm a year increase in height[185]. Cultivated for its wood in Asia[61]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Fragrant foliage, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78].",
