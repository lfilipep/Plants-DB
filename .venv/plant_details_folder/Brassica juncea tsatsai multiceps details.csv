19,Edible Uses Description,"eaves - raw or cooked[ 22 , 33 , 46 , 52 , 61 ]. A peppery flavour that can range from mild to hot, this is one of the most highly prized cooked vegetables in the Orient[ 206 ]. The young raw leaves are pleasantly spicy but older leaves, particularly when the plant runs to seed, can become overpoweringly hot though they are still nice cooked at this stage[ 206 ]. The leaves can be finely shredded and added to mixed salads[ 206 ]. The protein extracted from the leaves mixes well with banana pulp and is well adapted as a pie filling[ 183 ]. Flowers and young flowering stems - raw or cooked[ 52 ]. Sweet and succulent[ 133 ]. An edible semi-drying oil is obtained from the seed[ 1 , 2 , 17 , 57 , 183 ]. The seed contains 25 - 30% oil[ 74 ]. The seed is used as a mustard flavouring[ 171 ]. It is the source of 'brown mustard'[ 183 ], a prepared mustard that is milder than that produced from other species[ 238 ]. Pungency of mustard develops when cold water is added to the ground-up seed - an enzyme (myrosin) acts on a glycoside (sinigrin) to produce a sulphur compound. The reaction takes 10 - 15 minutes. Mixing with hot water or vinegar, or adding salt, inhibits the enzyme and produces a mild bitter mustard[ 238 ]. Black mustard comes from B. nigra and white mustard from Sinapis alba. The seed is also used whole in curries and pickles[ 238 ]. They are often heated in oil to destroy their pungency and give them a nutty flavour[ 238 ]. The root of some forms of this species is edible[ 183 ]. Sprouted seeds can be added to salads.",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Originating from the central Asian Himalayas to China, the plant has long been cultivated and many forms have been developed that can be grown from the temperate to the tropical zones. Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[ 16 , 200 , 206 ]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[ 16 ]. Dislikes very hot weather[ 33 ]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[ 206 ]. A form of B. Juncea that has been selected for its edible leaves, there are many named varieties[ 206 ]. They prefer a fairly high stable temperature and are well adapted to short day length[ 200 ]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[ 269 ]. A good bee plant[ 74 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in situ from June to October. Spring-sown crops tend to run quickly to seed, though they can be eaten whilst still small[ 206 ]. It is best not to sow the seed in very hot weather[ 206 ]. There are about 5,660 - 6,000 per 0.01 kg (1/3 oz)[ 269 ].",
