18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves - raw or cooked[2, 27, 33, 200]. Tender[264]. Most commonly eaten as a vegetable, though the younger and more tender leaves can be added to salads. Some people find the raw leaves hard to digest[K]. The leaves can be available all through the winter[264]. The leaf ribs are cooked like seakale (Crambe maritima.)[27, 33].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[16, 200]. Prefers a heavy soil[16]. Succeeds in any reasonable soil, but is best when grown in a rich soil[33]. Couve tronchuda is a non-hearting form of cabbage with large green leaves and prominent white midribs that are available to eat mainly in the autumn[200]. The plant is transitional between the hearting cabbages and the kales[200]. Occasionally cultivated for its edible leaves and leaf stem, it is taller growing than the cabbages but less hardy, tolerating temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. One report suggests that it might be resistant to club root[33]. A good bee plant[108].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a seedbed outdoors in April. Plant out as space permits in summer. Do not let the seedlings get overcrowded or they will soon become leggy and will not make such good plants. If your seedlings do get leggy, it is possible to plant them rather deeper into the soil - the buried stems will soon form roots and the plant will be better supported.",
