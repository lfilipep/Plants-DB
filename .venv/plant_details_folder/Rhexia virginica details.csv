26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse and only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 10 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold greenhouse or frame for their first winter. Plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.,
