0,Corylus x colurnoides,Trazel,Betulaceae,Coming soon,None known,Not known in the wild.,"A hybrid, C. avellana x C. colurna.",(3 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Corylus_x_colurnoides.JPEG, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/Corylus_x_colurnoides2.JPEG","Corylus x colurnoides, a hybrid of Corylus avellana and Turkish hazel. It has a shrubby habit, but sometimes becomes a tree up to 20m. The bark  tends to be less corky, more fissured and only somewhat peeling on young plants compared to either of the parents. The hybrid is noted for its fine-tasting nuts.","Corylus x colurnoides is a deciduous Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft).  It is in flower from April to May. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",C. intermedia.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[183]. Very tasty[177]. The seed makes an excellent dessert nut, tasting just like the cob and filbert[183, K]. It can also be dried and ground into a powder then used in making nut milks, bread etc[183]. The seed ripens in mid to late autumn and will probably need to be protected from squirrels[K]. When kept in a cool place, and not shelled, the seed should store for at least 12 months[K]. An edible oil is obtained from the seed.",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It does less well in rich heavy soils or poor ones[11, 63]. Does well in a loamy soil[11]. Very suitable for an alkaline soil[11], but it dislikes very acid soils[17]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[1, 11]. A hybrid of garden origin, it combines the non-suckering, winter hardiness and vigorous growth of C. colurna with the free-falling, early bearing and large nut size of C. avellana[183]. There are some named varieties, selected for their edible seeds[183, 200]. Members of this genus bear transplanting well and can be easily moved even when relatively large[11]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a standard with a non-suckering single trunk [1-2].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is harvested in autumn in a cold frame[164]. Germinates in late winter or spring. Stored seed should be pre-soaked in warm water for 48 hours and then given 2 weeks warm followed by 3 - 4 months cold stratification[164]. Germinates in 1 - 6 months at 20°c[164]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame or sheltered place outdoors for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer[K]. This species is a hybrid and will not breed true from seed. Layering in autumn. Easy, it takes about 6 months[78, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
