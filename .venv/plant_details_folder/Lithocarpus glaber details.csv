24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,Prefers a deep fertile soil with medium drainage[200]. Plants are often confused with L. edulis[11]. The botanical name of this species is confusing - glaber means smooth but the young shoots of this species are hairy whilst the young shoots of L. edulis are smooth[11].
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[200]. It needs to be protected from mice, squirrels and other seed eaters. The seed has a short viability but can be stored for a few months if kept cool and slightly damp - the salad compartment of a fridge is a good storage place. Germination takes place in the winter or early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. If the plants are 15cm or more tall by the summer they can be planted out into their permanent positions. Give them a good weed-excluding mulch and some protection from the cold for their first couple of years outdoors. If growth is not sufficient then grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts."
