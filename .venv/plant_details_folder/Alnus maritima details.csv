It is in flower from September to October, and the seeds ripen in May. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. It can fix Nitrogen. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in heavy clay and nutritionally poor soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in saline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy; Secondary;,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Light brown in colour with thick, hardly distinguishable heartwood[82].",,"Landscape Uses:Erosion control, Massing. Prefers a heavy soil and a damp situation, but it succeeds in ordinary garden soil[11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils[11]. Tolerates very infertile sites[200]. Trees are tolerant of frost, poor soil, and some salinity and water-logging[269]. Seaside alder is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 95 to 400cm, an average annual temperature of 13. 5 to 18°C, and a pH in the range of 6. 1 to 8. 1[269]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. Special Features: North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].",Seed -,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
