13,Summary,"Star Apple (Chrysophyllum cainito) is a tropical, slow-growing evergreen tree that is usually about 25 m tall and 4-8 m wide. The stem is erect, the branches hang down, and the leaves are small, dark green in colour but red/yellow underneath, hairy, and shiny. Small flowers occur in clusters. The fruits are oval shaped, purple when ripe, and smooth skinned. The non-climacteric fruit is sweet when ripe and is eaten raw or processed into preserves. Further, ripe fruit sooths inflammation in laryngitis and pneumonia and used as treatment for diabetes, angina, haemorrhage and fever. The leaves are used in the treatment of wounds and hypoglycaemia. The bark, moreover, is used in the treatment for diarrhoea, dysentery, haemorrhages, gonorrhoea, catarrh of the bladder. Branches of star apple tree are used as a medium in growing orchids while the wood pulp is made into high quality paper. The bark yields tannin. The wood is used for general indoor construction and used for fuel.",

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,"Drink: not including plant saps, tea or coffee substitutes.,Milk: made from plants, that is.",
19,Edible Uses Description,"lkFruit - raw or made into preserves[ 301 ]. A sweet flavour[ 301 ]. The pleasantly acidic flesh is high in carbohydrate and is eaten fresh[ 200 ]. The fruit is about 10cm in diameter[ 296 ]. The fruit is not good unless allowed to remain on the tree until fully ripe; if picked when immature it is astringent and contains a sticky, white latex[ 303 ]. The skin needs to be removed since biting into it leaves a horrible stickiness in the mouth[ 296 ]. When opening a star apple fruit, one should not allow any of the bitter latex of the skin to contact the edible fresh[ 306 ]. The ripe fruit, preferably chilled, is cut in half and the flesh spooned out, leaving the seed cells and core. A better way of serving the fruit is to cut around the middle completely through the rind and then, holding the fruit stem-end down, twisting the top gently back and forth. As this is done, the flesh will be felt to free itself from the downward half of the rind, and the latter will pull away, taking with it the greater part of the core[ 306 ]. An emulsion of the slightly bitter seed kernels is used to make imitation milk-of-almonds or nougat and other confections[ 301 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Antiinflammatory: Reduces inflammation of joints, injuries etc.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.,Vermifuge: Expels and kills internal parasites.",

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Antiinflammatory  Astringent  Diuretic  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Pectoral  Stimulant  Tonic  VermifugeThe ripe fruit is eaten to sooth inflammation in laryngitis and pneumonia[ 306 ]. It is given as a treatment for diabetes mellitus, and as a decoction is gargled to relieve angina[ 306 ]. The fruit is used in treating haemorrhage or is cooked and used for fever[ 303 ]. A decoction of the rind, or of the leaves, is taken as a pectoral[ 306 ]. The undersides of the leaves are grated and applied as a poultice to wounds[ 303 ]. A decoction of the leaves is taken orally to treat hypoglycaemia[ 303 ]. A decoction of the tannin-rich, astringent bark is drunk as a tonic and stimulant, and is taken to halt diarrhoea, dysentery and haemorrhages, and as a treatment for gonorrhoea and catarrh of the bladder[ 306 , 348 ]. The bitter, pulverized seed is taken as a tonic, diuretic and febrifuge[ 306 ]. The latex of the tree is applied on abscesses and, when dried and powdered, it is given as a potent vermifuge. It is also taken as a diuretic, febrifuge and remedy for dysentery[ 306 ].",

Other Uses: A good quality paper can be obtained from the wood pulp[ 303 ]. s are extracted from the bark[ 303 ]. The sapwood and heartwood are reddish-brown to dark brown, strong, hard but not durable, with fine to medium texture, fairly straight grain; specific gravity of 0.70[ 303 ]. The wood is used for general indoor construction, such as planking, light framing, flooring, interior trim, lining, shelving, cladding, panelling and partitioning.

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Star apple grows successfully in a range of tropical or near tropical areas. Throughout Southeast Asia it thrives in the lowlands, up to 400 metres elevation, and in areas with a distinct dry season[ 306 ]. If the dry period is most pronounced, undue loss of leaves and less juicy or even shrivelled fruit are evident, which indicates that the drought is too severe and irrigation is needed[ 306 ]. The temperature range for growth is reported to be 12 - 35c with the optimum between 22 - 38c[ 303 ]. Mature trees are seriously injured by temperatures below -2c and recover slowly. Young trees may be killed by even short exposure to -0.5c[ 303 ]. The annual rainfall range for growth is reported to be 800 - 2,200mm with the optimum between 1,000 - 1,400mm[ 303]. Requires a moist, well-drained soil[ 296 ]. Prefers a deep, rich loam[ 200 ]. Fertile, well drained and slightly acid soils are ideal for good growth, though the plant can succeed on almost all types of soil[ 306 ]. Prefers a sunny position[ 307 ]. Established plants are tolerant of drought[ 307 ]. Trees take about 5 - 10 years to produce fruit from seed[ 296 , 377 ]. Grafted plants can start to fruit in 2 - 4 years[ 377 ]. Some trees yield heavy crops of fruit, others bear little[ 303 ]. Yields of 70 kg or fruit per tree per year have been recorded. The fruit do not drop and must be picked. They can be stored for 3 weeks at cool temperatures. Young trees are sensitive to water stress in their first year, and growth during that time is slow. Once the tree is established, growth rate and development become more rapid. Deep mulching with straw or lawn clippings, application of fertilizer and frequent dry-season watering all seem necessary for success with this species[ 303 ]. The trees do not drop their fruit, making it necessary to climb the tree in order to harvest the crop[ 307 ]. There are many named varieties[ 301 ]. Star apple flowers are hermaphrodite, and the plants are usually self-fertile[ 335 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in a light, sandy loam[ 303 ]. Germination rate is 70%, the seed taking up to six weeks to germinate[ 296 , 303 ]. The seed retains its viability for several months[ 306 ]. The seedlings bear fruits in 5-10 years[ 306 ]. Greenwood cuttings. The cuttings taken from mature stems root well[ 306 ], when placed over strong moist heat[ 303 ]. Air layering. Takes 4 - 7 months[ 306 ]. Grafting. Grafted trees have been known to commence bearing in their first year[ 306 ].",
