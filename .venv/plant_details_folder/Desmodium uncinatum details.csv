13,Summary,"Sown in permanent grazing pastures but also used for cut-and-carry, for green or conserved feed, for ground cover and in cropping for intercropping and mulch.  As a carbon farming solutions plant it can be used in agroforestry for nitrogen, as an understory legume."
14,Physical Characteristics,"Desmodium uncinatum is an evergreen Perennial growing to 2 m (6ft) by 0.2 m (0ft 8in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought."

20,Other Uses,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.
21,Other Uses Description,"Grown in association with tussock and more open sward-forming grasses in permanent, semi-intensively managed pastures. Sown in permanent grazing pastures but also used for cut-and-carry, for green or conserved feed, for ground cover and in cropping for intercropping and mulch.  Abundant leaf fall and runner decay provide a deep duff layer under the plants[415]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, understory legume (Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland). : pasture."
22,Cultivation Details,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Agroforestry Services: Understory legume: Legume vegetation, especially the trees and shrubs growing between the forest canopy and the forest floor.,Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Fodder: Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal."
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen  Agroforestry Services: Understory legume  Fodder: Pasture  Management: Fodder  Minor Global CropClimate: tropical. Humidity: humid. Generally grows best on lighter and more friable soils of moderate fertility, but not on heavy clays.  It is more tolerant of low pH , high Al and Mn than ‘Greenleaf’ (D. intortum ) but cannot stand salinity.  More tolerant of poor drainage and high water tables than ‘Greenleaf’. Prefers rainfall exceeding 1,000mm with good distribution throughout the year [415].  Although not productive during the dry season, it will persist in regions with dry seasons of 3 months. It can persist in areas with rainfall as low as 850 mm and as high as 2,400 mm.   With its stronger taproot , D. uncinatum proved decidedly more drought tolerant than D. intortum .  It will grow in wet soils and tolerate short term flooding. It is a warm season plant but with good tolerance of cooler conditions.  Peaks of growth occur in spring and autumn with a slight depression in the heat of mid-summer.  Generally grown at moderate altitudes (to 2,000 m) in the tropics and lower altitudes in the subtropics.  It is one of the most cool-tolerant tropical legumes although leaves are damaged or killed by frost. It is moderately tolerant of shaded conditions [415]. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: minor global crop. Management: fodder (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1]."
24,Plant Propagation,Seed germinates quickly (3-4 days) without scarification.
