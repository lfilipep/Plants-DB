See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",Desmodium uncinatum var. gracile Burkart. Desmodium uncinatum var. uncinatum. Hedysarum uncinatum Jacq. Meibomia uncinata (Jacq.)

Humidity: humid. Generally grows best on lighter and more friable soils of moderate fertility, but not on heavy clays.  It is more tolerant of low pH , high Al and Mn than ‘Greenleaf’ (D. intortum ) but cannot stand salinity.  More tolerant of poor drainage and high water tables than ‘Greenleaf’. Prefers rainfall exceeding 1,000mm with good distribution throughout the year [415].  Although not productive during the dry season, it will persist in regions with dry seasons of 3 months. It can persist in areas with rainfall as low as 850 mm and as high as 2,400 mm.   With its stronger taproot , D. uncinatum proved decidedly more drought tolerant than D. intortum .  It will grow in wet soils and tolerate short term flooding. It is a warm season plant but with good tolerance of cooler conditions.  Peaks of growth occur in spring and autumn with a slight depression in the heat of mid-summer.  Generally grown at moderate altitudes (to 2,000 m) in the tropics and lower altitudes in the subtropics.  It is one of the most cool-tolerant tropical legumes although leaves are damaged or killed by frost. It is moderately tolerant of shaded conditions [415].
