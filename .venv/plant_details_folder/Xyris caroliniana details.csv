22,Cultivation Details,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors at least in the milder areas of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in damp borders and the bog garden, requiring a moist humus-rich soil in sun or semi-shade[200]."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no information for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse as soon as it if possible, otherwise in early spring. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division as plants come into growth in the spring."
