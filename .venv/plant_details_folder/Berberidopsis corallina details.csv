17,Edible Parts,
18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Fodder: Pod: Fodder plants with pods.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a deep, moist, humus-rich soil and a position where it is sheltered from drying winds and strong sunlight[11, 200]. This species will tolerate a slightly alkaline soil if peat or some other acid medium is added, but it is not really suited to chalky soils[11]. This species is not very hardy outdoors in Britain[11], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c so long as this is not for prolonged periods[200]. It succeeds in the more westerly areas of the country, but in general needs the protection of a wall and will succeed on a south-facing wall so long as it is protected from winds from that quarter[11]. If the top-growth is cut back by winter cold, the plant can re-sprout from the rootstock[200]. A climbing plant, growing up through trees and shrubs and supporting itself by twining around them[200]. The plant usually forms fruit in Britain, but the seed is seldom fertile[11]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a warm greenhouse in early spring. The seed can take 12 months or more to germinate and there is usually a poor germination rate[247]. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots. Grow them on a shady part of the greenhouse for at least their first winter and then plant them out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frost. Consider giving the plant some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Layering."
