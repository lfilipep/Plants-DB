24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most fertile soils[182]. Easily grown in a good well-drained loamy soil in a sunny position[1, 11, 200]. This species is not very hardy in Britain[1], it succeeds outdoors only in the mildest areas of the country and even there it requires the protection of a warm sunny wall[11]. A vigorous grower, it can easily swamp nearby plants[219]. Plants are sometimes erroneously labelled as R. australis[219]. The adult and juvenile forms of this plant are quite distinct from each other[11]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200]."
