Root Type: Rhizome. Seasonal Interest: Summer-Fall. Notes: Spreads via rhizome, forms a dense clump. Seeds resemble ticks, hence the name. Cultivars available. The following notable cultivars have all gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: 'Grandiflora' - taller than other cultivars, with slightly larger flowers. 'Moonbeam' - pale, sulphur-yellow flowers, slightly shorter growth. 'Zagreb' - shorter than the species, bright yellow flowers. Flower Color: Yellow. Drought: Tolerant. Flood: Sensitive.

Tends to sprawl, particularly if grown in moist and/or fertile soils. Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils. Plants may be sheared in mid to late summer to promote a fall rebloom and to remove any sprawling or unkempt foliage. Species plants can spread somewhat aggressively in the garden by both rhizomes and self-seeding [368-1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",Propagation is by seed or division of the rhizomes.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
