21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.DiureticDiuretic [318-1].,
22,Other Uses,"Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Groundcover. A good medium to high density fast growing groundcover [1-2]. Erosion Control. Ornamental: Good in flower beds, borders, mass plantings, entrace ways, foundations, raised planters, and naturalized sunny areas. A good plant for areas with poor, dry soils. Container Garden. Cut Flower. Insectory:Long flowering period attracts butterflies. [318-1].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A hardy herbaceous rhizomatous perennial. It can tolerate drought, poor soil, extreme heat, and neglect. Life Span: Short-Lived Perennial. Stand Persistence: Long. Form: Clump. Texture: Fine. Sun: Full Sun. Soil Type: Sandy, Loamy, Silty. Soil Moisture: Moderate, Dry. Soil pH: 6.5 - 7.5. Root Type: Rhizome. Seasonal Interest: Summer-Fall. Notes: Spreads via rhizome, forms a dense clump. Seeds resemble ticks, hence the name. Cultivars available. The following notable cultivars have all gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: 'Grandiflora' - taller than other cultivars, with slightly larger flowers. 'Moonbeam' - pale, sulphur-yellow flowers, slightly shorter growth. 'Zagreb' - shorter than the species, bright yellow flowers. Flower Color: Yellow. Drought: Tolerant. Flood: Sensitive. Cold Injury: Infrequent. Wind Storm Damage: Infrequent. Disease Issues: Minor. Insect/Pest Damage: Minor. Animal Damage: Deer. Bloom Time: Summer - Late Fall. Fruit Time: Summer - Fall [318-1]. Tends to sprawl, particularly if grown in moist and/or fertile soils. Crown rot may occur if grown in moist, poorly drained soils. Plants may be sheared in mid to late summer to promote a fall rebloom and to remove any sprawling or unkempt foliage. Species plants can spread somewhat aggressively in the garden by both rhizomes and self-seeding [368-1]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a clumper with limited spread [1-2]. The root pattern is fibrous dividing into a large number of fine roots [1-2]. The root pattern is stoloniferous rooting from creeping stems above the ground [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,Propagation is by seed or division of the rhizomes.,
