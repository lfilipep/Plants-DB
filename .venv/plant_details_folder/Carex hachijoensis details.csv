In full sun and hot sites foliage tends to bleach to an unattractive yellow. Tolerates: Deer, Heavy Shade, Erosion, Wet Soil. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is clumping, giving the plant a 'clumping' habit. The predictable growth behaviour makes it easier to maintain without having to apply containment methods[2-1]."
