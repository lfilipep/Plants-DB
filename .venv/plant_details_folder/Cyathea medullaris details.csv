0,Cyathea medullaris,Black Tree Fern,Cyatheaceae,8-11,"Although we have found no reports of toxicity for this species, a number of ferns contain carcinogens so some caution is advisable[200]. Many ferns also contain thiaminase, an enzyme that robs the body of its vitamin B complex. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172].","Lowland forests in North, South and Stewart Islands of New Zealand[44].","Australia, New Zealand.",(2 of 5),(0 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Half Hardy,Moist Soil,Wet Soil,Semi-shade","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CyatheaMedullaris.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/CyatheaMedullaris2.gif",,"Cyathea medullaris is an evergreen Fern growing to 9 m (29ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Bog Garden;,"Leaves: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",,"Pith of stem - raw or cooked[46, 61, 154, 173, 193]. Rich in starch, the portion below the growing point is the part used[193], do not confuse this with the trunk of the plant, which is made up of a peaty substance from the decaying roots[K]. The pith is used as a coarse sago substitute[2]. The pith contains (dry weight) 3.6% protein, 7.4% starch, 3.1% lipids and 3% simple reducing sugars[173]. The stem is often damaged some time prior to harvest in order to improve the flavour of the pith, a slimy red bitter gum exudes from the wound[173]. Harvesting the stem kills the plant and so cannot normally be condoned[193]. Base of the frond stems - cooked. Young new croziers - cooked[173]. Harvested just before they unfurl, they are juicy and slimy, tasting somewhat like bitter celery[193].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Prefers a humus-rich soil in a sheltered light position but with shade from strong sun It grows well in light woodland. Requires shelter from winds, an abundance of moisture at its roots and its trunk kept wet[1, 49, 200]. A very ornamental plant, it succeeds outdoors in woodland conditions in the mildest parts of the country, but is tender in most parts of Britain[49]. It can bet grown in pots in a shady position in a conservatory or cool greenhouse and placed outside in the summer[1]. It can grow well in very small pots[1]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].",Spores - can be surface sown at any time of the year in a light position in a warm greenhouse[164]. Keep moist by standing the pot in shallow water or by enclosing it in a plastic bag. Germinates in 1 - 3 months at 25°c. Prick out patches of the young plants into small pots and stand the pots in shallow water until the plants are well established[164]. Grow on in a shady position in a greenhouse for at least the first two winters and plant out in late spring.,If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
