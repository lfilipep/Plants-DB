The trunk is usually straight, cylindrical, and slightly buttressed. It is a fast-growing tree commonly found in East tropical Africa. Traditionally, it is used against stomach pain, infertility in women, fever, colds, cancer, stomach ulcers, appendicitis, and diarrhea. Further, it exhibits antibacterial and antifungal properties. No plant part is edible. The wood is moderately heavy, moderately durable, and susceptible to termite attack. It is used for poles, stools, mortars, tool handles, construction, flooring, shipbuilding, furniture, toys, veneer, plywood, etc. It is also used for fuel and charcoal.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Terminalia sambesiaca is an evergreen Tree growing to 32 m (105ft) by 32 m (105ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade.

17,Edible Parts,,
18,Edible Uses,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.",
19,Edible Uses Description,,
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Antifungal: An agent that inhibits or destroys fungi. Used in the treatment of various fungal problems such as candida.,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antidiarrhoeal  Antifungal  Cancer  FebrifugeIn traditional medicine the leaves are used to treat stomach-ache and infertility in women, whereas bark and leaf decoctions are applied to treat fever, colds, cancer, stomach ulcers and appendicitis. Powdered root bark is mixed with porridge and eaten to treat bloody diarrhoea[299 , 364 ]. Methanol extracts of the roots showed marked antibacterial activity against Enterobacter aerogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina sp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella boydii, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as distinct antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Cryptococcus neoformans. Bark extracts also showed antibacterial activity and leaf extracts antifungal properties against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Antifungal activity was found especially in polar fractions of the extract and might be due to the presence of tannins. Root extracts showed strong cytotoxic effects against several human cancer cell lines, e.g. Against HeLa cervical cancer cells, T24 bladder cancer cells and BBCE endothelial cells[299 ].",
22,Other Uses,"Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Other Uses: The heartwood is yellow with brownish stripes on quarter-sawn surfaces, darkening rapidly to yellowish brown or greenish brown; it is distinctly demarcated from the up to 6cm wide band of cream-coloured sapwood. The grain is interlocked; the texture fine and even. The wood is moderately heavy, moderately durable, being susceptible to termite attack. It seasons fairly rapidly, with little degrade, though surface checking and some distortion may occur, especially in kiln drying; once dry, the wood is moderately stable in service. It is moderately difficult to saw and work with hand and machine tools; it often finishes well, but the use of a filler has been recommended to produce good surfaces; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring. The wood is used for building poles, ship masts, stools, mortars, tool handles and beehives. It is suitable for construction, flooring, joinery, interior trim, bridge decking, ship building, furniture, cabinet work, sporting goods, toys, novelties, railway sleepers, mine props, veneer and plywood[299 , 364 ]. The wood is used for fuel and for charcoal production[299 , 364 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"The tree is said to grow rapidly[299 ]. The flowers have a strong and unpleasant smell, and are probably pollinated by flies[299 ]. Although this species has been reported to be an excellent timber tree, very little is known about its growth rates, propagation and possibilities for establishing plantations[299 ].",
