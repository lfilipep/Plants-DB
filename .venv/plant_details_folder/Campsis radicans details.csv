22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Arbor, Seashore, Woodland garden. Succeeds on a warm wall in a good loamy soil[1] in full sun[166] or light shade[200]. Plants can become rampant when growing in rich soils[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -20°c according to some reports[184, 200] whilst another says that it is not hardy in all parts of the country but it succeeds in more open positions such as a pergola or an old tree in the southern part of England[1]. Plants require the extra warmth of a sunny wall to induce better flowering[184]. Plants are self-clinging by aerial roots like ivy but are best if given some support[1, 166]. Any pruning is best done in the spring[188]. The seed only ripens outdoors in Britain in hot summers[11]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[202]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Special Features:Attracts birds, North American native, Invasive, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Attracts butterflies, Attractive flowers or blooms.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse at 10°c. Two months stratification at 5°c assists germination[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of almost ripe wood, 7 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame. Slow to root but a fair percentage[78, 200]. Root cuttings 5cm long in December. Fair to good percentage[78]. Suckers, removed in the dormant season.",
