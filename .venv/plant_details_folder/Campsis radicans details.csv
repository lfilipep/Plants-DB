Plants require the extra warmth of a sunny wall to induce better flowering[184]. Plants are self-clinging by aerial roots like ivy but are best if given some support[1, 166]. Any pruning is best done in the spring[188]. The seed only ripens outdoors in Britain in hot summers[11]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[202].
