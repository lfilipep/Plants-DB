Very resistant to maritime exposure and salt spray[166]. This species is not very hardy in mainland Britain, it succeeds outdoors on the Scilly Isles[1] but usually requires greenhouse protection elsewhere[1]. Plants flower freely in Cornish gardens[1, 59]. Plants do not tolerate temperatures below 0°c[166]. The leaves emit a resinous smell when bruised[245]. The flowers are also fragrant[245]. Special Features: Not North American native, Invasive, Attractive flowers or blooms. Myoporum thrips or naio thrips (Klambothrips myopori) have been documented from California, Hawaii and Tasmania were they are linked to extensive damage of landscape and nursery stock of Myoporum laetum. Many thrips species are pests of commercially important crops. Thrips have caused high levels of mortality in ornamental Myoporum species used for landscaping in residential areas, parks and along road margins. In Hawaii it is attacking the native Myoporum sandwicense, locally known as naio."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Consider giving the plants some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Pot up in the autumn. Good percentage[78]."
