Myoporum thrips or naio thrips (Klambothrips myopori) have been documented from California, Hawaii and Tasmania were they are linked to extensive damage of landscape and nursery stock of Myoporum laetum.

Thrips have caused high levels of mortality in ornamental Myoporum species used for landscaping in residential areas, parks and along road margins. In Hawaii it is attacking the native Myoporum sandwicense, locally known as naio.","Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse.
