18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Root - must be well cooked[183]. The raw root should not be eaten[K]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Flower buds - raw, cooked or pickled and used as a caper substitute[142, 183]. Eating the raw flower buds can lead to intoxication[222]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Young leaves - raw or cooked[2, 46, 55, 62, 161]. The leaves are harvested in the spring as the plant is coming into flower and is used like spinach after cooking in two or more changes of water[2, 183]. Eating the raw leaves can lead to intoxication[222]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity. Older leaves, before the plant flowers, can be eaten if they are well cooked[172]. Some caution is advised, see the notes above on toxicity."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Anodyne: Relieves pain, it is milder than an analgesic.,Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Irritant: Causes irritation or abnormal sensitivity in living tissue.,Rubefacient: A counter-irritant and external stimulant, it produces inflammation and redness of the skin.,Warts: Used in the treatment of warts, corns etc."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anodyne  Antirheumatic  Antispasmodic  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Irritant  Rubefacient  WartsEvery part of this plant is strongly irritant and so it should be used with caution[4]. The whole plant is anodyne, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant and rubefacient[21, 172]. It has been used to remove warts and is also used in the treatment of fits and anaemia[4, 21, 172]. The root is antirheumatic, diaphoretic, emetic and expectorant[218, 222]. A decoction is used in the treatment of colds[257]. A poultice of the boiled and mashed roots has been applied to sores[257]. A tea made from the leaves is diuretic and laxative[222, 257]. All parts of the plant can irritate or blister the skin or mucous membranes[222]."
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.
23,Other Uses Description,"A yellow dye is obtained from the flowers[[100, 115], a saffron substitute[142]. It is used as a dye when mixed with alum, though it is not very permanent[4]. Plants can be grown for ground cover when planted about 45cm apart each way[208]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A plant of the waterside, it prefers growing in a sunny position in wet soils or shallow water up to 15cm deep[1, 111, 233], though it will tolerate drier conditions if there is shade from the summer sun[233]. Another report says that it grows best in partial shade[17]. Requires a deep rich slightly alkaline soil[31, 111]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Prefers a chalky soil[31]. Tolerates a pH in the range 4.8 to 7.5. A very ornamental[1] and polymorphic plant[17], there are some named varieties[233]. Plants often self-sow when well sited[208]. A good bee plant[24]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. This species is probably the most primitive flower in the British flora[17]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame in late summer[200]. Stand the pots in 2 - 3cm of water to keep the soil wet. The seed usually germinates in 1 - 3 months at 15°c[138]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a tray of water in a cold frame until they are at least 15cm tall. Plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer. Division in early spring or autumn[200]. Very easy, larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring."
