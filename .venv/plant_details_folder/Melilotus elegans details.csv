4,Known Hazards,"Although no reports have been seen for this species, the dried leaves of some members of this genus can be toxic though the fresh leaves are quite safe[76]. (This is possibly due to the presence of coumarin, the substance that gives some dried plants the smell of new mown hay. If taken internally it can prevent the blood from clotting.)"

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and cannot be sure that it will succeed outdoors in Britain, but assume that it can be grown as a spring-sown annual. Dislikes shade. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. When removing plant remains at the end of the growing season, it is best to only remove the aerial parts of the plant, leaving the roots in the ground to decay and release their nitrogen."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring to mid-summer in situ[87]. Pre-soaking the seed for 12 hours in warm water will speed up the germination process, particularly in dry weather[K]. Germination will usually take place within 2 weeks."
