13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Elaeagnus orientalis is a deciduous Shrub growing to 12 m (39ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure."

17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans."
18,Edible Uses,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[3, 105]. Sweet and mealy but of better quality than the closely related E. angustifolia[183]. Eaten fresh or made into sherbet and preserves. The fruit must be fully ripe before it can be enjoyed raw, if even slightly under-ripe it will be quite astringent[K]. The oval fruit is about 10mm long and contains a single large seed[K]. Seed - raw or cooked. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous[K]."
20,Medicinal Uses,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerThe fruit of many members of this genus is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers[214]."
22,Other Uses,"Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges."
23,Other Uses Description,"Plants can be grown as a hedge in exposed positions, tolerating maritime exposure."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils that are well-drained[11, 200]. Prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in very poor soils and in dry soils[11, 200]. Established plants are very drought resistant[1]. Prefers a light sandy loam and a sunny position[11, 200]. Dislikes shallow chalk soils[98]. Very closely related to E. angustifolia and often considered to be no more than a sub-species of it[183], it does not flower so freely in Britain as that species[11]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[88, 200]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200]. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%. The flowers are very fragrant and are rich in nectar[183], they are much visited by bees. Occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties[183]. The fruit used to be commonly sold in the markets of Iran and Turkey but is rarely found there nowadays[183]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help[98]. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, October/November in a frame[200]. The cuttings are rather slow and difficult to root, leave them for 12 months[113]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78]."
