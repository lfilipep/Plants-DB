0,Mahonia pumila,Dwarf Barberry,Berberidaceae,6-9,None known,Mountains[11]. Open woods and rocky areas at elevations of 300 - 1200 metres[270].,South-western N. America - California and southern Oregon.,(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Well drained soil,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaPumila.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MahoniaPumila2.jpg",,"Mahonia pumila is an evergreen Shrub growing to 0.3 m (1ft) by 2 m (6ft 7in) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Berberis pumila,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; Ground Cover;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked. We have seen no reports of edibility for this species, but it is certainly not poisonous. The fruit is likely to have an acid flavour and be suitable for making jams. jellies etc. The fruit is about 10mm in diameter[200].","Antibacterial: Kills bacteria.,Antitumor: Preventing, or effective against, tumors, it is used in the treatment of cancer. Probably synonymous with Cytotoxic.,Blood tonic: Is this any different to a blood purifier?,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antibacterial  Antitumor  Blood tonic  Dysentery  TonicA decoction of the roots is used as a blood tonic and as a treatment for coughs[257]. Berberine, universally present in rhizomes of Mahonia species, has marked antibacterial effects[218] and is used as a bitter tonic[213]. Since it is not appreciably absorbed by the body, it is used orally in the treatment of various enteric infections, especially bacterial dysentery[218]. It should not be used with Glycyrrhiza species (Liquorice) because this nullifies the effects of the berberine[218]. Berberine has also shown antitumour activity[218]. The root and root bark are best harvested in the autumn[213].",Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,"A yellow dye is obtained from the inner bark of the stem and roots[155, 257]. It is green[168]. Dark green, violet and dark blue-purple dyes are obtained from the fruit[168]. A green dye is obtained from the leaves[168]. This species forms suckers freely and should make a good dense ground cover in a sunny position[11].",,"An easily grown plant, it thrives in any good well-drained garden soil[11], preferring one on the dryish side. Prefers a sunny position[11], but also succeeds in the light shade of trees[K]. This species is hardy to about -15°c if growing in a sheltered position[184]. Established plants sucker freely and form quite dense thickets[200]. Resistant to honey fungus[88].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[78]. It usually germinates in the spring[K]. 'Green' seed (harvested when the embryo has fully developed but before the seed case has dried) should be sown as soon as it is harvested and germinates within 6 weeks[K]. Stored seed should be sown as soon as possible in late winter or spring. 3 weeks cold stratification will improve its germination, which should take place in 3 - 6 months at 10°c. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Division of suckers in spring[78]. Whilst they can be placed direct into their permanent positions, better results are achieved if they are potted up and placed in a frame until established[11].
