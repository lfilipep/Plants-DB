Plants are best grown in the shade, their leaves curling up when in strong sunlight[200]. Dislikes drought[1]. A slow growing plant, it prefers a position sheltered from cold north and east winds[11]. This species is particularly sensitive to cold winds[162]. Most leaves are produced at the tops of the stems. A very ornamental and hardy bamboo, tolerating temperatures down to about -25°c[1, 200]. The plant has a running rootstock but it only spreads slowly in the British climate and never becomes invasive. New shoots are produced from late May[25]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122].","Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out, which could take 2 - 3 years. The plants only flower at intervals of several years and so seed is rarely available. Division as the plants come into growth in spring. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings.
