Seed[172]. No further details are given but the seeds of other members of this genus are parched and then eaten. An essential oil from the leaves and root is used as a flavouring in ice cream, baked goods, condiments etc[183]. The leaves can also be used as a condiment[61]. The plant is used in moderation as a herbal tea[183].","Antispasmodic: Relaxes muscular spasms and cramps, calming nervous irritation.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Hypnotic: Induces sleep.,Nervine: Stimulates and calms the nerves.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antispasmodic  Carminative  Diuretic  Eczema  Hypnotic  Nervine  Sedative  StimulantValerian is a well-known and frequently used medicinal herb that has a long and proven history of efficacy. It is noted especially for its effect as a tranquilliser and nervine, particularly for those people suffering from nervous overstrain[4, 222]. Valerian has been shown to encourage sleep, improve sleep quality and reduce blood pressure[254]. It is also used internally in the treatment of painful menstruation, cramps, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome etc[238, 254]. It should not be prescribed for patients with liver problems[238]. Externally, it is used to treat eczema, ulcers and minor injuries[238]. The root is antispasmodic, carminative, diuretic, hypnotic, powerfully nervine, sedative and stimulant[4, 7, 9, 14, 21, 46, 147, 165, 192, 218]. The active ingredients are called valepotriates, research has confirmed that these have a calming effect on agitated people, but are also a stimulant in cases of fatigue[222]. The roots of 2 year old plants are harvested in the autumn once the leaves have died down and are used fresh or dried[4, 9, 238]. The fresh root is about 3 times as effective as roots dried at 40° (the report does not specify if this is centigrade or fahrenheit), whilst temperatures above 82° destroy the active principle in the root[240]. Use with caution[21, 238], see the notes above on toxicity.","Compost: Plants used for activating compost heaps, providing biomass for composting, using as instant compost etc.,Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Liquid feed: Plants that can be used to make a liquid fertilizer.,Repellent: Plants that are said to deter but not necessarily kill various mammals, birds, insects etc.","The plant yields about 1% of an essential oil from the roots[7, 238]. It is used in perfumery to provide a 'mossy' aroma[57, 61, 238], though the scent is considered to be disagreeable by many people[207]. The dried roots are also placed in linen cupboards and clothes drawers in order to scent the clothes[4]. The dried root attracts rats and cats, it can be used as a bait to lure them away from other areas[100]. An ingredient of 'QR' herbal compost activator[32]. This is a dried and powdered mixture of several herbs that can be added to a compost heap in order to speed up bacterial activity and thus shorten the time needed to make the compost[K]. The plant can also be used to make a very good liquid plant feed[14, 18, 201]. It attracts earthworms[14, 18]. The leaves are very rich in phosphorus[201].",,"Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1], preferring a moist site[7, 17]. Succeeds in full sun or in partial shade[233]. This species is considered to be no more than a sub-species of V. officinalis by many botanists[200], it has the same uses as that species[4]. Often grown in the herb garden and also sometimes grown commercially as a medicinal herb[1, 200]. Cats are very fond of this plant, particularly the powdered root[1, 4, 20]. The root also attracts rats[14]. A good companion for most plants.","Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed because it requires light for germination[200]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant out into their permanent positions in the summer if sufficient growth has been made. If the plants are too small to plant out, grow them on in the greenhouse or frame for their first winter and plant them out early in the following summer. Division in spring. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
