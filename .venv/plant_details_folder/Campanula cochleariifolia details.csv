See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies, beetles, Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",C. bellardii. C. pumila. C. pusilla.,Cultivated Beds; East Wall. In. South Wall. In. West Wall. In.,"Flowers: ,Leaves: ",,Leaves - raw or cooked.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"A very easily grown plant that succeeds in most situations so long as they are not both hot and dry[221]. In nature, the plant is found in poor soils and rock crevices and, in cultivation, when introduced to the richer conditions of the garden, is apt to spread by means of seeds and a creeping rhizome - indeed some gardeners consider it a pest even though it is beautiful and long-flowering[271]. It is probably best grown in a poor soil, indeed it grows happily in pure gravel and sand[271]. It succeeds on drystone walls where it can become invasive[200]. It does especially well on the top of walls where there are cracks for it to root into[219]. Prefers a moist but well-drained sandy loam and a neutral or alkaline soil in sun or partial shade[1, 200]. Plants are hardy to at least -15°c[200]. The species in this genus do not often hybridize and so seed can generally be relied upon to come true[221]. The plants are self-fertile and often self-sow in the garden[221, 271]. There are several named varieties selected for their ornamental value[200]. 'Elizabeth Oliver' has pleasantly flavoured leaves[K]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233].","Seed - surface sow spring in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates in 2 - 4 weeks at 18°c. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Basal cuttings in spring. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10 - 15cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy[221], larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer or following spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
