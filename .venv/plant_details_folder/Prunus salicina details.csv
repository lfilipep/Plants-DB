4,Known Hazards,"Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.",

13,Summary,"Bloom Color: Red, White. Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded.",
14,Physical Characteristics,"Prunus salicina is a deciduous Tree growing to 4 m (13ft) by 3 m (9ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6.  It is in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from July to August. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked[46, 61, 105, 171]. The fruit ripens early[74]. A unique taste[74]. Sweet and juicy, it can be eaten out of hand, made into pies, preserves etc, or be dried for later use[183]. The fruit is very resistant to rotting[74]. The plum-shaped fruit is up to 7cm long and contains one large seed[200]. Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.",
20,Medicinal Uses,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.StomachicThe fruit is stomachic[240]. It is said to be good for allaying thirst and is given in the treatment of arthritis[240]. Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being[238].",
22,Other Uses,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,
23,Other Uses Description,"A green dye can be obtained from the leaves[168].A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit[168].Wild populations of this species are primary genetic relatives of the cultivated Japanese Plum (Prunus salicina) and they also belong to the secondary Gene Pool of the Apricot (Prunus armeniaca), Myrobalan Plum (Prunus cerasifera) and Peach (Prunus persica). As a result, this species has the potential for use as a gene donor for crop improvement[338]. Espalier: tree or other plant that is trained to grow flat against a support (such as a trellis or wall).",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil[11, 200]. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present[1]. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position[11, 200]. This species does not grow well in Britain, the summers are not warm enough to properly ripen the wood and the springs are too unpredictable for the flowers to be fertilized[11]. An important temperate fruit tree, it is widely cultivated in China and other regions of Asia for its edible fruit, and is being increasingly grown in N. America[266]. There are several named varieties[46, 58, 183]. This species does not cross-pollinate with the English plum, P. domestica[200]. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged[238]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:Not North American native, All or parts of this plant are poisonous, Blooms are very showy. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. A sprouting standard sending up shoots from the base [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe[200]. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible[200]. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame[11, 200]. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame[200]. Layering in spring.",
