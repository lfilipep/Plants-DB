18,Edible Uses,Gum: can be chewed as a chewing gum or can often be used as a sweetener or thickening agent in foods.
19,Edible Uses Description,"A chewing gum and a stabilizer for cakes etc is obtained from the resin[102, 105, 149, 159]. It can also be chewed to sweeten the breath[183]."
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antiseptic: Preventing sepsis, decay or putrefaction, it destroys or arrests the growth of micro-organisms.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Cholera: Used in the treatment of cholera - an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with Vibrio cholerae bacteria.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Expectorant: Clears phlegm from the chest by inducing coughing.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Poultice: A moist, usually warm or hot, mass of plant material applied to the skin in the treatment of burns etc.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Sedative: Gently calms, reducing nervousness, distress and irritation.,Stimulant: Excites or quickens activity of the physiological processes. Faster acting than a tonic but differing from a narcotic in that it does not give a false sense of well-being.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds."
21,Medicinal Uses Description,"Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antiseptic  Astringent  Carminative  Cholera  Diuretic  Dysentery  Expectorant  Parasiticide  Poultice  Salve  Sedative  Stimulant  VulneraryA resin obtained from the trunk of the tree (see 'Uses notes' below) is antiseptic, carminative, diuretic, expectorant, parasiticide, poultice, salve, sedative, stimulant, vulnerary[21, 46, 57, 61, 149, 171, 213, 218, 222, 238]. It is chewed in the treatment of sore throats, coughs, asthma, cystitis, dysentery etc[222, 238, 257]. Externally, it is applied to sores, wounds, piles, ringworm, scabies etc[222, 238]. The resin is an ingredient of 'Friar's Balsam', a commercial preparation based on Styrax benzoin that is used to treat colds and skin problems[238]. The mildly astringent inner bark is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and childhood cholera[222]."
22,Other Uses,"Adhesive: Glues.,Gum: Gums have a wide range of uses, especially as stabilizers, emulsifiers, thickening agents, adhesives etc.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Resin: Used in perfumery, medicines, paints, soap making etc. This also includes turpentine, which is extracted from many resins and used as a preservative, water proofer etc,,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood."
23,Other Uses Description,"The aromatic resin 'Storax' is obtained from the trunk of this tree[46, 57, 61, 64]. It forms in cavities of the bark and also exudes naturally. It is harvested in autumn[181, 238]. Production can be stimulated by beating the trunk in the spring[171, 238]. The resin has a wide range of uses including medicinal, incense, perfumery, soap and as an adhesive[149]. It is also chewed and used as a tooth cleaner[183].  - heavy, fairly hard, fine-grained, not strong, light, tough, resilient. It weighs about 37lb per cubic foot[227]. The wood takes a high polish and can be stained then used as a cherry, mahogany or walnut substitute[171]. It is also used for furniture, flooring, fruit dishes, veneer etc[46, 61, 82, 149, 227]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Aggressive surface roots possible, Specimen, Street tree. Prefers a moist but not swampy loam in a sunny sheltered position[11, 200]. Succeeds in light shade[188]. Prefers a neutral to acid soil[130]. Plants grow poorly in shallow soils overlying chalk[188]. Young plants are susceptible to damage from late frosts. A highly ornamental plant, especially in its autumn foliage[1, 227], it grows well in Cornwall[59] and S. England but does not do well in the north[98]. A fast-growing and long lived tree, it is fairly free from pests and diseases and has the potential to be a re-afforestation tree in cutover lands[227]. Trees commence flowering when about 20 - 25 years old[229]. The leaves emit a balsam-like fragrance when they fall in the autumn, this is retained until the leaves are quite withered[245]. Plants in the north of their range do not produce much resin[183]. Resists honey fungus[88]. This species resents root disturbance, young plants should be pot-grown and be placed in their permanent positions as soon as possible[200]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Invasive, Naturalizing, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots spreading near the soil surface [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Harvest the seed capsules at the end of October or November, dry in a warm place and extract the seed by shaking the capsule. Stored seed requires 1 - 3 months stratification and sometimes takes 2 years to germinate. Sow it as early in the year as possible. Germination rates are often poor. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame or greenhouse for their first winter. Since they resent root disturbance, it is best to plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer of their second year and give them some protection from cold for their first winter outdoors[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Suckers in early spring. Layering in October/November. Takes 12 months."
