24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily cultivated in any reasonably good soil[1, 200]. Prefers a deep moist well-drained loam[4, 11]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Tolerates full shade but requires a sunny position for best fruit production[3, 11, 200]. Becomes chlorotic on very alkaline soils[188, 200]. Tolerates atmospheric pollution[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is hardy to about -25°c[200]. Plants are subject to canker, especially when growing in the milder moister areas of Britain[49]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Fruits are usually freely produced in Britain, but they do not always ripen[11, 182]. The plant grows and fruits well on a south wall at Kew[K]. A good bee plant, flowering early in the year and providing pollen and nectar[108]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a sheltered position outdoors or in a cold frame[200]. Sow stored seed in February in a greenhouse[78]. Germination usually takes place within 6 weeks[78]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle. If well grown, these seedling can be large enough to plant out in the summer, but give them some protection in their first winter. Otherwise plant them out in late spring of the following year[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, November in a cold frame. Layering in late spring or in autumn. This is a sure and easy method, though it takes 12 months[78, 200]."
