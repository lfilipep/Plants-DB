0,Saponaria officinalis,"Soapwort, Bouncingbet",Caryophyllaceae,4-8,"The plant contains saponins[13]. Although toxic, these substances are very poorly absorbed by the body and so tend to pass through without causing harm. They are also broken down by thorough cooking. Saponins are found in many plants, including several that are often used for food, such as certain beans. It is advisable not to eat large quantities of food that contain saponins. Saponins are much more toxic to some creatures, such as fish, and hunting tribes have traditionally put large quantities of them in streams, lakes etc in order to stupefy or kill the fish[K]. Do not use for more than 2 weeks. Avoid during pregnancy.","Fields, roadsides and along the banks of streams[7].","Europe, including Britain, from Scandanavia south and east to Spain and temperate Asia.",(0 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(3 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SaponariaOfficinalis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/SaponariaOfficinalis2.jpg","Bloom Color: Pink.

See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from July to September, and the seeds ripen from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Lepidoptera (Moths & Butterflies). It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US.

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Alterative  Antipruritic  Antirheumatic  Antiscrophulatic  Cholagogue  Cytotoxic  Depurative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Expectorant  Purgative  Skin  Sternutatory  TonicSoapwort's main medicinal use is as an expectorant. Its strongly irritant action within the gut is thought to stimulate the cough reflex and increase the production of a more fluid mucus within the respiratory passages[254]. The whole plant, but especially the root, is alterative, antiscrophulatic, cholagogue, depurative, diaphoretic, mildly diuretic, expectorant, purgative, sternutatory and tonic[4, 7, 9, 13, 21, 218]. A decoction of the whole plant can be applied externally to treat itchy skin[4, 201, 238]. The plant has proved of use in the treatment of jaundice and other visceral obstructions[4], but is rarely used internally in modern herbalism due to its irritant effect on the digestive system[238]. When taken in excess, it destroys red blood cells and causes paralysis of the vasomotor centre[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity[4, 7]. The root is harvested in the spring and can be dried for later use[7]. One of the saponins in this plant is proving of interest in the treatment of cancer, it is cytotoxic to the Walker Carcinoma in vitro[218]. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Saponaria officinalis Soapwort. Bouncingbet for coughs/bronchitis (see [302] for critics of commission E).",Soap: Plants used directly as a soap substitute.,"A soap can be obtained by boiling the whole plant (but especially the root) in water[6, 13]. It is a gentle effective cleaner[7, 95], used especially on delicate fabrics that can be harmed by modern synthetic soaps (it has been used to clean the Bayeaux tapestry). It effects a lustre in the fabric[171]. The best soap is obtained by infusing the plant in warm water[169]. The roots can be dried and stored for later use[169]. The plant is sometimes recommended as a hair shampoo, though it can cause eye irritations[238]. The plant spreads vigorously and can be used as a ground cover when planted about 1 metre apart each way[208].",,"Landscape Uses:Border, Rock garden. Succeeds in any moderately fertile well-drained soil in sun or semi-shade[200]. Prefers a neutral to alkaline soil[238]. Hardy to about -20°c[187]. A very ornamental plant[1], soapwort is often grown in the herb garden and is sometimes cultivated for the soap that can be obtained from the roots. There are some named forms, usually with double flowers, that have been selected for their ornamental value[187]. Plants can be very invasive when grown in good conditions[K]. Soapwort should not be grown next to a pond with amphibians or fish in it since if the plant trails into the water it can cause poisoning[238]. The flowers are slightly scented with a sweet aroma that has an undertone of clove[245]. Hybridizes with other members of this genus[200]. A good moth plant[13, 24].

Sow autumn or late winter in a cold frame. The seed usually germinates within 4 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer. Division in spring or autumn. Very easy, it can be successfully done at any time in the growing season if the plants are kept moist until they are re-established. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
