Asia - China, Japan, Korea.",(1 of 5),(3 of 5),Yes,(2 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MiscanthusSinensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/MiscanthusSinensis2.jpg","Bloom Color: Pink, Red. Main Bloom Time: Early fall, Late summer, Late fall, Mid fall. Form: Upright or erect.","Miscanthus sinensis is a PERENNIAL growing to 4 m (13ft) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.",,Ground Cover; Cultivated Beds;,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.,,"Immature flowering spike[105, 177]. No further details are given.","Anticoagulant: Removes blood clots.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Anticoagulant  Diuretic  FebrifugeThe juice of young stems is used to disperse poisons, dissolve blood clots, dissipate extravasated blood and remove inflammation[218]. The plant is diuretic and refrigerant[147, 218].",Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,"Being increasingly grown as a source of biomass, trials are currently (1992) taking place on its potential in Britain[K]. Plants form impenetrably dense clumps and when planted close together in drifts make an excellent ground cover[200].","Industrial Crop: Biomass: Three broad categories: bamboos, resprouting woody plants, and giant grasses. uses include: protein, materials (paper, building materials, fibers, biochar etc.), chemicals (biobased chemicals), energy - biofuels,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Minor Global Crop: These crops are already grown or traded around the world, but on a smaller scale than the global perennial staple and industrial crops, The annual value of a minor global crop is under $1 billion US. Examples include shea, carob, Brazil nuts and fibers such as ramie and sisal.","Industrial Crop: Biomass  Management: Hay  Minor Global CropLandscape Uses:Border, Container, Foundation, Ground cover, Rock garden, Seashore, Specimen. Prefers a deep fertile loamy soil that does not dry out in summer[200] but succeeds in any ordinary soil that is not too dry[1, 162], in sun or light shade[200]. Fully dormant plants are hardy to about -20°c[187], though the young growth in spring can be damaged by late frosts. Often grown as an ornamental plant, there are many named varieties[162]. Many forms do not get enough summer heat to flower freely when they are grown in Britain, 'Silberfeder' (syn 'Silver Feather') is the most free-flowering in cooler climates[187]. Plants can be grown as a focal point in lawns, they also succeed in quite coarse grass[233]. The leaves have saw-toothed edges that can cut the unwary gardener, it is best to wear gloves when working with the plant[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. Special Features:Attracts birds, Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Suitable for cut flowers, Suitable for dried flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - surface sow in spring in a greenhouse and keep moist. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division in spring or early autumn[200]. Very easy, large divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
