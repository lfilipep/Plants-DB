See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",,East Wall. By. South Wall.

One report says that the raw bulb tastes like a raw new potato[183]. It has a crisp nut-like texture and a pleasant flavour when cooked[85, 183]. The bulb can be dried and ground into a powder for making a sweet porridge, mush etc[85, 183, 257]. Leaves - cooked. It is hard to obtain a sufficient quantity[85] and use of the leaves will weaken the bulbs. Seed - ground into a powder[85, 183]. Flower buds - raw. Added to salads[85, 183].","Antirheumatic: Treats rheumatism.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

This is a rather difficult plant to cultivate in Britain, it is very cold hardy but is intolerant of wetness especially in the winter[1, 42]. It is easiest to grow in a bulb frame but is worth trying outdoors at the base of a south-facing wall, especially with shrubs that like these conditions[120]. Bulbs can be lifted as soon as the foliage dies down in the summer and stored overwinter in a cool dry place, replanting in the spring[138]. The bulbs must be replanted immediately according to another report[1]. Bulbs frequently divide after flowering, the bulblets taking 2 years to reach flowering size[200]. This species is closely related to C. ambiguus[214]. Hand pollination is necessary if seed is required[1].","Seed - sow as soon as ripe or early spring in a cold frame in a very sharply draining medium. Stratification may be helpful. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 6 months at 15°c[138]. Leave the seedlings undisturbed for their first two years growth[138], but give them an occasional liquid feed to ensure they do not become nutrient deficient. It is quite difficult to get the seedlings through their first period of dormancy since it is all too easy either to dry them out completely or keep them too moist when they will rot[214]. After their second year of growth, pot up the dormant bulbs in late summer and grow them on for at least another 2 years in the greenhouse before trying them outside. Seedlings take about 5 - 7 years to come into flower[214]. Division of the bulbs as soon as the foliage dies down. The bulbs can be planted straight out into their permanent positions but in areas with wet winters it might be best to store them overwinter and replant them in the spring. Stem bulbils, harvested from the stems after flowering. They can be stored cool and dry then planted in pots in the cold frame in the spring.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
