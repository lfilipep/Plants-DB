24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it might succeed outdoors in the mildest parts of this country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Requires a sheltered position in full sun in a light well-drained soil[200]. Succeeds outdoors in areas where frosts are short-lived and light, to a minimum of -5°, and in such areas grow well in a wild or informal garden[200]. It is best to give the bulbs some protection in the winter, preferably using a cloche or pane of glass[1].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - we have no details for this species but suggest sowing the seed in a greenhouse in a light well-drained compost as soon as it is ripe if possible, otherwise in spring. Sow the seed thinly so that the young plants can be grown on in the same pot for their first year of growth. Apply a liquid feed from time to time if the seedlings look as though they need nutrients and prick them out at the end of their first growing season. Grow on the plants for at least their next winter in a greenhouse and plant out when the bulbs are dormant in late summer or early autumn. Division of offsets in late summer.",
