Form: Palm, Upright or erect.","Phoenix reclinata is an evergreen Tree growing to 6 m (19ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 9 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",P. leonensis. P. spinosa.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; South Wall.

The roasted seed is used as a coffee substitute[2].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Requires a light moist but very well-drained soil in a sheltered position in full sun[231]. Succeeds in dry soils and is also tolerant of poor soils. Plants are tolerant of light shade, though they will not fruit when growing in such a position. Capable of withstanding light frosts, this plant is worth trying outdoors in the very mildest parts of Britain[166]. Although certainly not hardy when young, this palm is unusually hardy when mature[231]. Palms usually have deep penetrating root systems and generally establish best when planted out at a young stage. However, older plants are substantially more cold tolerant than juvenile plants[231]. In areas at the limit of their cold tolerance, therefore, it is prudent to grow the plants in containers for some years, giving them winter protection, and only planting them into their permanent positions when sheer size dictates[231]. This species can be cultivated successfully for a long time in containers[231]. It can also be transplanted even when very large[231]. Although the thick fleshy roots are easily damaged and/or desiccated, new roots are generally freely produced. It is important to stake the plant very firmly to prevent rock, and also to give it plenty of water until re-established - removing many of the leaves can also help[231]. It takes 5 - 6 years from seed before the plant will have produced a full head of leaves and it will not start to form a trunk until this stage is reached[231]. Plants often form suckers around their base[231]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Not North American native, Naturalizing, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - probably best sown as soon as it is ripe in a warm greenhouse, otherwise sow the seed as soon as you obtain it. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 months. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Give the plants some protection from the cold for at least their first winter outdoors.
