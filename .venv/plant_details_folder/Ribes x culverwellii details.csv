18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Fruit - raw or cooked in pies, jams etc[200]. Intermediate in size and flavour between gooseberries and blackcurrants, tasting more like a gooseberry when under-ripe and more like a blackcurrant when fully ripe[K]. The fruit is rich in vitamin C[183].",
20,Medicinal Uses,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content,

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in a moisture retentive but well-drained loamy soil of at least moderate quality[11, 200]. Best grown on a deep sandy loam[1]. Dislikes very heavy clay, chalky soils and thin dry soils, but it can succeed on most soil types if plenty of organic matter is incorporated[1]. Quite tolerant of shade though not fruiting so well in such a position[11]. A group of cultivars of hybrid origin, basically a cross between blackcurrants and gooseberries. Very vigorous plants, producing prolific crops of fruit. They are being grown increasingly in gardens. In general they resist American gooseberry mildew, blackcurrant leaf spot and gall mite. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is multistemmed with multiple stems from the crown [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires 3 months cold stratification at between 0 and 5°c and should be sown as early in the year as possible[113, 164]. Under normal storage conditions the seed can remain viable for 17 years or more. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring of the following year. This plant is a cultivar and will not breed true from seed. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 10 - 15cm with a heel, July/August in a frame[78, 113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, preferably with a heel of the previous year's growth, November to February in a cold frame or sheltered bed outdoors[78, 200].",
