13,Summary,"Artocarpus mariannensis is a large, fast-growing, tropical tree up to 20 m high with a rounded, spreading crown and broadly oval leaves. All parts of the plants are used medicinally. The latex derived from the plant is diluted and taken internally for treatment against diarrhoea, stomach pain, and dysentery. It can be applied externally as well against skin ailments and thrush and other fungal diseases. Further, it can be used as treatment for broken bones and sprain, and as relief from sciatica. Skin ailments can also be treated using crushed leaves and macerated roots of this plant. The sap from the crushed petioles is used against ear infections and sore eyes. Lastly, the bark is used against headaches. The edible fruit has a deep yellow pulp that is sweet. Mature fruits are eaten fresh while immature ones are usually roasted or baked. Seeds are cooked as well. The latex can be used to make chewing gums. Aside from being a medicinal plant and a food source, A. mariannensis provides other purposes like as a trellis for other plants or as an inter-crop. Further, the inner bark can produce fibre that is used in making cordages for fishing. It can also be used as a mosquito-repellent by drying and burning the male flowers of the plant. It is a great agroforestry species for stabilizing and enriching the soil. Other Names: ulu Elihe, Dugdug, Chebiei, Ebiei meduuliou, Dokdok, Maiyah, Mei chocho, Te mai [1b]."

23,Other Uses Description,"Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The plant naturally occurs on steep ridges, cliffs, and shallow calcareous soils where it acts as a soil stabilizer[ 303 ]. It can be inter-planted with a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops such as yam, banana, coconut, taro, papaya, sugarcane, arrowroot, beach hibiscus, Indian mulberry, citrus, soursop, medicinal plants, aroids, ginger and noni, amongst others[ 303 ]. The leaves provide abundant mulch for the tree and other plants growing beneath the canopy[ 303 ]. It is an ideal tree for home gardens on atolls because of its adaptability to calcareous soils and saline conditions and especially for the beneficial shade it produces. The tree can also be used as a trellis for yam[ 303 ]. Other Uses A sticky white latex is present in all parts of the tree[ 303 ]. It is used as a chewing gum, an adhesive, and to caulk canoes[ 303 ]. A fibre is obtained from the inner bark. It is used to make strong cordage used for fishing[ 303 ]. The inner bark was formerly used to make bark cloth (tapa). Sections of the bark were hammered flat with a wooden mallet onto a wooden surface. The more the bark was beaten, the finer the cloth that was made[ K ]. Dried male flowers can be burned to repel mosquitoes and other flying insects[ 303 ]. The flexible leaves are used to wrap foods for cooking in earth ovens, and as plates[ 303 ]. The wood is light in weight, flexible, easy to work[ 303 ]. It is used to make small canoes, carve into statues, bowls, fishing floats, and other objects, although the wood needs to be protected from direct sunlight[ 303 ]. Trunks of larger trees are used to make dug-out canoes[ 354 ]. The wood is fast burning, but generally older, less productive trees are used for fuel[ 303 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Staple Crop: Basic Starch: The Carbon Farming Solution. Eric Toensmeier."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carb  Staple Crop: Basic StarchA plant of lowland tropical areas, usually found at elevations below 150 metres[ 303 ]. It grows best in areas where the mean maximum temperature of hottest month is 29 - 31c and of the coolest month 16 - 18c. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,300 - 3,800mm[ 303 ]. Older plants grow well in a sunny position, but young plants require some shade, with seedlings requiring 20 - 50% shade[ 303 ].
