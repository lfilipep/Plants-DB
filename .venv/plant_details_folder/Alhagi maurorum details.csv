Plants are not very hardy in Britain, they can be grown outdoors in the summer but require protection in the winter[1]. The stems of the plant are covered in sharp spines[245]. Like the closely related gorse (Ulex europaea) the flowers have a pineapple scent[245]. (A slightly strange report because the gorse flowers have a strong coconut fragrance[K].) This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Seed - pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow March/April in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least the first winter. Plant out into their permanent positions in the summer.
