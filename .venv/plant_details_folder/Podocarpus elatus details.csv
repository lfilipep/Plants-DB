The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid and neutral soils.

23,Other Uses Description,"- tough, durable, silky textured. Used for cabinet making, indoor use and boat building[156, 167].",
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a rich moist non-alkaline soil[167]. Resists salt spray[157]. Grows best in areas with a humid climate[200]. Plants tolerate temperatures down to at least -7°c in Australian gardens[157], but this cannot be translated directly to British gardens because of our cooler summers and longer colder and wetter winters. They can be grown outdoors in the milder areas of Britain, preferably in a woodland garden[166]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed can be sown at any time of the year in a sandy soil in a warm greenhouse, though it is probably best sown as soon as it is ripe[1]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 10cm long, July/August in a frame[78].",
