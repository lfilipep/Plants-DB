20,Other Uses,,
21,Other Uses Description,Valuable for screen planting in wet areas[200]. The canes can be used as plant supports[25]. They were used by the Zulus for reinforcing their shields and for making arrows and spear shafts.,
22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a good loamy soil but succeeds in most soils, so long as they remain moist in the summer, in sun or a shady position[200]. Dislikes drought[1]. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c[200]. Plants can reach 6 metres in a moist soil in the warmer parts of the country, but are smaller in dry soils. The canes are about 15mm in diameter[K]. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants only flower at intervals of many years. When they do come into flower most of the plants energies are directed into producing seed and consequently the plant is severely weakened. They sometimes die after flowering, but if left alone they will usually recover though they will look very poorly for a few years. If fed with artificial NPK fertilizers at this time the plants are more likely to die[122]. The rootstock is running[25], producing new shoots from late May[25]. It can be invasive in the warmer parts of Britain but is usually fairly well behaved[200].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow as soon as it is ripe in a greenhouse at about 20°c. Do not allow the compost to dry out. Germination usually takes place fairly quickly so long as the seed is of good quality, though it can take 3 - 6 months. Grow on in a lightly shaded place in the greenhouse until large enough to plant out. Seed is rarely available. Division in spring as new growth commences. Take divisions with at least three canes in the clump, trying to cause as little root disturbance to the main plant as possible. Grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse in pots of a high fertility sandy medium. Mist the foliage regularly until plants are established. Plant them out into their permanent positions when a good root system has developed, which can take a year or more[200]. Basal cane cuttings. Rhizome cuttings.",
