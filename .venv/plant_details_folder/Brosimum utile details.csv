19,Edible Uses Description,"nutritious, milky sap, or latex, flows out of incisions made in the bark[307 ]. The nourishing white liquid, which is slightly viscous and resinous, is consumed like milk[307 , 317 ]. The sap is also said to taste like cream when fresh and is sometimes used to lighten coffee.   It can also be used to create a 'cheese' that is made from the thread-like curds that form on the surface of the liquid when it is exposed to the air[307 ]. The latex has been used as a base for chewing gum[46 ]. The fleshy fruit with the nutritious seeds are eaten boiled and salted[317 ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

22,Other Uses,"Fibre: Used for making cloth, rope, paper etc.,Furniture: A few miscellaneous uses that do not fit easily into other headings.,Latex: A source of rubber.,Lighting: Plants that can be used as torches etc. See also Oil and Wax.,Paper: Related to the entry for Fibre, these plants have been specifically mentioned for paper making.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.",
23,Other Uses Description,"The fibrous bark has been used for making cloth, blankets and sails[46 ]. The latex is rich in wax-like substances and has been used to make candles[317 ]. The heartwood is a uniform yellowish white to yellowish brown or light brown with golden shades; it is not distinctly demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight to widely and shallowly interlocked; the lustre high; when seasoned there is no odour or taste. The wood is of moderate weight; soft to moderately hard; not very durable, being susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons normally, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once seasoned it is poorly stable in service. The wood works well with ordinary tools, however they need to be kept sharp otherwise the interlocked grain and the tension wood which is sometimes prevalent can cause fuzzy grain and burning of saws due to pinching; it takes stains and finishes readily; takes nails and screws well; presents no gluing problems. It is used for purposes such as light carpentry, light construction, flooring, furniture components, plywood, particleboard, fibreboard, pulp and paper products, and mouldings[316 , 848 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas. Plants are usually resprouting plants and saps.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",
