The nourishing white liquid, which is slightly viscous and resinous, is consumed like milk[307 , 317 ]. The sap is also said to taste like cream when fresh and is sometimes used to lighten coffee.   It can also be used to create a 'cheese' that is made from the thread-like curds that form on the surface of the liquid when it is exposed to the air[307 ]. The latex has been used as a base for chewing gum[46 ]. The fleshy fruit with the nutritious seeds are eaten boiled and salted[317 ].","Analgesic: Relieves pain.,Antitussive: Prevents or relieves coughing.",Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

The heartwood is a uniform yellowish white to yellowish brown or light brown with golden shades; it is not distinctly demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight to widely and shallowly interlocked; the lustre high; when seasoned there is no odour or taste. The wood is of moderate weight; soft to moderately hard; not very durable, being susceptible to fungi, dry wood borers and termites. It seasons normally, with only a slight risk of checking or distortion; once seasoned it is poorly stable in service. The wood works well with ordinary tools, however they need to be kept sharp otherwise the interlocked grain and the tension wood which is sometimes prevalent can cause fuzzy grain and burning of saws due to pinching; it takes stains and finishes readily; takes nails and screws well; presents no gluing problems. It is used for purposes such as light carpentry, light construction, flooring, furniture components, plywood, particleboard, fibreboard, pulp and paper products, and mouldings[316 , 848 ].","Industrial Crop: Hydrocarbon: Materials, chemicals and energy include bioplastics, rubber, biomass products gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, butane, propane, biogas.
