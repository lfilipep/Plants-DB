Some trees in Penzance in Cornwall were 6 metres tall in 1930 and withstood temperatures down to -10°c[11]. Some provenances from New Zealand should withstand at least -5°c, more if they are grown in a sunny sheltered position[200]. Pruning is tolerated if it is required[188]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if fruit and seed is required.","Seed - sow as soon as it is ripe or in early spring in a greenhouse[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts[78]. Consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first few winters outdoors. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 5 - 10cm long with a heel, June/July in a frame[78].
