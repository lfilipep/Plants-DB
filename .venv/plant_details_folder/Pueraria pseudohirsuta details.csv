Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].",Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow in a warm greenhouse in early spring. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out after the last expected frosts[200].
