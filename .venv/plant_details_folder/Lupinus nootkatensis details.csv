0,Lupinus nootkatensis,"Blue Lupine, Nootka lupine",Fabaceae or Leguminosae,4-8,"The seed of many lupin species contain bitter-tasting toxic alkaloids, though there are often sweet varieties within that species that are completely wholesome[65, 76]. Taste is a very clear indicator. These toxic alkaloids can be leeched out of the seed by soaking it overnight and discarding the soak water. It may also be necessary to change the water once during cooking. Fungal toxins also readily invade the crushed seed and can cause chronic illness[65].",Roadsides and open banks[43]. Shingle banks in rivers in Scotland[187].,North-western N. America to N. Asia. Naturalized in Britain.,(3 of 5),(3 of 5),No,(0 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LupinusNootkatensis.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/LupinusNootkatensis2.jpg",,"Lupinus nootkatensis is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.7 m (2ft 4in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Cultivated Beds;,"Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.,Seedpod: things such as Okra, French and Runner beans.",,"Seed - cooked[105]. Used as a protein-rich vegetable or savoury dish in any of the ways that cooked beans are used, they can also be roasted or ground into a powder. If the seed is bitter this is due to the presence of toxic alkaloids and the seed should be thoroughly leached before being cooked[2, 105]. Root - raw or cooked[256, 257]. Peeled and then eaten raw or boiled[257]. The roots are harvested in the spring and are then roasted before being eaten[256]. The roasted root can be dried, ground into a flour and then stored for later use. The raw root should not be eaten since they contain toxic alkaloids and will cause a drunken-like state if eaten in excess, but the cooked root is safe to eat[256, 257]. Seedpods - cooked[105].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,Ornamental. Nitrogen fixer. Dynamic accumulator.,,"An easily grown plant, succeeding in any moderately good soil in a sunny position[200]. This species is very susceptible to slug damage, the plant has been cultivated as an ornamental, but has virtually died out in the garden though it grows well in the wild in Scotland[187]. Closely related to L. perennis[200] and possibly no more than a sub-species of it[50], the uses listed below are for L. perennis but it is assumed that they also apply to this species[K]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200].","Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in warm water and then sow in early spring in a greenhouse. Germination should take place within a couple of weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in early summer. It should also be possible to sow the seed outdoors in situ in the middle of spring. It might be necessary to protect this sowing from mice. Division in early March[1]. Difficult. Basal cuttings in April[1]. Harvest the shoots when they are about 10cm long with plenty of underground stem. Pot them up into individual pots and keep them in light shade in a cold frame or greenhouse until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
