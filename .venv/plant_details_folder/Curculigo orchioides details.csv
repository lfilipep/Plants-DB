It is especially valued in Chinese traditional medicine as a general tonic and restorative in the treatment of decline (especially of physical strength)[ 310 ]. A bitter tasting, mucilaginous herb, it is said to be adaptogenic, analeptic, androgenic, anticonvulsive, antiinflammatory, aphrodisiac, diuretic, emmenagogue, sedative, tonic and uterine tonic[ 310 ]. It also has a stimulating effect upon the immune system[ 310 ]. Pharmacological studies have shown the presence of several medically active compounds in the rhizome including saponins and glycosides. Curculigosaponins C and F can promote the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes very significantly[ 310 ]. Curculigosaponins F and G increase the weight of the thymus[ 310 ]. Curculigoside exerts immunological and protective effects[ 310 ]. In addition to its use as a general restorative, the rhizome is used internally in the treatment of a range of diseases including peptic ulcers, piles, gonorrhoea, leucorrhoea, asthma, jaundice, chronic nephritis, diarrhoea, lumbago and headache[ 310 ]. Externally, the rhizome is used to treat skin diseases[ 310 ]. The rhizomes are washed, freed from roots, and sliced; the slices are dried in the shade[ 310 ]. Usually the dried slices are powdered, and small amounts of powder are mixed in a glass of milk with sugar or used to prepare a decoction for drinking[ 310 ]. Swelling of the tongue has been reported as a side-effect after drinking a decoction from the rhizome; in China the recommended antidote is a decoction of Rheum tanguticum with sodium sulphate[ 310 ].",
