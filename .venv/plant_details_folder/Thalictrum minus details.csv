24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"We have almost no information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. This species is not mentioned in Flora Europaea[50]. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in most fairly good soils in sun or semi-shade[1, 111]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54]. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. The seed can also be sown in an outdoor seedbed in spring[111]. Plant them into their permanent positions the following spring. Division in spring as new growth commences or in the autumn[111]. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is best to pot up smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a greenhouse or cold frame until they are growing away well. Plant them out in the summer or the following spring."
