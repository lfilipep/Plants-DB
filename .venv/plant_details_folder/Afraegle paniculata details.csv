Other Uses The leaves are sometimes macerated and added to the water used for bathing[319 ]. The wood is used to make household, domestic and personal items[332 ]."
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Glue: Plants used to make glue products.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil)."
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Glue  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilIn the quasi-tropical coastal region near Miami, Florida, which has an unusual type of soil consisting largely of porous-limestone rock intermingled with fine sand or very sandy loam, this species, when well fertilized, makes extraordinary growth - a specimen growing near Coconut Grove, when only four or five years old and only 1.6 - 1.8 metres tall, had a lateral spread of 4.5 - 6 metres[319 ]. As it grew older, it became much taller but still had long branches[319 ]."
