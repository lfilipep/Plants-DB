0,Equisetum fluviatile,"Swamp Horsetail, Water horsetail",Equisetaceae,Coming soon,"Large quantities of the plant can be toxic. This is because it contains the enzyme thiaminase[172], a substance that can rob the body of the vitamin B complex[65]. In small quantities this enzyme will do no harm to people eating an adequate diet that is rich in vitamin B, though large quantities can cause severe health problems. The enzyme is destroyed by heat or thorough drying, so cooking the plant will remove the thiaminase[172]. The plant also contains equisetic acid - see the notes on medicinal uses for more information[213].","Shallow water in lakes, ponds and ditches[17].","Arctic and temperate regions of Europe, including Britain, N.
