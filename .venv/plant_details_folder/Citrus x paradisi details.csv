An essential oil obtained from the peel is used as a flavouring in soft drinks, chewing gum, sweets, baked goods, ice cream etc[ 301 , 317 , 418 ]. An oil can be obtained from the seed. When refined, it makes a good culinary oil[ 301 , 317 ].",

24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Three main climates are suitable for commercial citrus production - tropical climates, subtropical with winter rain such as in the Mediterranean and semitropical with summer rainfall as found in Florida and southern Brazil[ 200 ]. The optimal temperatures for citrus cultivation range between 25 - 30°c, with the coldest month having an average minimum of at least 15°c[ 200 ]. Growth generally ceases below 13°c and above 38°c[ 200 ]. If there are dry periods of more than three months, then irrigation will be necessary[ 200 ]. This species is better suited to the tropics than the subtropics[ 307 ]. The flowers and fruit cannot tolerate frost, whilst the tree itself is killed at temperatures of -7°c[ 418 ]. Prefers a deep, well-drained but moisture-retentive loamy soil in full sun[ 200 ]. Tolerant of alkaline soils[ 307 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[ 307 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5 - 6[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 6.5 - 7.3, tolerating 6 - 8.3[ 418 ] The first fruits can be harvested when the tree is 7 - 8 years old. The tree has an economical life of 30 - 35 years[ 418 ]. A fruit yield of 40 - 44 tonnes/ha is regarded as a good yield in Florida, whilst in Trinidad and Surinam average yields may be nearer 24 tonnes/ha[ 418 ]. Long days stimulate vegetative growth, whilst short days may stimulate flowering[ 418 ]. There are many named varieties[ 301 ]. Container, Espalier, Standard, Specimen.",
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed is best sown in containers as soon as it is ripe, after thoroughly rinsing it[ 164 , 200 ]. Sow stored seed in containers as soon as possible]. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 13°c. Seedlings are liable to damp off so they must be watered with care and kept well ventilated. The seed is usually polyembryonic, two or more seedlings arise from each seed and they are genetically identical to the parent but they do not usually carry any virus that might be present in the parent plant[ 200 ]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on until they are 10cm or more tall before planting out into their permanent positions. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. This species grows easily from cuttings[ 200 ]. Layering in October.",
