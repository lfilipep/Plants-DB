See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8. It is in leaf all year, in flower from October to November, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought. The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure. It cannot tolerate atmospheric pollution.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,None known,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Carminative: Reduces flatulence and expels gas from the intestines.,Diaphoretic: Induces perspiration.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis,Urinary: Treats urinary problems, including urinary tract infection (UTI).","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Astringent  Carminative  Diaphoretic  Diuretic  Dysentery  Skin  TB  UrinaryThe heartwood is carminative, diaphoretic, diuretic and expectorant[240, 272]. A decoction of the wood is used in the treatment of fevers, flatulence, pulmonary and urinary disorders, rheumatism, piles, kidney stones, insomnia, diabetes etc[240, 254]. It has been used as an antidote to snake bites[240, 243]. The plant yields a medicinal essential oil by distillation of the wood, it is used in the treatment of phthisis, bronchitis, blennorrhagia and skin eruptions[4, 158, 240]. A resin obtained from the wood is used externally to treat bruises, skin diseases and injuries to joints[272]. The bark is astringent. It has proved useful in the treatment of fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery[240, 243]. In Ayurvedic medicine the leaves are used in the treatment of tuberculosis[254]. An oil obtained from the seed is diaphoretic[272]. It is applied externally to treat skin diseases[272].","Shelterbelt: Wind resistant plants than can be grown to provide shelter in the garden etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","A fairly wind-tolerant tree, it can be used in shelterbelt plantings[200].  - moderately hard, durable, aromatic, fine and even grained. Resistant to termites, it is used for construction, furniture, boats etc[51, 61, 145, 158, 272]. A valuable timber, but a poor fuel, producing a lot of smoke as it burns[51, 272].",,"Landscape Uses:Espalier, Specimen Thrives on most soils, being very tolerant of dry sites and of drought when it is established[81, 200]. Succeeds in very chalky soils[200]. Prefers a rich loam or a sandy clay in full sun[1]. Succeeds in warm dry areas with less than 40cm of rain a year, but also in areas with cool summers and up to 200cm of rain[200]. Dislikes atmospheric pollution[11]. Plants are fairly wind tolerant[200]. This species is the least hardy of the genus and does not always succeed outdoors in Britain[11] although some clones are hardy down to zone 5 and grow well in this country[200]. The hardiest forms come from the west of its range[81]. Trees thrive best in the cooler and moister areas of Britain[11]. Small trees less than 50cm tall establish much more quickly and better than taller trees, those that are more than 2 metres tall are difficult to establish[200]. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Plants are said to live for up to 600 years in the wild[227]. New growth takes place from May to the end of September and can exceed 1 metre per year, slowing down as the tree gets larger and virtually ceasing by the time the tree is 20 metres tall[185]. This species is sometimes cultivated for timber in some parts of S. Europe[50]. Small male cones are formed on the lower branches of trees, whilst the larger female cones are formed on higher branches[238]. These female cones persist on the tree for 2 - 3 years before breaking up[238]. Trees are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. The whole plant is aromatic[245]. Special Features:Attractive foliage, Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - collect the cones in winter and keep in a warm room until they open[1]. Sow immediately in a cold frame[78]. One report says that a short cold stratification of one month improves germination rates[113]. Keep the seed pot moist, but be careful because the young seedlings are very prone to damp off, keep them well ventilated[113]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter and plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them some protection from winter cold for their first winter or two outdoors[K]. Cuttings of terminal shoots can be tried in a frame in November but they are very difficult[113].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
