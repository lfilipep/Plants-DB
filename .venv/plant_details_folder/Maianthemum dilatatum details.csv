The fruits are about the size of small peas and are produced in terminal clusters on the plants, they are not regarded very highly[256]. North American Indian children would eat the raw unripe green berries straight from the plant[256]. Adults would usually harvest the green berries and then store them in water until they turned red and were soft[256]. Alternatively they would dry the green berries and then boil them for a few minutes[256]. Young leaves - cooked[177]."

24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a cool shady moist but not wet position[1, 187]. Plants tolerate warm summers only if the soil remains moist[200]. A mat forming plant, it can be invasive in good conditions[200]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown quite thinly it as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame, it should germinate in the spring. Stored seed should be sown in late winter in a cold frame, it might take 18 months to germinate. Allow the seedlings to grow on in the pot for their first year, giving liquid feeds as necessary to ensure that they do not go hungry. Divide the plants into individual pots once they have died down in late summer. Grow them on in pots for another year or more until large enough to plant out[K]. Division as new growth commences in the spring. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring."
