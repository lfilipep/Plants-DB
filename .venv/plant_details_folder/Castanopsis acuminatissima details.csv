23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: The tree has a heavy fall of leaves which form a deep mulch on the ground and inhibit the growth of other plants. The tree is planted as a pioneer species in northern Thailand in reforestation projects to restore native woodland - it is planted in degraded woodland and open areas in a mix with various other species that all have the ability to grow fast; produce dense, weed-suppressing crowns; and attract seed-dispersing wildlife, particularly birds and bats[998 ]. Other Uses The wood is white[443 ]. It is used for making furniture, bridges, flooring, plywood, boat building[611 ]. The trunks and bark are used in traditional house construction[317 ]. The wood can be used for fuel[443 , 611 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Balanced carbA fast-growing tree[998 ]. The tree has surface roots and often forms a ring of suckers around the base of the trunk[451 , 658 ].  it is a predominant tree in the lower montane forests, lying between 900-1000 and 2000 meters elevation. It can also be found at lower elevations on small-crowned hill forests, in association with Hopea papuana and the drought-tolerant Casuarina papuana.",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - easy to germinate if sown fresh. Self-sown seedlings can be transplanted[658 ]. Suckers are formed near the base, but these often do not transplant well[658 ].",
