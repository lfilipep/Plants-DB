24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a well-drained humus rich fertile soil in full sun[200]. A frost-tender shrub, it can be grown as an annual in temperate climates where it can flower and set seed in its first year of growth[200, K]. Plants can also be overwintered in a cold greenhouse if the winter is fairly mild[K]. As the specific name of this plant suggests, the leaves vary widely in shape. The first leaves to be produced are semi-circular in shape, but later leaves are distinctly three-lobed[K]. Plants are self-fertile[K].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[200]. The seed germinates inside 2 weeks and should be potted up into individual pots as soon as it is large enough to handle. Grow the plants on fast in a fairly rich compost and plant them out in late spring after the last expected frosts[K]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. These will be difficult to overwinter unless kept in heated environment[K].",
