24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a lime-free soil[1]. Prefers a sheltered semi-shaded position and a light deep moist soil[1, 11]. Plants can only be grown in oceanic and Mediterranean climates, thriving in Britain[200]. In N. America this plant grows better at low elevations than C. chrysophylla. A specimen at Edinburgh Botanical Gardens is 3.5 metres tall and 6 metres across[11]. A very ornamental shrub[183]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe, the seed must be protected from mice etc[200]. The seed has a short viability and should not be allowed to dry out. If stored overwinter it should be kept cool and moist. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts, and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter outdoors."
