24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil[200]. Prefers a pH of 5.5 to 7[200]. Prefers a cool moist reasonably fertile soil[52]. The plant is shallow rooted and intolerant of drought, it responds well to a moist fertile soil but succeeds in poorer soils than standard Pak choi[206]. Hardy to about -10°c, the plants stand up well to snow but are less likely to stand up to prolonged winter wet[206]. The prostrate forms are hardier than semi-prostrate forms[206]. The rosette pak choi is widely cultivated in China for its edible leaves, there are several named varieties[206]. It is slower-growing than standard Pak choi, B. rapa chinensis[206]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow in situ July/August. Spring sown crops are prone to run quickly to seed if there is a spell of cold weather[206]. Some varieties can also be sown in a cold greenhouse in autumn or early spring to provide leaves overwinter and in late spring.
