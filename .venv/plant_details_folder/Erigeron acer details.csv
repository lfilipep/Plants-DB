25,Cultivation Details Description,"Prefers a moderately fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Grows well in dry situations[4]. Succeeds in maritime gardens[233]. There is some doubt over the correct name of this species. E. acris is said to be a synonym of E. acer[200], the report of edibility refers to the sub-species E. acris kamtschaticus[105]. The entry is included under E. acer but this needs further investigation. Very few members of this genus will hybridise with other members of the genus[274].",
