It has an open and rounded crown and a crooked bole that can be about 30 cm in diameter. It grows up to 9 m in height. It is usually grown in South America particularly in eastern and northeastern Brazil and Bolivia and can be used as a pioneer species for restoring native woodland. The wood is only used for construction, light cabinet making and tool handles, for fuel and to make charcoal.","Pityrocarpa moniliformis is a deciduous Tree growing to 7 m (23ft) by 7 m (23ft) at a fast rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10. The flowers are pollinated by Insects. It can fix Nitrogen.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry moist or  wet soil and can tolerate drought.",Piptadenia moniliformis Benth.,,None known,,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

Other Uses The wood is medium-textured, cross-grained, heavy, with moderate mechanical properties and of good durability. Because of its small dimensions it is only used locally for purposes such as construction, light cabinet making and tool handles[420 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[420 ].",,"Grows best in a sunny position[420 ]. Prefers a fertile, alluvial soil, especially if sandy[420 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[420 ]. The plant self-sows very freely in open areas, to the extent that it is considered a weed of pastures by cattle ranchers[420 ]. A fairly fast-growing plant when young, easily reaching a height of 2 metres within 2 years from seed[420 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755 ].","Seed - it has a hard seedcoat and benefits from scarification before sowing to speed up and improve germination. This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Sow the treated seed in a sunny position in a nursery seedbed. A low germination rate can be expected if the seed is not treated, with the seed sprouting within 14 - 21 days[420 ].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
