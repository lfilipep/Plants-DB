Form: Oval, Upright or erect.","Arbutus menziesii is an evergreen Tree growing to 15 m (49ft) by 15 m (49ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, in flower from April to May, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil.",A. procera.,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw or cooked[2, 92, 105, 161, 183]. A bland taste[229]. Very sour according to another report[226]. After boiling the fruit can be dried for later use[183]. The fruit is about 15mm in diameter[200].","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Miscellany: Various medicinal actions that need more clarification.,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Vulnerary: Promotes the healing of wounds.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Astringent  Miscellany  Stomachic  VulneraryThe leaves are stomachic and vulnerary[168, 257]. They can be used in the treatment of stomach ache and cramps, colds etc[257]. The leaves can be applied as a poultice to burns[257]. The bitter principles in the bark and leaves can be used as an astringent[229]. An infusion of the bark has been used in the treatment of diabetes and externally to treat sores, cuts and wounds[257]. It has also been used as a gargle for sore throats[257].","Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Dye: Plants that provide dyes.,Miscellany: A rag-bag of items that are difficult to categorise.,Tannin: An astringent substance obtaied from plants, it is used medicinally, as a dye and mordant, stabilizer in pesticide etc.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","The inner bark was sometimes used by native North American Indians to make dresses[257]. The leaves can be used to test the temperature of pitch that is being used to waterproof canoes. When the leaves turn black the pitch is ready to use[257]. A brown dye is obtained from the bark[57, 106], it does not need a mordant[168]. Use in spring or summer[168]. The bark is a rich source of tannin[46, 61, 82, 226], it is used medicinally[168]. The tannin is also used as a preservative on wood, ropes etc[257].  - very hard, brittle, durable in water, close grained, heavy, strong. The wood does not split when it dries and so has been used for carving[257]. It is also sometimes used for making furniture, it also produces a fine grade of charcoal[46, 61, 82, 99, 229].",,"Landscape Uses:Specimen. Requires a lime-free nutrient-rich well-drained moisture-retentive soil in sun or semi-shade and shelter from cold drying winds, especially when young[200]. Succeeds in a limy soil according to another report[182]. Hardy to about -10°c[200], trees succeed outdoors at Kew but shoots of young plants are apt to be cut back in winter[11]. They grow very well in S.W. England[11]. An ideal plant for the small garden or as a lawn specimen, it has a neat, compact, upright growth habit, retaining its lower leafy branches close to the ground and casting little shade[245]. The flowers have a honey-like fragrance which will pervade the whole garden on calm days[245]. Trees are slow-growing in the wild, living up to 225 years[229], though they are fairly fast growing in cultivation when young[11]. They dislike being transplanted and should be placed in their final positions as soon as possible[11, 134, 166]. Give them some protection in their first winter outdoors. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Special Features:North American native, Fragrant flowers, Attractive flowers or blooms.","Seed - best surface sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed should be soaked for 5 - 6 days in warm water and then surface sown in a shady position in a greenhouse[78]. Do not allow the compost to become dry. 6 weeks cold stratification helps[134]. The seed usually germinates well in 2 - 3 months at 20°c[134]. Seedlings are prone to damp off[184], they are best transplanted to individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and should be kept well ventilated. Grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts[K]. Basal cuttings in late winter[200]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November/December in a frame. Poor percentage[78]. Layering of young wood - can take 2 years[1, 200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
