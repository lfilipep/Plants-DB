13,Summary,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Juniperus recurva is an evergreen Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 6 m (19ft) at a slow rate. See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 7. It is in leaf all year, and the seeds ripen in October. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil."

21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.EmeticSmoke from the green wood is emetic and produces long-continued vomiting[240].
22,Other Uses,"Essential: Essential oils that are used in perfumery, medicines, paint solvents, insect repellents etc.,Incense: Aromatic plants that can be burnt to impart a pleasant smell, repel insects and disinfect closed areas."
23,Other Uses Description,"The wood and leaves are used as an incense[272]. The resinous twigs are burnt as an incense[2, 146]. The leaves contain about 1.7% essential oil[272]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils if they are well drained, preferring a neutral or slightly alkaline soil[1, 11] and succeeding on chalk[200]. Prefers a humid sheltered site, doing well in areas with high rainfall[200]. Does not succeed in dry areas[200]. Unlike most members of the genus, this species grows better in the wetter western part of Britain[11]. A very ornamental plant[1] but slow growing in Britain, even young trees fail to average 25cm a year[185]. Plants are resistant to honey fungus[88]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required."
26,Plant Propagation,"The seed requires a period of cold stratification. The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration[78, 81]. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process[11]. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened). The seedlings can be potted up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow on in pots until large enough, then plant out in early summer. When stored dry, the seed can remain viable for several years[1]. Cuttings of mature wood, 5 - 10cm with a heel, September/October in a cold frame. Plant out in the following autumn[1, 78]. Layering in September/October. Takes 12 months[78]."
