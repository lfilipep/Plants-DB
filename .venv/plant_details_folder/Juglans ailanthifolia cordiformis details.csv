See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June. The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and is pollinated by Wind. The plant is self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Canopy;,"Leaves: ,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.","Oil: Oil,Oil: ","d - raw or cooked[183]. They are also used in sweets, pies etc[183]. A mild and pleasant flavour, they can be eaten in quantity for dessert[183]. The shell is thin and easily cracked[117]. It is considered to be superior in taste to C. ailanthifolia. An edible oil is obtained from the seed[183], though it tends to go rancid quickly. Young buds (leaf?) and peduncles - cooked[105, 177].","Anthelmintic: Expels parasites from the gut.,Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Kidney: Used in the treatment of kidney diseases,Lithontripic: Removes stones from the kidney, bladder etc.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.,Tonic: Improves general health.

Rich in tannin, it does not require a mordant. The bark is rich in tannin. It is used as a dye and also medicinally[178]. Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree[18, 20, 159]. The roots of many members of this genus produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200].  - soft, light, not easily cracked, of good quality.

Non-Destructive management systems.,Other Systems: Strip intercrop: Tree crops grown in rows with alternating annual crops.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Protein-oil: (16+ percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Annuals include soybeans, peanuts, sunflower seeds. Perennials include seeds, beans, nuts, and fruits such as almond, Brazil nut, pistachio, walnut, hazel, and safou.","Management: Standard  Other Systems: Strip intercrop  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: Protein-oilRequires a deep well-drained loam and a sunny position sheltered from strong winds[1, 11]. Prefers a slightly alkaline soil[200]. This is the hardiest member of the genus[63], it should succeed outdoors in most parts of the country. It is also resistant to most insects[160]. The young growth in spring, however, can be damaged by late frosts. This is a form of C. ailanthifolia with a thinner shell and a better tasting nut. It is cultivated for its edible seed in Japan and has the potential for producing very superior nuts, especially if hybridized with J. cinerea[117, 160]. There are some named varieties[183]. Plants can come into bearing in 3 - 4 years from seed[63]. Even when grown on a very windy site in Cornwall, the plants flowered in their eighth year from seed (by which time they were more sheltered from the wind)[K] Plants produce a deep taproot and they are intolerant of root disturbance[1, 11]. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and then given some protection since they are somewhat tender when young[1, 11]. Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer[200]. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2°c, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf[200]. Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree[200]. Trees have a dense canopy which tends to reduce plant growth below them[K]. We have no specific information for this species, but the roots of several members of this genus produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.)[200]. The leaves of many species also secrete substances that have an inhibitory affect on plants growing underneath them. All in all this is not a very good companion plant[K]. In garden design, as well as the above-ground architecture of a plant, root structure considerations help in choosing plants that work together for their optimal soil requirements including nutrients and water. The root pattern is branching: a heart root, dividing from the crown into several primary roots going down and out [2-1].","The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual deep pots in a cold frame[80]. You need to protect it from mice, birds, squirrels etc. The seed usually germinates in late winter or the spring. Plant out the seedlings into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two. The seed can also be stored in cool moist conditions (such s the salad compartment of a fridge) over the winter and sown in early spring but it may then require a period of cold stratification before it will germinate[78, 80].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
