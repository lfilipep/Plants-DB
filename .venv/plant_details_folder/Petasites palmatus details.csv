Main Bloom Time: Late winter. Form: Spreading or horizontal.,"Petasites palmatus is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.4 m (1ft 4in) by 1 m (3ft 3in) at a fast rate. It is in flower from February to April, and the seeds ripen in April. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Insects. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist or  wet soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge; not Deep Shade; Meadow; Bog Garden;,"Flowers: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.",Salt: plants that provide a substitute for salt.,"Young flower stalks, used before the flower buds appear, are boiled until tender and seasoned with salt[172, 177, 183]. Flower buds - cooked[183]. Leafstalks - peeled and eaten raw[105, 177, 183, 257]. The ash of the plant is used as a salt substitute[46, 61, 95, 102, 183]. To prepare the salt, the stems and leaves are rolled up into balls whilst still green, and after being carefully dried they are placed on top of a very small fire on a rock and burned[213].","Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Pectoral  Salve  TBThe roots have been used in treating the first stages of grippe and consumption[257]. The dried and grated roots have been applied as a dressing on boils, swellings and running sores[257]. An infusion of the crushed roots has been used as a wash for sore eyes[257]. A syrup for treating coughs and lung complaints has been made from the roots of this species combined with mullein(Verbascum sp.) and plum root (Prunus sp.)[257].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Seashore, Woodland garden. Succeeds in ordinary garden soil[1], but prefers a deep fertile humus-rich soil that is permanently moist but not stagnant, succeeding in shade, semi-shade or full sun[200]. Requires a moist shady position[187]. Plants can be grown in quite coarse grass, which can be cut annually in the autumn[233]. Plants are hardy to about -20°c[187]. A very invasive plant, too rampant for anything other than the wild garden[187, 200]. Dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Special Features:Attractive foliage, North American native, Invasive, Wetlands plant.","Seed - we have no information on this species but suggest sowing the seed in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe or in early spring. Only just cover the seed and do not allow the compost to dry out. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the summer. Division succeeds at almost any time of the year. Very easy, larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found that it is better to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame until they are well established before planting them out in late spring or early summer.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
