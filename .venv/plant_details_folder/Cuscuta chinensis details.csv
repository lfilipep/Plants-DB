22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it could succeed outdoors at least in the milder parts of this country. This is a parasitic species that is devoid of leaves, roots or chlorophyll and so is totally dependant upon its host[238]. It is most commonly found growing on plants in the families Leguminosae, Compositae and Zygophyllaceae and must be grown next to the host plant, which it penetrates with suckers in order to obtain nutriment[238, 266].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn, by lodging it among the stems of a host plant[238].",
