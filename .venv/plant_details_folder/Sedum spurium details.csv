22,Other Uses,
23,Other Uses Description,"Can be used as a ground cover plant in a sunny position[197, 208]. It requires weeding for the first year or so[197]."
24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[188] but prefers a fertile well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Established plants are drought tolerant[200]. Tolerates poor soils. Hardy to about -5°c[200]. A mat-forming plant, it is very invasive[83]. The flowers of this species are white or pink[200]. All members of this genus are said to have edible leaves, though those species that have yellow flowers can cause stomach upsets if they are eaten in quantity[62, 85]. Plants in this genus seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - surface sow in spring in well-drained soil in a sunny position in a greenhouse. Do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made, it is possible to plant them out during the summer, otherwise keep them in a cold-frame or greenhouse for their first winter and plant them out in early summer of the following year[K]. Division is very easy and can be carried out at almost any time in the growing season, though is probably best done in spring or early summer. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. We have found it best to pot up the smaller divisions and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a cold frame, planting them out once they are well established in the summer."
