16,Plant Habitats,,
17,Edible Parts,"Fruit: ,Leaves: ,Root: includes bulbs, corms, tubers, rhizomes etc.,Seed: includes nuts, cereals, peas and beans.",
18,Edible Uses,"Apical bud: Typically, the end of a shoot contains an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs.,Inner bark: the bark that is found just beneath the tough outer bark of trees and shrubs.,Oil: Oil,Oil: ",
19,Edible Uses Description,"d from the pith of the trunk and from the roots[297 , 419 ]. The pith of the trunk can be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink[297 ]. Fruit - cooked[297 ]. Rich in oil, it can be quite bitter[297 ]. The yellowish pulp is fibrous, mucilaginous and slightly sweet[416 ]. The sweet, pulpy portion of the fruit is eaten raw[301 ]. Eaten in times of scarcity[46 ]. Seed - roasted[317 ]. A high quality oil can be obtained from the seed kernel[297 ]. When refined it can be used for cooking[46 , 317 ]. Young leaves - cooked and eaten as a vegetable[317 ]. The apical bud, known as a 'palm heart' is eaten[763 ]. If the apical bud is removed, then the tree is condemned to a slow death since it is unable to produce side branches[K ].",
20,Medicinal Uses,,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.The roots are used medicinally[317 ].,
22,Other Uses,"Oil: Vegetable oils have many uses, as lubricants, lighting, soap and paint making, waterproofing etc. This does not include the edible oils unless they are also mentioned as having other uses.",
23,Other Uses Description,"Agroforestry Uses: When growing wild, the plant is seen as an indicator of good, fertile soils[419 ]. Other Uses A useful twine can be obtained from the leaves by tearing strips of the desired width from the leaflets[297 ]. A good quality fibre is obtained from the leaves. Very strong, it is used to make ropes and cordage[454 ]. A high quality oil can be obtained from the seed kernel[297 ]. It can be used for making soap[46 ]. Another oil can be obtained from the pulp of the fruit[317 ]. It is used for making soap[317 ]. The very hard endocarp that encloses the seed can be cut into rings or carved and pierced for use as rosary beads[297 ]. It is also used for making jewellery and buttons[317 ]. The stem consists o a central pithy section surrounded by a ring of wood. This outer wood is moderately heavy, hard and very durable. It is used locally as beams and laths in rural constructions[419 ].",
24,Cultivation Details,"Industrial Crop: Fiber: Clothing, rugs, sheets, blankets etc. Currently, almost none of our fiber are produced from perennial crops but could be!,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.,Staple Crop: Oil: (0-15 percent protein, 16+ percent oil). Some of these are consumed whole while others are exclusively pressed for oil. Annuals include canola, poppyseed, maize, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut. Perennials include high-oil fruits, seeds, and nuts, such as olive, coconut, avocado, oil palm, shea, pecan, and macadamia. Some perennial oil crops are consumed whole as fruits and nuts, while others are exclusively pressed for oil (and some are used fresh and for oil).",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Standard  Regional Crop  Staple Crop: OilA plant of semi-arid to very moist lowland regions of the tropics, where it is usually found below an elevation of 1,000 metres[297 , 418 ]. It grows best in areas where temperatures never fall below 10c, preferring a mean annual temperature in the range 25 - 35c, whilst tolerating 20 - 45c[418 ]. The mean annual rainfall it prefers is 1,000 - 2,000mm, though it can tolerate 500 - 3,000mm[418 ]. The driest month has 25mm or more rain[297 ]. Prefers a sunny position[419 ]. Requires a well-drained soil[297 ]. Prefers a rich soil, though it also succeeds in poor soils[300 , 418 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 6.5, though it can tolerate from 5 - 7.5[418 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant[418 ]. Plants are fairly fire tolerant[418 ].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a partially shaded position in individual containers. A low germination rate can usually be expected, with the seed taking more than a year to sprout[419 ]. Some people scarify the seed and then soak it in water for as long as several weeks in order to get it to germinate[297 ].",
