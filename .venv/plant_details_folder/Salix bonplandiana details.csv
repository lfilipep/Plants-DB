Dynamic accumulator.",
22,Cultivation Details,"Management: Coppice: Cut to the ground repeatedly - resprouting vigorously. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Other Systems: Chinampas: Aquaforestry. Long, narrow raised beds built in swamps.,Regional Crop: These crops have been domesticated and cultivated regionally but have not been adopted elsewhere and are typically not traded globally, Examples in this broad category include perennial cottons and many nuts and staple fruits.",
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Management: Coppice  Other Systems: Chinampas  Regional CropClimate: tropical highlands. Humidity: aquatic. A low tolerance to shade.  Tolerant of acid soils, excessively humid. Ideal to grow in the margins of rivers. Becomes evergreen southward in Mexico. Carbon Farming Solutions - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: coppice (Describes the non-destructive management systems that are used in cultivation) [1-1].",
24,Plant Propagation,"Asexual reproduction - hardwood cuttings, up to 1.5 m long and plant early spring so that they take root quickly. Seed (seedlings). Seedlings to maintain high humidity until the seedlings have been established",
