See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 3 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower in June. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,"Fruit: ,Shoots: ,Stem: this often intergrades into leaves.","Tea: the various herb teas that can be used in place of tea, plus the genuine article.","Fruit - raw or cooked and used in pies, preserves etc[2, 3, 34, 62, 85, 101, 183]. It is of variable quality, with the finest forms having a rich acid flavour[2]. The hemispherical fruit is about 15mm in diameter[200]. Young shoots - raw or cooked like rhubarb[101, 161, 183, 257]. They are harvested as they emerge through the soil in the spring, and whilst they are still tender, and then peeled[K]. A tea is made from the leaves and another from the bark of the root[161, 183], 257.","Astringent: Produces contraction in living tissue, reducing the flow of secretions and discharges of blood, mucus, diarrhoea etc.,Cathartic: A strong laxative but less violent than a purgative.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.,Pectoral: Relieves respiratory diseases, a remedy for chest diseases.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,TB: Plants used in the treatment of tuberculosis,VD: Used in the treatment of venereal disease","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

A decoction of the roots has been used in the treatment of gonorrhoea[257]. The root has been chewed in the treatment of coughs and toothache[257]. An infusion of the roots has been used as a wash for sore eyes[257]. The root has been used, combined with Hypericum spp, to treat the first stages of consumption[257]. An infusion of the astringent root bark is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery[213, 222]. The leaves are highly astringent[257]. A decoction is used in the treatment of bowel complaints[257]. A tea made from the leaves is used as a wash for old and foul sores, ulcers and boils[222, 257].

Sometimes cultivated, especially in N. America, for its edible fruit[183], it is a parent of many named varieties[1, 34]. This species is a raspberry with biennial stems, it produces a number of new stems each year from the perennial rootstock, these stems fruit in their second year and then die[200]. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus[200]. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available. The plant growth habit is a running thicket former forming a colony from shoots away from the crown spreading indefinitely [1-2]. The root pattern is flat with shallow roots forming a plate near the soil surface [1-2]. The root pattern is suckering with new plants from underground runners away from the plant [1-2].","Seed - requires stratification and is best sown in early autumn in a cold frame. Stored seed requires one month stratification at about 3°c and is best sown as early as possible in the year. Prick out the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a cold frame. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[200]. Tip layering in July. Plant out in autumn. Division in early spring or just before leaf-fall in the autumn[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
