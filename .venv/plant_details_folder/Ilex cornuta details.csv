24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Landscape Uses:Border, Espalier, Pest tolerant, Screen, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most soils that are not water-logged[200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. Resents root disturbance, especially as the plants get older[11]. It is best to place the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, perhaps giving some winter protection for their first year or two[K]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back into old wood if required[188]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It can take 18 months to germinate. Stored seed generally requires two winters and a summer before it will germinate and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. Scarification, followed by a warm stratification and then a cold stratification may speed up the germination time[78, 80]. The seedlings are rather slow-growing. Pot them up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame for their first year. It is possible to plant them out into a nursery bed in late spring of the following year, but they should not be left here for more than two years since they do not like being transplanted. Alternatively, grow them on in their pots for a second season and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them a good mulch and some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of almost ripe wood with a heel, August in a shaded position in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months before potting up. Layering in October. Takes 2 years."
