Main Bloom Time: Early spring, Late spring, Mid spring. Form: Rounded, Vase.","Ilex cornuta is an evergreen Shrub growing to 4 m (13ft) by 5 m (16ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 6. It is in leaf all year, in flower in April, and the seeds ripen from October to December. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required).  and is pollinated by Bees. The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,Fruit: ,,The fruit is thin-skinned with a sweet taste[178].

Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Abortifacient  Carminative  Contraceptive  Febrifuge  TonicThe whole plant is abortifacient, carminative, contraceptive, febrifuge and tonic[147, 178]. It particularly strengthens the back and knees[147]. The leaf is made into a tea which is said to be contraceptive if used by women and is also used for termination pregnancies[218]. The stem bark is tonic[218]. The whole plant is used in the treatment of arthritis, recurring fever in pulmonary tuberculosis, tubercular lymph nodes, joint pained and lumbago[147, 218].",,None known,,"Landscape Uses:Border, Espalier, Pest tolerant, Screen, Standard, Specimen, Street tree. Succeeds in most soils that are not water-logged[200]. Plants are hardy to about -15°c[184]. Resents root disturbance, especially as the plants get older[11]. It is best to place the plants into their permanent positions as soon as possible, perhaps giving some winter protection for their first year or two[K]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut right back into old wood if required[188]. A number of named forms have been developed for their ornamental value[182]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.  Special Features:Not North American native, Inconspicuous flowers or blooms.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in the autumn in a cold frame. It can take 18 months to germinate. Stored seed generally requires two winters and a summer before it will germinate and should be sown as soon as possible in a cold frame. Scarification, followed by a warm stratification and then a cold stratification may speed up the germination time[78, 80]. The seedlings are rather slow-growing. Pot them up into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in light shade in a cold frame for their first year. It is possible to plant them out into a nursery bed in late spring of the following year, but they should not be left here for more than two years since they do not like being transplanted. Alternatively, grow them on in their pots for a second season and then plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer. Give them a good mulch and some protection for their first winter outdoors. Cuttings of almost ripe wood with a heel, August in a shaded position in a cold frame. Leave for 12 months before potting up. Layering in October. Takes 2 years.",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
