23,Cultivation Details Description,"We have very little information on this species, it probably requires a well drained light fertile soil in a sunny position. One report says that it is not hardy in Britain requiring greenhouse or half-hardy treatment[1]. We have grown it in the past in Cornwall, it survived 3 winters in a cold greenhouse with us before succumbing to slugs."
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse[K]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Root cuttings."
