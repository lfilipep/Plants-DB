They are rich in vitamin B1, contain a moderate content of vitamin C and a little vitamin A[179]. Flowers - raw[116]. Blanched briefly and added to salads[183]. The centre of the flower is bitter so only the petals are normally used[206]. A fragrant pickle known as 'kikumi' is made from the petals in Japan[183]."

Chop suey greens are commonly cultivated as a vegetable in the Orient and are becoming better known in the West[200]. There are many named varieties[183]. It takes 4 - 5 weeks from sowing the seed to the first harvest when plants are grown on the cut and come again principle[206]. Plants often self-sow when they are well-sited and the soil is disturbed by hoeing etc[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - surface-sow in spring to early autumn in situ. The seed usually germinates within 10 - 18 days at 15°c[206]. Successional sowings can be made at intervals of a few weeks in order to ensure a constant supply of young plants[206]. Autumn sowings succeed in mild areas[164]. An autumn sowing under cover will often supply leaves all winter[206].
