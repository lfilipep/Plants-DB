0,Clematis columbiana,Rock Clematis,Ranunculaceae,4-8,"Although no reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, some if not all members of this genus are mildly poisonous. The toxic principle is dissipated by heat or by drying[65].","Dry to moist soils of woods and thickets, from valleys to around 2,500 metres in the mountains[212].",Western N. America - British Columbia to Colorado and Oregon.,(0 of 5),(1 of 5),No,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ClematisColumbiana.gif, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/ClematisColumbiana2.gif",,"Clematis columbiana is a deciduous Climber growing to 3 m (9ft 10in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 4.  It is in flower from June to July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees, flies.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Woodland Garden Dappled Shade; Shady Edge;,None known,"Eczema: Used in the treatment of eczema - a chronic health condition that affects the skin, causing redness, dryness, itching and infections.,Foot care: Plants that are used in various ways to treat foot problems.,Salve: Soothes and heals damaged skin.,Skin: Plants used in miscellaneous treatments for the skin.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Eczema  Foot care  Salve  SkinA poultice of the pounded, dampened leaves has been applied to the feet to treat sweaty feet[257]. A cold infusion of the plant can be used as a lotion on swollen knees and ankles[257]. The plant has been used as a head wash and to treat scabs and eczema[257].","Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.,Insulation: Providing insulation against extremes of temperature, sound or electricity.,Tinder: Used for starting fires. See also Kindling.","The seed floss makes an excellent tinder for starting fires, a spark from a flint will quickly ignite it[212]. The seed floss can be used as an insulation in shoes etc[212]. An infusion of the leaves alone, or the leaves and stems, has been used as a hair wash to prevent gray hair[257].",,"Prefers a deep moist soil with its roots in the shade[11, 200]. Dislikes poorly-drained heavy clay soils, but grows well in clay if grit is added for drainage[11, 200]. Dislikes light sandy soils[11]. Does well on chalk[1]. Succeeds in acid as well as alkaline soils[200]. When planting out, in order to avoid the disease 'clematis wilt', it is best to plant the rootball about 8cm deeper in the soil. This will also serve to build up a good root crown of growth buds[200]. A twining plant[182]. The leafstalks wrap themselves around twigs and branches for support. When a side of the stalk touches an object, the growth on that side slows down whilst the other side grows at its normal rate - this causes the leaf stalk to entwine the object it is touching[212]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A greedy plant, inhibiting the growth of nearby plants, especially legumes[54].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame[164, 200]. Sow stored seed as soon as it is obtained in a cold frame. Pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and remove as much of the tail and outer coat as possible[164]. A period of cold stratification is beneficial[164]. The seed germinates in 1 - 9 months or more at 20°c[164]. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in a cold frame for the first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Internodal cuttings of soft to semi-ripe wood, late spring in sandy soil in a frame[200]. Layering of old stems in late winter or early spring[200]. Layering of current seasons growth in early summer[200].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
