25,Cultivation Details Description,"Agroforestry Services: Crop shade  Global Crop  Industrial Crop: Fiber  Management: Managed Multistem  Other Systems: Dyke-pond  Other Systems: Homegarden  Other Systems: Multistrata  Staple Crop: Basic StarchA plant of the moist to humid tropics and subtropics, where it is found at elevations up to 2,400 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 23 - 33°c, but can tolerate 12 - 42°c[418]. The optimal temperature for fruit production is about 27°c, and night time temperatures should not fall much below 18°c when the fruit is ripening or flavour can be impaired[200]. It is not frost tolerant and can be killed by temperatures of 1°c or lower[418]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,200 - 3,600mm, but tolerates 650 - 5,000mm[418].Requires a sunny sheltered position in a well-drained fertile soil with a pH between 6 and 7.5[200]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4 - 8.4[418].Wild plants are diploid (2n = 22) and bear fruits containing numerous seeds making them inedible. Cultivated plants are triploid (2n = 33) and bear seedless, edible fruits; such plants have been called M. acuminata ‘Dwarf Cavendish’ (M. cavendishii Lambert ex Paxton; M. chinensis Sweet; M. nana Loureiro)[266]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow the large seed in individual pots in the spring in a warm greenhouse at about 20°c[200]. Grow the seedlings on in a rich soil, giving occasional liquid feeds. Keep the plants in the greenhouse for at least three years before trying them outdoors. Division of suckers in late spring. Dig up the suckers with care, trying to cause the least disturbance to the main plant. Pot them up and grow them on in a lightly shaded position in a greenhouse until they are well established."
