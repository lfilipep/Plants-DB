It can be found in tropical Africa. Established plants are drought-tolerant. Young leafy shoots are edible, eaten as a potherb or added to soups. Leaf decoctions are used in the treatment of fever, malaria, scabies, diarrhea, cough, dysentery, headache, stomach pains, and hepatitis. It is also a laxative and fertility inducer. Young twigs are chewed as a stomachic tonic and appetite stimulant. Root extracts are used for malaria, gastrointestinal disorders, and sexually transmitted diseases. Bark infusions are used against fever and diarrhea while dried flowers are for stomach disorders. Bitterleaf is sometimes grown as a hedge or to prevent soil erosion. It is a useful control agent against plant diseases. Young twigs are used as toothpicks or chew sticks. The wood is used for timber, fuel, and charcoal.","Gymnanthemum amygdalinum is an evergreen Shrub growing to 8 m (26ft) by 7 m (23ft) at a medium rate.  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.",Bracheilema paniculatum R.Br. Cacalia amygdalina Kuntze Cheliusia abyssinica Sch.Bip. ex A.Rich.

Eaten as a potherb or added to soups[301 ]. The leaves often have an intensely bitter flavour, but forms exist that are nearly free of bitterness[301 ]. The plant should be harvested by trimming off the ends of whole shoots[299 ]. This encourages new growth whereas simply removing leaves can slow down growth[299 ].","Antidiarrhoeal: Provides symptomatic relief for diarrhoea. Also see Astringent.,Bitter: Increases the appetite and stimulates digestion by acting on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Also increases the flow of bile, stimulates repair of the gut wall lining and regulates the secretion of insulin and glucogen.,Dysentery: Used in treating dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus.,Febrifuge: Reduces fevers.,Infertility: Used in treating problems of human fertility.,Laxative: Stimulates bowel movements in a fairly gentle manner.,Malaria: Treats malaria - an acute febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites spread to people through the bites of mosquitos.,Mouthwash: Treats problems such as mouth ulcers.,Parasiticide: Treats external parasites such as ringworm This should perhaps be joined with Parasiticide in ,Stomachic: Aids and improves the action of the stomach.,Tonic: Improves general health. Slower acting than a stimulant, it brings steady improvement.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidiarrhoeal  Bitter  Dysentery  Febrifuge  Infertility  Laxative  Malaria  Mouthwash  Parasiticide  Stomachic  TonicBitterleaf is commonly used in traditional medicine in Africa. Leaf decoctions are used to treat fever, malaria, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis and cough, as a laxative and as a fertility inducer[299 ]. They are also used as a medicine for scabies, headache and stomach-ache. Leaves are placed on a wound as a substitute for iodine[299 ]. The bitterness in the leaves is caused by sesquiterpene lactones and steroid glucosides. Some of these compounds have significant antiparasitic activity, especially vernodalin and vernonioside B1. Vernolepin showed platelet anti-aggregating properties. Vernodalin and vernomygdin have cytotoxic activity[299 ]. Young twigs are chewed as a stomachic tonic and appetite stimulant[301 ]. One of the most common medicinal uses of Vernonia amygdalina is as a treatment against intestinal worms including nematodes[299 ]. Not only humans but also chimpanzees ingest the bitter pith of Vernonia amygdalina for the control of intestinal nematode infections[299 ]. Root extracts are used as treatment against malaria and gastrointestinal disorders[299 ]. In Zimbabwe a root infusion is used to treat sexually transmitted diseases[299 ]. Bark infusions are also taken to treat fever and diarrhoea, dried flowers against stomach disorders[299 ]","Charcoal: Used for fuel, drawing, deodorant, filter, fertilizer etc.,Fencing: Plants that can be used for fencing.,Fuel: Usually wood, plant materials that have been mentioned as being a good fuel.,Hedge: Plants that can be grown as hedges.,Parasiticide: Kills external body parasites such as hair lice.,Plant breeding: Used in producing new species of plants or improved varieties.,Soil stabilization: Plants that can be grown in places such as sand dunes in order to prevent erosion by wind, water or other agents.,Teeth: Plants used to clean and care for the teeth.,Wood: A list of the trees and shrubs that are noted for having useful wood.","Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes grown as a hedge[299 ]. The branches are termite resistant and are used as stakes to line out fields and as a live fence[299 , 418 ]. The tree is sometimes planted to prevent soil erosion[418 ]. Other Uses: Bitterleaf is useful as a control agent against diseases in plants[299 ]. The ash from burnt branches is used to control seed-borne fungi, thus ameliorating seed viability and germination capacity[299 ]. Young twigs are used as toothpicks or chewing sticks[299 ]. They have been shown to contain substances that have a marked activity against bacteria that cause gum diseases[299 ]. They also act to stimulate the appetite[418 ]. The wood is used for timber[418 ]. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal[303 , 418 ]. Dry stems and branches provide fuel[299 ].",,"A plant of the tropics, where it is found at elevations from 600 - 2,800 metres. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 26°c, but can tolerate 16 - 35°c[418 ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 750 - 2,000mm, but tolerates 600 - 2,400mm[418 ]. Requires a position in full sun[299 ]. Succeeds on most soil types, though it grows best in well-drained, humus-rich soils[299 , 418 ]. Plants prefer a moist environment, though they are fairly drought tolerant once established[299 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7, tolerating 5 - 7.5[418 ]. Plants can be coppiced[303 ]. Cultivated forms have been selected that are less bitter than the wild plant[299 ].
