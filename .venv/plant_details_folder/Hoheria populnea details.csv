See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 8 and is frost tender. It is in leaf all year, in flower from August to September. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Bees. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",,Woodland Garden Secondary; Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade;,None known,"Demulcent: Soothes, lubricates and softens irritated tissues, especially the mucous membranes.,Ophthalmic: Treats eye complaints.","Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants.

It is used for making ropes, cord etc[46, 61]. The fibre is also used as ornamentation in basket making and for bonnets etc[128].  - white, very tough. Used by cabinet makers, it also makes an excellent fuel[128].",,"Grows in any good, well-drained soil[1]. Requires a position in full sun[182] or dappled shade[200], succeeding in acid or alkaline soils[182]. Plants grown in a soil that is overly rich produce a lot of sappy growth that is more susceptible to frost damage[200]. Withstands strong winds but is best if given protection from cold north-easterly winds[200]. Another report says that it requires a position sheltered from strong winds[125]. Prefers a moist atmosphere[125]. Prefers a maritime climate[200]. Plants grow best in an open clearing in a woodland garden[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it is only hardy in the milder areas of the country[1, 11, 49], tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[182]. Plants are prone to damage at temperatures lower than -5°c[200]. A very variable plant[11], leaves of young plants are often deeply lobed but on older plants they are more or less entire and toothed[126, 182]. Juvenile plants also have a compact shrubby habit, quite unlike the mature plant[200]. There are some named forms selected for their ornamental value[219]. Plants are subject to attacks by the coral-spot fungus, especially after cool wet summers[126]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200]. A good butterfly plant[200].","Seed - sow autumn in a greenhouse. It usually germinates freely[200]. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a shady position in a frame. The cuttings should be put in 12cm pots. A fair to good percentage[78]. Layering in April. Takes 12 months[78].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens. Filter to search native plants to your area.
