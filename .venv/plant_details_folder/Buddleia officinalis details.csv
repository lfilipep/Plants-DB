The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought.

22,Cultivation Details,,
23,Cultivation Details Description,"Requires a sunny position[11, 182]. Prefers a rich loamy soil but succeeds in most well-drained soils[1, 11, 200]. Very tolerant of alkaline soils[200]. Requires a site sheltered from the wind because the leaves are easily damaged[260]. Tolerating temperatures down to about -10°c[184], this species is hardy in Cornwall[11, 166] but not in most parts of Britain[1]. It resprouts freely from the base if cut back by severe weather[200]. A very ornamental plant[1], it hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. Plants flower on the current years growth and can be pruned back hard in spring to encourage freer flowering[182]. An excellent plant for bees and butterflies[30]. Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required.",
24,Plant Propagation,"Seed - cold stratify for 4 weeks at 4°c[138] and surface sow the seed in February/March in a greenhouse[78, 113] (the pre-chilling might not be required for this species). Germination usually takes place within 3 - 4 weeks at 21°c[138]. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Seedlings are inclined to damp off and so should be watered with care and kept well-ventilated[78]. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame[11, 113]. Use short side-shoots[78]. Very high percentage[113]. Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, 15 - 20cm long, October/November in a frame[200].",
