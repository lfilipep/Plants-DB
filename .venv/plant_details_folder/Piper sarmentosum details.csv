24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"It prefers rich, well-drained soil with partial shade but can tolerate full shade. It likes moist soil but does not tolerate waterlogging. Frost will damage the leaves but not kill the plant once it is well established. The plant can be invasive, so it needs to be given space to roam - it does well as an understorey plant in a woodland [296 ]. It makes a good ground cover under trees in subtropical and tropical areas. It thrives in the right position and can be difficult to remove because of its suckering habit. It can be grown successfully in colder regions in a hanging basket or large pot and moved to a warm, sheltered position in winter. The stems can be up to 10 metres long, though they tend to creep along the ground with off-shoots to 0.5m [266 ]. A dioecious plant, both male and female forms need to be grown if seed is required [266 ]. It grows in forests in wet places near villages and from sea level to 1000 m altitude in S China [1-4]. In Hawaii, it is grown under shade cloth [1-4]. Dry winds turn the leaves brown, spoiling their appearance [1-4].",
