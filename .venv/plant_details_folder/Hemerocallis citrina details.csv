18,Edible Uses,,
19,Edible Uses Description,"Leaves and young shoots - cooked[205]. They must be consumed when very young or else they become fibrous[K]. Flowers and flower buds - raw or cooked[105, 177]. The flowers can be dried and used as a thickener in soups etc. The slender trumpets vary from 12 - 17cm long[205]. There can be from 7 to 65 buds on a flowering stem[205]. The flower buds contain about 43mg vitamin C per 100g, 983 IU vitamin A and 3.1% protein[205]. Root - raw or cooked[205]. The flavour is somewhat radish-like but not so sharp[205].",
20,Medicinal Uses,"Antidote: Counters poisoning.,Diuretic: Acts on the kidneys, promoting the flow of urine.,Vitamin C: Plants good for their vitamin C content",
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.Antidote  Diuretic  Vitamin CThe juice of the roots is an effective antidote in cases of arsenic poisoning[205]. A tea made from the boiled roots is used as a diuretic[205].,

23,Other Uses Description,The tough dried foliage is plaited into cord and used for making footwear[205].,
24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Succeeds in most soils[1], including dry ones, preferring a rich moist soil[200]. Grows well in heavy clay soils. Succeeding in sun or shade, it produces more flowers in a sunny position though these flowers can be shorter-lived in very sunny positions[205]. Succeeds in short grass if the soil is moist[1]. Prefers a pH between 6 and 7[200]. Plants are hardy to at least -20°c[187]. Widely cultivated in China for its edible flowers, especially in Hunan province[266]. Hybridizes freely with other members of this genus[200]. This species is said to be self-incompatible[127, 205]. Many of the plants in cultivation under this name are H. thunbergii[205]. The sub-species H. citrina vespertina (Hara.)Erhardt. is a very free-flowering form, producing up to 75 buds per scape and capable of flowering from July to October if the weather is suitable[205]. The plant forms a loose spreading clump[K]. The roots form pseudobulbs[205]. Plants take a year or two to become established after being moved[1]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. The plants are very susceptible to slug and snail damage, the young growth in spring is especially at risk[200]. Individual flowers are very short-lived, they open in the late afternoon and die in the morning[200]. However, plants produce a succession of flowers for several weeks of the summer. The number of flowers on a scape varies from 7 to 65[205]. The flowers have a lemony scent[205]. Another report says that they have a pronounced honeysuckle scent[245].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow in the middle of spring in a greenhouse. Germination is usually fairly rapid and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow the plants on for their first winter in a greenhouse and plant out in late spring[K]. Division in spring or after flowering in late summer or autumn[200]. Division is very quick and easy, succeeding at almost any time of the year[K]. Larger clumps can be replanted direct into their permanent positions, though it is best to pot up smaller clumps and grow them on in a cold frame until they are rooting well. Plant them out in the spring.",
