Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure.",F. kirkii.,Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Ground Cover; East Wall. By.,Fruit: ,,"Fruit - raw. It might be edible, but it is not very nice[K]. The fruit is about 18mm in diameter[200].",,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.None known,,The plant makes a carpet of growth and can be used for ground cover when spaced about 60cm apart each way[208].,,"Succeeds in any fertile well-drained circum-neutral soil[200]. Succeeds in a good loam if sand and leafmold are added[1]. Plants flower better when grown in a poor sandy soil[188]. This species is only hardy in the mildest parts of Britain, tolerating temperatures down to about -3°c[260], It grows and fruits well in Cornwall[11]. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun[K]. The plant produces long trailing stems and grows well in hanging baskets[260]. The wild plant can be dioecoius or monoecious, but the form cultivated in Britain is self-fertile[11]. Plants seem to be immune to the predations of rabbits[233]. A good bee plant[108].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe[200] though it can also be sown in the spring[1]. Surface sow the seed in pots in a warm greenhouse and do not allow the compost to dry out[200]. Germination should take place in less than 6 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of greenwood, 5 - 8cm long, May/June in a frame. Quick and easy, a high percentage take[78, K]. Overwinter in the greenhouse for the first year and plant out after the last expected frosts. Inter-nodal cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very quick and easy, treat as greenwood cuttings above[K]. Cuttings usually succeed at any time during the growing season[K].",If available other names are mentioned here,"Search over 900 plants ideal for food forests and permaculture gardens.
