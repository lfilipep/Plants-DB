13,Summary,,
14,Physical Characteristics,"Phleum pratense is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",

18,Edible Uses,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Historic Crop: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas. Perennials include perennial beans, nuts, leaf protein concentrates, and edible milks.",

20,Medicinal Uses,Cancer: Used in the treatment of cancer.,
21,Medicinal Uses Description,Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.CancerStored sterile timothy extracts arrested the growth of Sarcoma 45 and other tumour types[269].,
22,Other Uses,"Biomass: Provides a large quantity of plant material that can be converted into fuel etc.,Fodder: Food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them) rather than forage for themselves.,Hair: Plants used as hair shampoos, tonics, to treat balding etc.",
23,Other Uses Description,The stems have been used to make hair brushes[257]. The plant can yield up to 15 tonnes of plant material per hectare and is a potential source of biomass[269].,
24,Cultivation Details,"Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually. Non-destructive management systems maintaining the soil organic carbon.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Balanced carb: (0-15 percent protein, 0-15 percent oil, with at least one over 5 percent). The carbohydrates are from either starch or sugar. Annuals include maize, wheat, rice, and potato. Perennials include chestnuts, carob, perennial fruits, nuts, cereals, pseudocereals, woody pods, and acorns.",
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Fodder: Pasture  Management: Hay  Management: Standard  Staple Crop: Balanced carbAn easily grown plant, it succeeds in a sunny position in any ordinary soil[200]. The plant is not drought tolerant[269]. Timothy grass is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 35 to 176cm, an annual temperature range of 4.4 to 18.6°C, and a pH of 4.5 to 7.8[269]. The plant is best adapted to a cool, humid, temperate climate, growing best on rather heavy, deep and moist or even wet soils[269]. Yields are lower on light dry soils and sands[269]. The optimum temperature for growth is 18.3° - 21.6°C varying with day/night temperatures of 15°/10°C and 21°/15°C[269]. Timothy grass is a very variable species that is commonly grown as a hay grass. Several named forms have been develped[17, 269]. A short-lived perennial it is a common cause of hayfever[257]. An attractive addition to the wild flower meadow, the inflorescence dries and dyes well so is used in dried flower displays[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in situ, only just covering the seed. If seed is in short supply, it can be surface sown in a pot in a cold frame. Ensure the pot does not dry out. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant out in the summer. Division in spring.",
