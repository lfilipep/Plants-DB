The pollen contains several flavonol-glycosides, among them dactylin (isorhamnetin-31,4-diglucoside)[269].","Common in meadows throughout Britain, though rare in the north[17].",Britain.,(0 of 5),(1 of 5),Yes,(1 of 5),"Fully Hardy,Moist Soil,Semi-shade,Full sun","https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PhleumPratense.jpg, https://pfaf.org/../Admin/PlantImages/PhleumPratense2.jpg",,"Phleum pratense is a PERENNIAL growing to 1 m (3ft 3in).  See above for USDA hardiness. It is hardy to UK zone 5.  It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Wind.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: mildly acid, neutral and basic (mildly alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil.",,Meadow;,,"Agroforestry Services: Nitrogen: Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae.,Historic Crop: These crops were once cultivated but have been abandoned. The reasons for abandonment may include colonization, genocide, market pressures, the arrival of superior crops from elsewhere, and so forth.,Management: Standard: Plants grow to their standard height. Harvest fruit, seeds, or other products. Non-Destructive management systems.,Staple Crop: Protein: (16+ percent protein, 0-15 percent oil). Annuals include beans, chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, and pigeon peas.

The plant can yield up to 15 tonnes of plant material per hectare and is a potential source of biomass[269].,"Fodder: Pasture: Enclosed tracts of farmland mainly of grasses, with an interspersion of legumes and other forbs (non-grass herbaceous plants).,Management: Hay: Cut to the ground and harvested annually.

The plant is not drought tolerant[269]. Timothy grass is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation in the range of 35 to 176cm, an annual temperature range of 4.4 to 18.6°C, and a pH of 4.5 to 7.8[269]. The plant is best adapted to a cool, humid, temperate climate, growing best on rather heavy, deep and moist or even wet soils[269]. Yields are lower on light dry soils and sands[269]. The optimum temperature for growth is 18.3° - 21.6°C varying with day/night temperatures of 15°/10°C and 21°/15°C[269]. Timothy grass is a very variable species that is commonly grown as a hay grass. Several named forms have been develped[17, 269]. A short-lived perennial it is a common cause of hayfever[257]. An attractive addition to the wild flower meadow, the inflorescence dries and dyes well so is used in dried flower displays[200].","Seed - sow spring in situ, only just covering the seed. If seed is in short supply, it can be surface sown in a pot in a cold frame. Ensure the pot does not dry out. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant out in the summer.
