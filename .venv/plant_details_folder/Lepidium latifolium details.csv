24,Cultivation Details,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"A very easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils in sun or light shade. Plants have been surviving quite happily with us, and are still spreading freely, in dense grass that is rarely cut[K]. Dittander was formerly cultivated as a food condiment in Britain and in ancient Greece[17, 183]. It is a very invasive plant, capable of spreading more than a metre per year by means of its aggressive root system[K]. It produces new growth early in the year and so can be a useful salad ingredient in late winter[K]."
26,Plant Propagation,"Seed - sow spring in a cold frame. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and plant them out in the spring. Division in spring. Plant them out direct into their permanent positions. Division is very simple and succeeds at almost any time of the year[K]."
