Requires a humus-rich, moist but well-drained soil and a position in dappled shade where it can grow up towards the sun[262 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, disliking very acid or very alkaline conditions[262 ]. Passiflora species tend to flower and fruit more freely when grown in soils of only moderate fertility[200 ]. Plants are very tolerant of pruning and can be cut back to ground level if required to rejuvenate the plant[202 ]. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200 ].","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe along with the pulp which will help break down the seed coat and speed up germination[262]. Stored seed should be soaked for 24 hours in warm water and germination time can be reduced if the seed is then mixed with the juice of a fresh passion fruit (of any species)[262 ]. Even so, it can take 12 months for stored seed to germinate[262 ]. Place the seed tray in a shady position, maintaining a temperature around 19 - 24c[262 ]. Prick the seedlings out into individual containers as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when large enough[262 ]. Cuttings of young shoots, taken at the nodes. The cuttings root best in a neutral to slightly acid compost, but 100% sharp sand also produces good results[262 ]. Cuttings of fully mature wood taken at a node. They can take 3 months, but there is usually a high percentage[3 ]. Layering. Very easy[262 ].
