24,Cultivation Details,,
25,Cultivation Details Description,"Easily grown in any ordinary garden soil[1]. Prefers a light well-drained moderately fertile soil in full sun[200]. A soil that is too rich encourages foliar growth at the expense of flowering[200]. Tolerates maritime exposure[200]. An unknown species from Greece given to us by Bill of Falmouth. It is very fast growing, even in a very exposed position but is short lived, usually only 3 - 4 years before it starts breaking up in the wind. The plant is probably too floriferous for its own good but if self-sows freely. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus[200].",
26,Plant Propagation,Seed - sow spring in a cold frame and only just cover the seed[200]. Germination is usually quick and good. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and plant them out in early summer[K]. Basal cuttings in spring. Cuttings of softwood in June/July[188].,
