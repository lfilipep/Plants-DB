23,Other Uses Description,"The flowering stems and leaves are used for thatching, in basketry, making brooms etc[61, 66, 100]. The rhizomes are used for making rope and mats[115]. A fibre obtained from the stems is used for making paper[189]. The stems are harvested in the summer, cut into usable pieces and soaked for 24 hours in clear water before cooking for 2 hours with soda ash. Beat the fibres in a ball mill for 1½ hours. The fibres make a tan-brown paper[189]. This plant has an extensive root system and grows naturally in sand dunes along the coast where it is very important for its action of binding the dunes and therefore allowing other plants to grow. It is much planted in sand dunes and other similar habitats for erosion control[200].",
